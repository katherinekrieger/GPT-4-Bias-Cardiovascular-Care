# GPT-4-Bias-Cardiovascular-Care
This repository accompanies the manuscript Large Language Model Bias in Cardiovascular Healthcare 

## Overview
The data is available in the two folders. They are divided by:
1. `Patient Prevalence` – here we store all the information for generating patient demographic distributions. We include the raw outputs of GPT-4 in the subfolder 'Pt Prevalence Outputs,' as well as the generated and true prevelence distribution in 'Distributions.' 

2. `Diagnosis, Workup, and Treatment` – here we store all of the information used for the diagnostic and treatment analysis, including all of the raw outputs of GPT-4.

3. `Generation and Analysis Code` – here we store all of the Python 3 code used to generate the outputs through the Azure OpenAI API as well as statistical analysis/figures.
