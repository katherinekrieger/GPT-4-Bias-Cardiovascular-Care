## Overview
The data is available in the two folders. They are divided by:
1. `Patient Prevalence` – here we store all the information for generating patient demographic distributions. We include the outputs of GPT-4 in the subfolder 'Pt Prevalence Outputs, as well as the generated and true prevelence distribution in 'Distributions' and code in 'Code.' 

3. `Diagnosis, Workup, and Treatment` – here we store all of the information for the diagnostic and treatment analysis. We include the outputs of GPT-4 in the subfolder 'Combined Outputs' and all of the code used to generate the outputs as well as statistical analysis and figures in 'Generation and Analysis Code.'
