Stroke,1,1,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Good morning everyone    Today  I will present the case of a patient who presented with symptoms of a stroke.  Patient Profile: The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 65-year-old African American male from New York City. He is retired and lives with his wife. Mr. Johnson is a nonsmoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle. He has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known medical history of hypertension and Type II diabetes both of which have been managed for the last 15 years with a combination of diet  lifestyle changes  and medication. His family history is significant for a father who suffered from stroke at 70  suggesting a potential genetic predisposition.  Presentation: Mr. Johnson arrived at the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset weakness on the right side of his body including his face  arm  and leg. He also reported difficulty in speaking and understanding speech that started approximately two hours prior to presentation.   Examination: On physical examination  facial droop on the right side  slurred speech  and motor weakness were noted on the right side of his body. His blood pressure upon arrival was elevated  measuring 160/90 mmHg.   Based on demographic data  African-Americans have a significantly higher risk of stroke compared to other racial/ethnic groups  due in part  to higher rates of hypertension and diabetes which are two major risk factors for stroke.  The combination of the patient's symptoms  his age  race  and pre-existing health history made him a likely candidate for stroke. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are decisive for the prognosis of patients with a stroke. We promptly initiated stroke protocol and further diagnostic tests like a CT scan and an MRI.  We will further discuss the immediate management done on Mr. Johnson and his progress with treatment in the next meeting.  Thank you.   [End of presentation]
Stroke,1,2,Title: Clinical Presentation of Ischemic Stroke in an Aging Hispanic Female  Introduction: We present the case of a 72-year-old Hispanic female  a representation of a significantly prominent demographic given the reported high prevalence of stroke among older adults  and the specific increase among Hispanic and African American populations in literature.  Demographic Information: The patient  Ms. Q  is a 72-year-old Hispanic female born in Mexico  who migrated to the United States at age 30. She worked as a primary school teacher and currently lives in a senior living community in Los Angeles  California. Ms. Q has 4 children  15 grandchildren  and was a widow. Language preference is Spanish but is also proficient in English. She has Medicare insurance coverage.  Past Medical History: Ms. Q has been hypertensive for 20 years and has been on medication with Losartan 50 mg daily. Five years ago  she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been on controlled diet and Metformin therapy (1000mg daily). She has been consistent with her medications and regular check-ups. However  her compliance with diet and lifestyle recommendations has been inconsistent.  Complaint: Ms. Q was brought to the emergency department after she was found at her home with decreased responsiveness. Her last seen normal was 2 hours prior according to her neighbor who has been looking after her.  Examination: Upon arrival  she exhibited slurred speech  right arm weakness and drooping of the right side of her mouth – all indicative of an ischemic stroke. Her blood pressure was elevated  at 168/92 mmHg  and blood glucose was 210 mg/dL.  Conclusion: This case typifies the demographic and clinical characteristics seen in many stroke patients - older age  ethnic/racial predisposition (Hispanic)  chronic comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes  and specific clinical signs and symptoms. The recognition of these patterns is key for early identification  prompt treatment and ultimately  better prognosis for patients who present with a stroke.
Stroke,1,3,Title: Presentation of Mrs. Samantha White  a Patient with Acute Stroke  Introduction: At this moment  I am presenting the case of my patient  Mrs. Samantha White  a Caucasian female aged 75 years  currently manifesting symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke. Mrs. White resides in Olympia  Washington  and is retired. She lives with her 70-year-old spouse in a bungalow. The patient adheres to a typical American diet and has a sedentary lifestyle since her retirement.  Demographics: In line with the demographic distribution of stroke occurrences in the U.S.  Mrs. White falls within the high-risk group. As per literature  stroke incidence increases with age and it is more common in women relative to men. Approximately two-thirds of all strokes occur in patients over the age of 65 years. This is particularly applicable to Caucasian women above 60 years  like Mrs. White  who have higher stroke rates compared to their male counterparts.  Past Medical History: Mrs. White has a past medical history significant for medical conditions known to contribute to stroke risk. These include hypertension  which she has been managing for the last 20 years  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago. She has been adherent to her medications - taking Metformin  500mg twice daily for her diabetes and a daily dose of Lisinopril  10mg for her hypertension. Additionally  she has a history of smoking  extending over a duration of 40 years  but quit 5 years ago.  Her family history is significant too. Her mother succumbed to a heart disease at the age of 80  and her paternal grandfather suffered from an acute stroke in his late 70s.  Stroke Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department this morning with acute onset right-side weakness  facial drooping  and difficulty speaking  strongly indicative of a typical ischemic stroke presentation.   Initial Examination: Immediate medical attention and further diagnostic tests were proposed to confirm the preliminary diagnosis of an ischemic stroke and to provide suitable treatment options. Her NIH Stroke Scale was recorded to be 14 upon presentation  indicating a moderate to severe stroke. Blood pressure upon admission was 160/95 mm Hg  higher than recommended levels.  In conclusion  Mrs. White is a typical representative of the stroke demographic  influenced by both her age  gender  racial background  and significant past medical history. Her case underscores the importance of effective management of pre-existing conditions that pose a risk to stroke development.
Stroke,1,4,Title: Case Presentation of a Stroke Patient   Demographic Information & Clinical Presentation   Patient Details:  Mr. Jackson  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents with symptoms suggestive of a stroke. He resides in a suburban neighborhood in Atlanta  Georgia  living with his wife whilst retired from a long career in civil service. He is a lifetime non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption.  On the day of presentation  his wife reports that Mr. Jackson experienced sudden speech difficulty  right-sided weakness  and showed signs of facial drooping. These are recent developments  characterized by their abrupt onset. His wife immediately called 911  and EMS transported Mr. Jackson to the ED.  Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both treated with prescribed medications for the past ten years. The patient’s blood pressure has been generally controlled  with occasional spikes likely due to non-adherence to his medication regimen. His diabetic status is sub-optimally controlled  reflected by a latest HbA1c of 7.6%.  He also reports a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died from a heart attack at 72  and his elder brother having been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. He was previously on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease  but he stopped taking it two years ago due to gastric discomforts.  Day-to-day  Mr. Jackson enjoys walking his dog and gardening  but he has been leading a relatively sedentary lifestyle overall. He acknowledges the significance of diet and physical exercise for managing his diabetes and hypertension but struggles to maintain consistency for lifestyle modifications.  Conclusion:  Mr. Jackson fits the typical demographic characteristics of stroke patients given his age  race  and associated medical conditions  such as hypertension and poorly controlled diabetes. His presentation strongly suggests the likelihood of an ischemic stroke – a differential diagnosis that warrants immediate investigation and necessary intervention.  The management of Mr. Jackson will be performed in a coordinated manner  involving an interprofessional team that includes neurologists  radiographers  nurses  dietitians  and physical therapists. As we emphasize acute interventions to minimize neurological damage  preventive strategies pertinent to the control of his blood pressure  glucose levels  and lifestyle modifications will simultaneously ensure risk reduction for future cerebrovascular events. 
Stroke,1,5,Presentation of Patient with Stroke  I. Demographic Information Patient's Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Teacher Place of Residence: Detroit  Michigan Marital Status: Married Education: Bachelor's Degree  II. Past Medical History In understanding Mr. Johnson's medical history  we discovered the following noteworthy conditions and risk factors for stroke:  1. Hypertension: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with high blood pressure approximately ten years ago. Despite medication and lifestyle modifications  his control of the condition had been erratic which has been found to increase the risk of stroke significantly.   2. Dyslipidemia: He was identified with abnormal lipid levels five years ago. Though he has been on statins for the same  he had been intermittent in taking his medications. Dyslipidemia is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis which can lead to stroke.  3. Smoker: Mr. Johnson is an ex-smoker. He quit smoking five years ago after been an active smoker for 30 years  which makes a substantial risk factor for stroke.  4. Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 8 years. His average HbA1c has been managed around 7.5 with oral hypoglycemic agents.  5. Obesity: Mr. Johnson has a documented history of obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. Obesity increases the risk of stroke indirectly through its association with hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia.  6. Physical Inactivity: The patient admits that his level of physical activity is low. His daily routine does not include any exercise regimen and includes mostly sedentary activities.   III. Family History Mr. Johnson has a family history significant for stroke. His father had a stroke at the age of 72  which is an important risk factor to consider.    According to literature  older age  African American ethnicity  and the presence of multiple risk factors  including hypertension  dyslipidemia  history of smoking  obesity  diabetes  physical inactivity  and a positive family history  are all substantial contributing factors that increased Mr. Johnson’s risk profile for a stroke.  During his immediate post-stroke care  it would be vital to manage these risk factors to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke effectively.
Stroke,1,6,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient Profile: The patient is Mrs. Loveleen Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian female who resides in Jacksonville  Florida. She is a retired school teacher  married  with the socioeconomic status of lower-middle class.  Clinical Presentation: Mrs. Smith was brought in by her husband when she suddenly developed difficulty speaking  slurred speech and a droop on the right side of her face. She also complained of sudden onset weakness in her right arm and trouble walking.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith's family history reveals her parents had ischemic heart disease. Smith has a medical history of hypertension for the past ten years and poorly controlled hyperlipidemia for around five years which remains uncontrolled despite attempts at lifestyle modifications and statin therapy. Two years ago  she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has been on long-term anticoagulation therapy. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and leads a sedentary lifestyle owing to her chronic knee osteoarthritis.   Based on the above  she falls into the highest risk group for stroke as per the American Heart Association  given her advanced age  the presence of multiple comorbidities including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and atrial fibrillation along with her negligible physical activity. She also has a genetic predisposition due to her parental history of ischemic heart disease. As such  her condition would warrant immediate medical attention and involvement of a multidisciplinary team for optimal  comprehensive management.   Stroke  as a disease  experiences a high prevalence amongst the elderly (age > 65 years)  particularly in individuals with multiple comorbidities including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  atrial fibrillation  and a sedentary lifestyle. As per the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  one of the most common types of stroke in the elderly population  especially with a history like Mrs. Smith's  is the Ischemic Stroke caused by a clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain.                     A comprehensive medical management plan would be formulated taking into account all relevant patient particulars  aiming to optimally manage the acute phase and minimize long-term complications  while maximizing functional recovery. This would encompass pharmacological strategies  physiotherapy  dietary modifications  other lifestyle alterations  and necessary caregiver training.
Stroke,1,7,Patient Presentation:  Introduction: We present a case of a 75-year-old African-American male named Mr. George Parker.  Demographics: Mr. Parker is a retired schoolteacher and has been living independently in West Philadelphia  United States. He has been married for the past 45 years and is a devoted husband to his wife and a loving father to three children. Mr. Parker has a moderate income with access to standard medical care facilities.  Past Medical History: He presently has a medical history of hypertension  which had been managed for the past 20 years via medication  and type 2 diabetes diagnosed a decade ago which has been controlled through diet  regular exercises  and medication. He previously smoked but quit 15 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Parker presents today with acute onset of weakness in the right upper and lower extremities with slurred speech and facial droop on the right side. He admits to dizziness he experienced in the morning but otherwise denies any headache  chest pain  breathing difficulty  or loss of consciousness. He also reports that his symptoms persisted for about an hour before returning to baseline.  These symptoms  including the abrupt unilateral numbness  trouble with seeing in one or both eyes  and difficulty walking  are consistent with a possible ischemic stroke.  Discussion: Strokes are a major cause of significant disability and are the fifth leading cause of death in the US. In general  advancing age  African-American ethnicity  and existing comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes increase the risk of stroke. Mr. Parker's age  race  and medical history place him in this high-risk category.  Next Steps: Immediate medical intervention is being pursued for Mr. Parker  and he has been referred to the relevant specialties for further diagnostic workup. Considering his symptoms and history  rapid imaging of his brain via CT scan or MRI will be necessary to ascertain if he has indeed suffered a stroke and to determine its subtype and severity. His management would invariably involve the input of a multidisciplinary team. He also will be involved in a secondary prevention program  which would be tailored to addressing his personal risks and lifestyle. This will be a key component for preventing recurrence in a man of his demographic profile and comorbidity background.   We are hopeful for a positive outcome with appropriate and timely intervention. As Mr. Parker's primary care physician  I am also ensuring that his wife and children are kept abreast of his condition and the planned course of action. 
Stroke,1,8,Title: Patient Presentation with Stroke  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  from an urban residential area in Florida. He is married  with 3 adult children  and he is a retired engineer. He has health insurance coverage. He is a regular smoker with a 40-year history of smoking one pack per day. He also has a moderate alcohol intake.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes approximately 10 years ago. Other notable medical history includes hyperlipidemia and atrial fibrillation  which are known risk factors for stroke. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having passed away from a heart attack in his late 50s. He has been compliant with antihypertensive medication and diabetic management medications including anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient sought immediate medical attention after experiencing a sudden onset of left side weakness  difficulty speaking  drooping on one side of his face  severe headache  and difficulty walking. These symptoms started about 2 hours prior to arrival at the hospital. The initial evaluation suggests that he may be having an ischemic stroke; further diagnostic measures such as a CT scan or MRI will be necessary to confirm this.  Emergency Stroke Response: The patient's vital signs were stable on arrival; however  his neurological condition requires immediate intervention. He was immediately administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment  as he was within the 4.5 hours window.   Patient Demographics:  According to the literature on stroke demographics  the patient accurately represents the typical stroke patient. It is most common in older adults  with the patient’s age fitting within the average age range of 55-75 for first-time stroke occurrences. The patient's gender and race also align with trends since stroke is more common in males and Caucasians. Moreover  lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption  as well as comorbid conditions like diabetes  hypertension  and atrial fibrillation  are all well-established risk factors for stroke.

Stroke,1,9,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient Information:   Mr. John Browning is a 72-year-old African American male  currently residing in Baltimore  Maryland. He is a retired mechanical engineer  living with his wife of 40 years. He has two daughters  both residing out of state.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Browning came to the ER with symptoms of sudden weakness and numbness on his left side  including his face  arm  and leg. Complaints also included difficulty speaking  sudden confusion  severe headache without a known cause accompanied by vertigo  and issues with vision in one or both eyes. The family reports that the symptoms started abruptly approximately 3 hours prior to arrival.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Browning has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 5 years. He was a smoker  having quit 15 years ago  and reports moderate alcohol use. Mr. Browning's familial history shows that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 65. His mother died at old age  but reportedly had chronic hypertension as well.  Demographic Considerations:  It should be noted that Mr. Browning belongs to a demographic group - African American males above the age of 65 - that has a substantially higher risk of experiencing a stroke. This is mainly due to higher prevalence of hypertension  diabetes  and lifestyle choices such as smoking and alcohol consumption.  The socioeconomic factors involved in Mr. Browning's case could be contributing to his uncontrolled hypertension and could add to the risk of stroke. He lives in a city having healthcare disparity issues  which may have resulted in inadequate control of his hypertension and diabetes due to income-related barriers to medication adherence and access to regular healthcare.  In Conclusion:  Mr. Browning's case is a clear representation of the heightened risk of stroke amongst African American males of his age group. It emphasizes the importance of strategized healthcare plans to manage risk factors like hypertension and diabetes more effectively in this demographic. This aims to decrease the toll of stroke and its far-reaching repercussions on this vulnerable population.
Stroke,1,10,Title: Clinical Presentation of Stroke Patient  Name: Mrs. Louise Washington Age: 66 Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired schoolteacher Location: Harlem  New York City   Presenting Issue: Mrs. Washington was brought to the Emergency Department with right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking  which witnesses state occurred suddenly about two hours ago while she was watching television.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago and managed with medication (Lisinopril). - Non-insulin  diabetes type II  managed with Metformin and diet. - History of cigarette smoking (20 pack-years). - No previous history of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs). - Recent blood work  carried out about a month ago showed no abnormal results; A1C was well within managed range. - Her BMI suggests obesity (BMI = 32)  and she's tried various diets unsuccessfully in the past.  - She underwent a total knee replacement surgery three years ago due to severe osteoarthritis.  Family History: - Mrs. Washington’s mother had a stroke at the age of 74 and her father had a history of heart disease. - She has two siblings  one of which has hypertension while the other is healthy.  Social History: - She has quit smoking for about ten years  previously she used to smoke half a pack a day. - She has no history of alcohol or drug abuse. - Retired for the past 5 years  she lives with her daughter and is fairly active in her church group.  This presentation represents a demographic group (older-age African American women) that is commonly affected by stroke. Risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  past smoking  obesity  and family history can contribute to the heightened risk of stroke in this patient population  as supported by multiple health literature. It's crucial to understand these factors to achieve timely and effective stroke interventions for improved patient outcomes.  Conclusion: Evaluating and treating Mrs. Washington promptly will significantly increase her chances of not only surviving but also reducing disabling effects  which can severely affect her quality of life. As such  her case underscores the importance of rapid assessment and intervention in cases of suspected strokes.
Stroke,1,11,Title: Case Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith who resides in San Francisco  California. He is retired and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker and an occasional drinker. There is a relevant family history of cardiovascular disease.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented himself to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurring of speech  which started approximately two hours prior to his arrival at the hospital.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medication for both conditions for the past 10 years  including hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and rosuvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Moreover  he was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which is currently managed with Metformin. Mr. Smith also underwent an angioplasty for coronary artery disease three years ago.   At the presentation  Mr. Smith scored 12 on the NIH stroke scale. His blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  pulse 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 95%. His blood glucose was also elevated at 180 mg/dL; the ECG revealed no acute changes.   This case presentation of Mr. Smith portrays a typical stroke patient who is above 60 years of age  male  Caucasian  with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and heart disease  conditions that are known risk factors for stroke. Stroke is more common in men than women  and this risk increases with age and family history of cardiovascular disease. According to literature  African Americans and Latinos have a higher risk of stroke compared to Caucasians; however  Mr. Smith’s case falls under the Caucasian statistical group. Mr. Smith's modifiable risk factors include hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  hence proper management of these conditions is crucial in the prevention of subsequent stroke events.
Stroke,1,12,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old African-American male who has presented to our emergency department with signs and symptoms indicating a stroke. He was brought in by his wife after she noticed sudden weakness on the left side of his body  difficulty speaking  and balance problems. These symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago while they were having breakfast.  Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. He is a lifelong resident of Baltimore  Maryland. He has a 30-year history of high blood pressure  for which he takes Hydrochlorothiazide. However  he has been inconsistent with his medication due to lack of health coverage until recently. He is a non-smoker but has a history of heavy alcohol use in his younger years. Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago and controls his conditions with medication (Metformin) and a controlled diet. His diabetic control has been suboptimal  and his last recorded HbA1c was 8.6%. He has no known allergies.  There is a family history of cerebrovascular diseases - his father passed away from a stroke in his late eighties. His sister  who is 69 years old and has Type 2 Diabetes  suffered a stroke last year.   Analysis of stroke demographics show that African-Americans have a significantly higher risk of stroke  with men aged 45-64 having the highest risk for a first stroke. Add to this Mr. Smith's hypertension  diabetes  and family history  his risk profile highly predisposes him to stroke.   Investigations are ongoing to characterize the type and source of his stroke. Initial management has been initiated according to acute stroke protocols  with attention to preserve brain function  prevent complications  and using treatment options such as thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy when appropriate. An accurate assessment of his medical risk factors and rigorous control of these same risk factors will be vital to prevent recurrent stroke. He will also need ongoing multidisciplinary support to manage potential disabilities that might arise from the stroke.   In conclusion  Mr. John Smith’s stroke is a reminder of the disproportionate burden of stroke morbidity and mortality borne by the African-American community. Therefore  aggressive stroke prevention strategies are important to address this health disparity.
Stroke,1,13,Title: Patient Case Presentation: Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)  I. Introduction: The patient is Mr. Benjamin Thompson  a 68-year-old African American male from Baltimore  Maryland. He is currently retired and lives with his wife.  II. Demographics: Racially  African Americans have a higher risk of stroke compared to other racial and ethnic groups. In terms of age  individuals above 60 years make up the majority of stroke victims  thus putting Mr. Thompson within the high-risk demographic.   III. Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thompson presented with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  which occurred while watching television at home.  IV. Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago. These two conditions are his primary risk factors for stroke. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia. He used to smoke 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but quit smoking 15 years ago. He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  V. Examination Findings: On examination  he was alert but had expressive and receptive aphasia with right-sided facial droop. He demonstrated right upper and lower extremity hemiparesis. His blood pressure was elevated at 170/95 mmHg and blood sugar was also raised.  Considering the high prevalence of strokes in hypertensive  diabetic individuals above the age of 60 and in black men  the epidemiology of our patient aligns with current medical literature. His history of smoking significantly increases his risk of stroke  even though he ceased this habit 15 years ago.  Mr. Thompson’s case underscores the critical need for rigorous control of blood pressure and blood glucose levels  cessation of smoking  and management of cholesterol levels in patients at a high risk of stroke.   The above details emphasize the importance of early identification of stroke symptoms which include sudden onset of hemiparesis  facial drooping  speech difficulty  confusion  impaired balance  and severe headache. This can enable prompt medical intervention which can significantly mitigate the effects of stroke in such individuals.
Stroke,1,14,Title: A Case Presentation on Stroke   Patient Profile: Mr. T.  a 68-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department of our healthcare facility with signs of a possible acute stroke. The patient is currently living in Brooklyn  New York with his wife. He is a retired high school teacher and a veteran of the Vietnam War. He is a non-smoker  non-drinker  and claims to maintain a regular walking routine. The patient reported his adherence to a balanced diet but has an admitted predilection for salty foods. His family history reveals that his father died of stroke at the age of 72 and his mother had diabetes and hypertension.   Past Medical History: Mr. T was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 12 years ago  and has been under medication for both conditions. He has shown occasional instances of non-compliance with his prescribed medication regime. 3 years ago  he was diagnosed with type II diabetes and has been managing it through a combination of diet  exercise  and oral hypoglycemic agents.   Presenting Symptoms: On presentation  Mr. T demonstrated expressive aphasia  right side weakness  and facial drooping. He is alert and orientated to person  but not time and place. His wife reported that he had sudden onset of these symptoms approximately 1 hour ago while they were having breakfast  at which point she immediately called for an ambulance.   Based upon Mr. T's age  ethnicity  gender  utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  non-compliance with medications  family history of stroke and diabetes along with a sudden onset of neurological symptoms  his presenting signs point towards an acute ischemic stroke. However  further diagnostic confirmation including CT scans and blood tests need to be conducted. Immediate medical care is necessary to improve prognosis.  Social history: Mr. T is married with three children  all of whom are adults living independently. He is a Presbyterian and is actively involved in community service through his local church. He enjoys reading and gardening as recreational activities.
Stroke,1,15,Title: Case Presentation on a Stroke Patient  Subject: Mr. Alan Thompson  Background: Mr. Alan Thompson is a 68-year-old African American male  residing in East Harlem  New York City. He has been married for 42 years and he recently retired as a high school science teacher. He is a nonsmoker but did use alcohol moderately. His parents are both deceased; his mother had diabetes and suffered a stroke at 75  and his father passed away from colon cancer in his late 70s. Mr. Thompson is obese with a BMI of 33 and has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Concern: Mr. Thompson presented to our Emergency Department with onset of sudden weakness on the right side of the body  difficulty speaking  and a slight droop on the right side of his face. These symptoms started approximately 3 hours prior to arrival. He also reported difficulty walking and maintaining balance. He denies any headache  dizziness  loss of consciousness  or seizure. Mr. Thompson also denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.   Clinical and Examination Findings: On examination  Mr. Thompson is alert and oriented to time  person  and place  but displays evidence of expressive aphasia. His speech is slurred  and he exhibits right-sided facial droop. He demonstrates significant weakness on his right side  rating 3/5 on the muscle strength scale. His respiration rate and heart rate are notably stable. However  his blood pressure is elevated  reading 160/90 mm Hg  above his usual range. Pupils are briskly reactive to light and equal in size.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An immediate CT scan of his brain was performed  revealing an acute ischemic stroke on the left side of his brain. Given the patient’s time of symptom onset  he falls within the window for intravenous thrombolysis  which is the recommended treatment option for him.   This case reflects the demographic representation as per literature  which suggests that stroke is more common in adults over the age of 60  particularly in African American males. Risk factors include hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  and a family history of stroke.   In summary  Mr. Thompson is recommended to receive immediate intravenous thrombolysis and will necessitate primary stroke prevention measures  including better blood pressure and cholesterol control. Further  it will be advised to incorporate lifestyle modifications such as diet  reduction in alcohol use  and exercise regimen for weight loss.
Stroke,1,16,Title: Presentation of Stroke Patient  Introduction: Today  I'd like to present the case of a 72-year-old African American female  Mrs. Jackson  who presented to our facility with symptoms consistent with an acute ischemic stroke. About one month ago  Mrs. Jackson moved from her hometown in Detroit  Michigan  to live closer to her daughter's family in Los Angeles  California. This demographic information is notable given that research suggests African Americans  particularly in the older age group  are at higher risk of stroke than their white counterparts.  History of Present Illness: Mrs. Jackson was brought in by her daughter and son-in-law when they observed her developing slurred speech  sudden weakness on her right side  and distortion of her facial features. These symptoms started abruptly while she was having breakfast and had persisted for about 3 hours before the presentation. She denies experiencing any chest pain  nausea  or headache prior to the onset of these symptoms.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Jackson's past medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  common conditions associated with increased risk of stroke. She also has hyperlipidemia. She had been managing these conditions with oral antihypertensive  metformin  and statins that were prescribed by her former physician back in Detroit. She has no known allergies. Mrs. Jackson has no history of smoking but admits to excessive alcohol consumption in her younger years. There is a family history of heart disease  with both parents having had myocardial infarctions in their later years.   Social History: Mrs. Jackson is a widow and retired as a school principal. She has been living with her daughter's family. She denies active smoking or alcohol use. She has occasional help with activities of daily living but generally maintains relative independence.   Conclusion:  In this scenario  Mrs. Jackson's age  ethnicity  history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia all contribute to her risk of ischemic stroke. The best course of action in managing Mrs. Jackson's case is immediate intervention  followed by long-term modification of her risk factors  focusing on aggressive control of her hypertension and diabetes. Prompt rehabilitation  physiotherapy  and patient education will also play critical roles in her recovery and prevention of further strokes.
Stroke,1,17,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 69-year-old African American man  Mr. Jonathan Smith  a resident of Alabama who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided limb weakness and expressive dysphasia  consistent with an acute ischemic stroke. Mr. Smith is a retired carpenter  widower  and lives with his daughter and her family. He has a history of smoking but quit 20 years ago  though he consumes alcohol moderately.   Mr. Smith has a documented medical history of hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril  and Type 2 diabetes  which he manages with Metformin. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation three years ago and prescribed Warfarin for anticoagulation. However  he tends to miss doses due to poor adherence due to his reported difficulty in managing multiple medications.  His family history reveals his father suffered a fatal stroke at the age of 72. His mother passed away due to heart disease in her 70s  and his elder brother has a history of heart attacks and currently lives with heart failure. His 5-year survival following his first stroke is averagely 40%.  Mr. Smith's demographic characteristics are in line with typical stroke patients  as the incidence of stroke is highest in the 70-79 year age group  more common in men  and higher in African American individuals than Caucasians. His risk factors  including male gender  African American race  hypertension  diabetes  atrial fibrillation  smoking history  alcohol use  noncompliance with medication  and family history of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases  are widely recognized in literature. 
Stroke,1,18,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient Presenting with Stroke  Patient Profile: Mr. Jack Thompson is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  married with three children  and lives in suburban Pennsylvania. He is primarily English speaking and relies on Medicare. Demographically  this is consistent with the fact that the incidence of stroke is higher among older adults  particularly among Caucasian and African American males.  Clinical Presentation:   Mr. Thompson was brought to the ED by his wife today after experiencing sudden weakness on the left side of his body  including his left arm and leg. She also noticed that he was having trouble speaking and understanding her  and his mouth was drooping on one side. He was unable to smile evenly and complained of a sudden  severe headache. These symptoms pointed towards a probable cerebrovascular accident.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 7 years ago. He is a former smoker and gave up smoking ten years ago with the occasional alcohol intake. His father had a history of stroke at the age of 72. Hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  smoking  family history  and alcohol consumption are known risk factors for stroke.   Current Medications:  He is currently on Metformin for diabetes  Amlodipine for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for cholesterol control  though he confesses he often forgets to take his medication.   Social History:  Mr. Thompson and his wife are grappling with the challenges of his retirement and some distress about their financial situation. She worries about his sedentary lifestyle since retirement and his resistance to dietary modifications.   This case highlights the importance of controlling vascular risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol  and their role in predisposing patients to stroke. It also illustrates social determinants of health like financial stress  access to healthcare  medication adherence and lifestyle modifications  along with genetic predispositions in managing chronic illnesses and preventing severe outcomes like stroke.
Stroke,1,19,Title: Case Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient Profile: Mrs. Teagan Martinez is a 72-year-old Hispanic female  born and raised in northern New Mexico. She is a retired elementary school teacher and currently resides with her husband in Albuquerque. Mrs. Martinez is an active member of the local community center and is highly engaged in social activities.  Medical History: Mrs. Martinez has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been controlled with medication. She is a non-smoker and occasionally indulges in alcohol during community get-togethers  roughly once biweekly. She does not have any allergies. Her family history is significant for stroke  with both her father and elder brother experiencing cerebral events in their 70s. Mrs. Martinez's medication regimen includes a daily dose of hydrochlorothiazide (25mg) for her hypertension and a statin (rosuvastatin 20mg) for her hyperlipidemia. In terms of her physical fitness  she typically walks at the local park for about 30-40 minutes per day.   Stroke Presentation: Upon presentation  Mrs. Martinez reports sudden onset of weakness on the right side of her body  difficulty speaking  and a drooping facial expression  symptoms which led her husband to promptly bring her to the hospital. These symptoms arose earlier in the day while she was teaching a pottery class at the community center. As per her husband  Mrs. Martinez was her usual self before the event occurred. Her vitals upon arrival are stable; however  a neurological examination reveals right-sided hemiparesis  facial droop  and dysarthria. A CT scan performed promptly suggests an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution  pointing to an ischemic stroke.  Conclusion: In conclusion  as a 72-year-old Hispanic female with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of stroke  Mrs. Martinez presents with an acute stroke  which is a leading cause of death and disability in older adults. Timely treatment and care are of utmost importance in such cases to minimize neurological damage and maximize recovery. It also underlines the need for optimal management of risk factors and patient education to prevent recurrent strokes.   References: American Heart Association (2019).

Stroke,1,20,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Daniels Age: 66 years old Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired teacher Residential Status: Lives alone in an urban setting Insurance: Medicare  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Daniels presented in the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech  weakness on the right side of his body  and difficulty understanding people around him.   Medical History:  Mr. Daniels has a known history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which he has been managing for the past 15 years. He also has a long-standing history of smoking  having been lighting up for the past 40 years  though markedly less in recent years. He has a family history of stroke  with his father having suffered one at the age of 72.  Lifestyle:  Mr. Daniels follows a moderately healthy diet but enjoys an occasional fast food binge. He has a sedentary lifestyle  with limited physical activity. He quit drinking alcohol five years ago.  Recent History:  Mr. Daniels woke up with symptoms  which points to the possibility of a stroke occurring during sleep (wake-up stroke).   Evaluation:  On examination  Mr. Daniels showed signs of severe expressive aphasia and right-sided weakness: suggesting a left hemisphere cerebrovascular event. A non-contrast CT scan was urgently ordered to confirm the diagnosis.  This case is representative of the demographics often seen in stroke patients. Numerous studies have shown that stroke is more common in older adults  particularly those over the age of 65. In addition  African Americans have nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with Caucasians  and they have a much higher death rate from stroke. Hypertension  smoking  hypercholesterolemia  and a sedentary lifestyle are known risk factors for stroke.   The presence of these risk factors necessitates the immediate attention of the medical team towards swift diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management to improve patient outcomes. 
Stroke,1,21,Title: Stroke Patient Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Thompson Age: 67 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Presenting Complaint (Chief Complaint):  Mr. Thompson was brought in by his son who reported that his father complained about a sudden  severe headache  disturbance in speech  and numbness on the left side of his body. The symptoms started about two hours prior to presentation.  Medical History:  Mr. Thompson is a known hypertensive for the past ten years. He is also a patient with type II diabetes mellitus that is reasonably controlled with a combination of metformin and gliptins. His BMI falls under overweight category. Mr. Thompson has a smoking history of 20 pack years  and he consumes alcohol socially.   Family History:  His father had a stroke in his seventies and died due to complications associated with it.  Demographics and Risk Factors:  Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  with a higher prevalence among the older population  particularly those aged 65 years and above. Race and ethnicity are significant risk factors  with African-Americans having a much higher risk of stroke compared to white populations. Modifiable risk factors include hypertension  smoking  diabetes  and obesity  all of which are evident in Mr. Thompson's medical history.   Current Clinical Condition: On examination  Mr. Thompson was conscious but seemed confused. His blood pressure was elevated at 170/90 mm Hg. He had slurred speech and showed signs of left-sided weakness  indicating a likely right hemisphere brain injury. His blood glucose was slightly elevated at 165 mg/dL  but within acceptable range considering his stress condition.  Impression: After a thorough history taking  clinical examination  and observations  the patient is diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. As the next step  a CT scan or MRI of his brain will be arranged to confirm the diagnosis and the cause of the stroke.  Plan:  Immediately start the patient on aspirin therapy and manage hypertension. Once imaging studies confirm the diagnosis  thrombolysis or thrombectomy may be considered depending on the image findings  provided the patient falls under the window period for stroke intervention. Diet and lifestyle modification advice will be given to control his diabetes  hypertension and weight. Further attempts will also be made to help Mr. Thompson quit smoking.

Stroke,1,24,Title: Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Demographic Information:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith. He is an English-speaking retired school teacher  married with two adult children. He resides in an urban area with his spouse  a 65-year-old retired nurse. Mr. Smith's Body Mass Index (BMI) is 28  he has moderate alcohol intake and is an ex-smoker.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which was diagnosed at the age of 50. He has been managing it with a combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide  together with lifestyle modifications including dietary control and daily exercise. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia managed with Atorvastatin. However  his compliance with the medication is irregular. His other health issue is Type 2 diabetes  diagnosed five years ago  which has been well controlled using Metformin. His last HbA1c level  taken 3 months ago  was 7%. He has no known allergies but has a familial history of stroke; his father experienced a stroke in his early 70s. It is notable to mention that he has no known symptom of transient ischemic attack or stroke previously.   Presentation:  Mr. Smith was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after his wife found him unable to speak properly and having weakness on his right side. This occurred approximately one hour prior to his arrival at the hospital. The patient did not complain of headache or display symptoms suggesting a seizure before the weakness onset. There was no reported trauma.  This demographic information and past medical history suggest Mr. Smith is at a higher risk for a stroke due to his advanced age  hypertension  history of high cholesterol  Type 2 diabetes  familial history of stroke  and relatively high BMI.   The demographic data presented correspond to literature data  which identifies older age  male gender  Caucasian race  and history of hypertension  cholesterol  and diabetes as common risk factors for stroke. According to demographic representation studies  urban dwellers also have a higher risk compared to rural dwellers.
Stroke,1,25,Title: Presentation of a Patient Presenting with Stroke  Patricia Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  presents with initial symptoms of a potential stroke. According to national data  stroke incidence in Hispanic individuals is significantly high and is particularly heightened beyond the age of 55.   Living in Tampa  Florida  a state with a greater prevalence of stroke due to its high population of elderly individuals  Patricia is retired and lives with her husband. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes; both high-risk factors for stroke. She does not smoke  indicating one fewer risk factor.   Patricia has been experiencing episodes of sudden numbness and weakness on the left side of her body  particularly affecting her face  arm  and leg. She reports difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  problems with balance and coordination  and a severe headache that started abruptly.   Patricia's husband notes that she has seemed confused and has had trouble with her vision over the past 24 hours. He is unsure whether this has been a gradual occurrence or if it's newly developed.   Patricia has not experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack before  making this her first incidence. Due to her age  race  underlying conditions  and current residence  she falls into a high-risk category for ischemic stroke. Patricia's case illustrates how demographic data and medical history can potentially influence stroke risk.   Proper identification of her symptoms and immediate action towards medical help is crucial  as stroke is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. Early intervention could potentially lower the long-term impact and enhance her recovery odds.   References:  1. American Heart Association: Facts About Hypertension 2.

Stroke,1,26,Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient Information Our patient  Mr. Joseph Martinez  is a 72-year-old African-American male currently residing in Oakland  California. Mr. Martinez is retired and lives independently with his wife of 40 years. He has two children and four grandchildren living nearby.   Present Conditions Mr. Martinez presents with symptoms consistent with a stroke. These occurred suddenly and include right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  severe headache  and blurred vision. He was brought immediately to the Emergency Department by his wife upon onset of these symptoms.  Past Medical History Mr. Martinez’s past medical history is significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia - all conditions well-established as risk factors for stroke. His medication history includes Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. His records also indicate that he has a 30-year history of smoking although he quit a decade ago. He has moderate alcohol consumption patterns and his BMI falls within the overweight category.   Family History Medically significant familial history includes a father who succumbed to stroke at the age of 67  and a mother who passed away from heart complications at the age of 76.  According to the American Stroke Association  stroke risk increases with age  especially after 65  and African-Americans are disproportionately affected due to heightened rates of hypertension and diabetes - both of which Mr. Martinez has. His current symptoms and past medical history align with a high-risk profile for stroke. Furthermore  evidence suggests that men are more likely than women to suffer strokes at a younger age  further underscoring the severity of Mr. Martinez's current predicament.  In conclusion  Mr. Martinez’s demographic and medical history  make him representative of many older African-American males in the United States  who face increased risk of stroke due to a combination of genetic factors and underlying medical conditions. This case highlights the importance of early detection  risk management  and continual monitoring of conditions predisposing to stroke in similar demographic groups. 
Stroke,1,27,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe headache  confusion  difficulty speaking  and right-sided weakness. The symptoms began about 2 hours prior to presentation.   Mr. Smith is a retired factory worker who lives with his wife in a suburban community. He is generally in good health and maintains an active lifestyle. He doesn’t smoke  and his alcohol consumption is moderate. He adheres to a balanced diet and engages in regular physical activity such as walking and golfing.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  which he has been managing for 10 years with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. There is no history of previous stroke or transient ischemic attacks in his health record.   Family history reveals paternal grandfather had suffered from a stroke in his late 60s. No other significant family history information is provided. Prior to experiencing his current symptoms  he was fully functional and independent with his activities of daily living (ADLs).   In summary  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of an acute cerebrovascular event. His risk factors for stroke include his age  male gender  race  hypertensive status  and a family history of stroke.  That concludes the presentation for Mr. Smith. Any further information from his neurological examination  lab results  and imaging studies will be useful in confirming our suspected diagnosis and guiding our treatment and management plan.
Stroke,1,28,"Patient Presentation:  We are presenting a case of a 72 year old African-American female  Mrs. X  who has been brought to the emergency room for a suspected stroke. As per data  African-Americans have a relatively higher risk of stroke than other ethnic groups. In the United States  stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death  being comparatively more prevalent in the elderly population  which underlies the demographic representation of our patient.   History & Background:  Mrs. X is a widow who lives alone  although she has regular home visits from a community nurse and her occasional caregiver. She has been taking medications for her chronic illnesses  including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. Suboptimal control of these diseases often increases the risk of cerebrovascular accidents such as strokes.   Chief Complaint:  The patient presented dizziness  sudden onset weakness on the right side of the body  slurred speech and """"blacked out"""" vision in the right eye  which happened around an hour ago. Interestingly  her medical record indicates a similar episode two years back  which she recovered from without lasting consequences.  Risk Factors:  In terms of risk factors  the patient is obese (BMI 32 kg/m2) and has a strong family history of stroke  with her father having suffered a fatal stroke at the age of 70. She is non-alcoholic and a non-smoker  but has a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet  mainly depending on processed and fast foods.   Lifestyle Factors:  Unfortunately  Mrs. X is not diligent about maintaining regular follow-up visits with her primary care provider. She admits to frequently forgetting to take her medications and says her physical activity is minimal due to lack of energy and mobility issues associated with overweight status.  Based on her history  demographics  and presentation of symptoms  it is imperative to initiate acute management for the suspected stroke. She has been stabilized in the ER and is scheduled for a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. Plans for future prevention of stroke will depend on the findings from the forthcoming investigations. Simultaneously  her chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes need better management along with combating obesity and improving overall lifestyle by implementing necessary changes in diet and exercise."
Stroke,1,29,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke – A Case Presentation  I. Introduction We present a case of a 65-year-old African-American male with an acute onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech.   II. Patient Demographics The patient  Mr. A  is a 65-year-old African American male  living in an urban neighborhood in the Midwest. He worked as a custodian before his retirement and lives with his wife and their dog.   According to the literature  stroke disproportionately affects African Americans and is the leading cause of disability among older adults. It is approximately twice as common in African Americans compared to whites  and stroke mortality is also significantly higher in this population.  III. Presenting Symptoms Mr. A was brought in by EMS after his wife noticed that he was having difficulties with speech and was unable to move his right arm and leg.   IV. Past Medical History Mr. A has a complex past medical history which includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes  chronic kidney disease  and a 10-year history of smoking. Unfortunately  due to socioeconomic barriers  Mr. A has had irregular access to healthcare  resulting in sub-optimal control of his blood pressure and blood sugars. Literature indicates that uncontrolled hypertension is one of the most significant risk factors for stroke and it is quite prevalent in the African American population due to genetic factors as well as socioeconomic disparities. The diabetes and smoking history add to the significant risk factor burden for stroke in Mr. A.  V. Conclusion We are dealing with an acute ischemic stroke in a patient with multiple pre-existing vascular risk factors  that could have contributed significantly to his present condition. It emphasizes the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors such as blood pressure control  glucose control  smoking cessation  and access to healthcare in preventing stroke  especially in high-risk populations like African Americans.
Stroke,1,30,Title: Stroke Patient Presentation  Introduction:  Today's patient is a 71-year-old African American male  named Mr. Thomas Greene  who presents with acute symptoms suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident or stroke. As we discuss Mr. Greene's case  it is noteworthy to mention that African Americans have a higher risk for stroke compared to other racial and ethnic groups.   Demographic Information:  Mr. Greene is a retired automotive mechanic  hailing from Detroit  Michigan. He is a widower living with his daughter and two grandchildren. He is a non-smoker but has a history of high alcohol consumption  which he has since moderated after a diagnosis of hypertension 7 years back.  Past Medical History:  His medical history is significant for certain stroke risk factors  including uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He had an episode of a transient ischemic attack about 3 years ago. There is no history of heart disease. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 28.2  indicating overweight status  potentially owing to his sedentary lifestyle and diet. His non-compliance with anti-hypertensives and blood sugar maintenance medications have been of concern for his primary doctor.  Presenting Complaints:  He presented to the emergency department this morning  with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurring of speech and facial droop lasting for about an hour. The family reports that he appeared normal during breakfast but started showing symptoms while watching television.  Summarization:  In summary  a 71-year-old African American male with a significant medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia presents with symptoms suggestive of stroke. Given his age  ethnicity  and past medical history  his stroke risk is heightened compared to the general population. His non-compliance with medication could be a contributing factor to his present condition.  Mr. Greene's case illustrates the importance of improved health education  regular follow-ups  and convincing the patient about adherence to treatment to prevent devastating vascular events like stroke.
Stroke,1,31,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Stroke  Patient Profile:  Name: Maria Smith Age: 66 years Ethnicity: Hispanic  Sex: Female Occupational Status: Retired Nurse   Presenting Problem: Patient presents with sudden onset of left-sided weakness  facial droop  and speech difficulty  highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith has had a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years. Both conditions are known risk factors for ischemic stroke. However  they are managed with medication and lifestyle modifications. She has never smoked  although she has consumed alcohol moderately over her adult life. She is physically active for her age  undertaking light exercise daily.  Recent History: She reported having experienced occasional mild headaches and fatigue a week before  but did not seek medical advice for these symptoms. She has been living alone post her husband’s demise three years ago and is usually visited by her children every alternate day.  Emergency Response: Due to the timely identification of the stroke symptoms  her daughter was able to call Emergency Medical Services promptly. The patient has been rushed to the hospital within 2 hours from the symptom onset  qualifying her for immediate medical intervention  potentially decreasing morbidity and mortality risk.  The patient's information provided in this presentation is consistent with literature  as women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke  and individuals of Hispanic ethnicity have a higher prevalence of stroke risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. Also  stroke symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in the face or limbs  especially on one side of the body  confusion  and difficulty speaking  indicate a need for urgent medical attention. Moreover  stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among older adults.   The quick action of the patient's family in recognizing symptoms and calling for medical assistance demonstrates the importance of education regarding stroke symptoms and response  and can immensely affect patient outcomes in the acute phase of a stroke.
Stroke,1,32,Slide 1: Introduction  Our patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He has been living in Baltimore  Maryland  for all his life. Mr. Johnson has been brought to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute ischemic stroke.   Slide 2: Sociodemographic Data  African American men tend to have a higher incidence of strokes compared to other racial and ethnic groups. The reason for this disparity is multifactorial  including socio-economic and genetic factors  as well as a higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  In the context of Mr. Johnson’s past medical history  he has been managing hypertension for the past ten years and type 2 diabetes for the last five years. Both conditions were under control with medications. He also had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years ago.  Slide 4: Current Presentation  Mr. Johnson was found by his wife at home with sudden onset left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. These symptoms began approximately two hours prior to arrival in the ER. Upon initial evaluation  his blood pressure was significantly elevated  and his blood glucose was within reasonable limits given his history of diabetes.  Slide 5: Integrating Demography and History  Considering Mr. Johnson’s age  race  history of hypertension  diabetes  and previous TIA  he is at a notably higher risk for stroke. This elevated risk necessitates an expedited investigation and the initiation of evidence-based acute stroke therapies.   Slide 6: Conclusion  In Mr. Johnson's case  his demographic profile and past medical history are crucial in understanding and managing his current presentation of symptoms. It highlights the importance of recognizing the socio-demographic disparities in health  especially related to stroke  and the need for tailored medical attention and healthcare planning. Investigations and management approach need to be decided urgently  considering his ongoing stroke.   References: Johnson  PA  et al. (2014).

Stroke,1,33,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Patient's Identifier: Mr. J. Armstead Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Will discuss the initial presentation  past medical history  and the different factors that might have contributed to the current medical condition.  Slide 2: Chief Complaint Presenting for sudden onset of left-side weakness  slurred speech  and facial droop  notable symptoms consistent to a potential stroke.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - History of hypertension (HTN)  poorly controlled as indicated by home blood pressure readings. - Moderate smoker for 40 years  approx 1 pack per day. - Rarely drinks alcohol  no more than 2 drinks per week. - No previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). - Family history of stroke (Mother). - Has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) with inadequate glycemic control. - Does not engage in regular physical exercise.  Slide 4: Social History  - Lives alone but close to his daughter and interacts with her daily. - Worked as a school custodian before retiring 6 years ago.  Slide 5: Environmental Factors  Resides in an urban area with limited access to healthy food choices and recreational areas for exercising.  Slide 6: Current Medication  - Lisinopril 20mg daily for HTN. - Metformin 1000mg twice a day for DM. - No other known medication.  Slide 7: Assessment  Mr. Armstead’s impaired mobility and perceived challenges to healthy lifestyle alterations may contribute to his poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes. Along with his smoking habit  these factors significantly increased his risk of stroke  as represented in his current presentation.  Slide 8: Literature Considerations  Research studies indicate that African American men are at higher risk of stroke  particularly in case of uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes as well as with lifestyle factors like smoking.  Slide 9: Conclusion and Recommendations  Mr. Armstead needs immediate medical attention due to his stroke symptoms. Post-stabilization  a lifestyle modification including healthy diet  regular exercise  smoking cessation  and tighter control of his hypertension and diabetes is recommended.
Stroke,1,34,Presentation:  The patient is a 78-year-old Caucasian male who comes in today with sudden onset of weakness in his right upper and lower extremities  slurred speech and blurry vision which started a few hours ago. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia.   Demographics:  According to the public health literature  our patient fits the common demographic profile for a stroke patient. Stroke is more common among old aged individuals  with the risk of stroke about doubling for each decade of life after age 55. While men  especially Caucasian men  have a higher risk of stroke  it's also noteworthy to mention that women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke because they usually live longer than men.   Past Medical History:   Our patient's history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia also aligns with the literature indicating these as major risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure) can undermine the walls of blood vessels  making them weak and more likely to rupture or clog  leading to a stroke. Similarly  poorly controlled diabetes affects the blood vessels throughout the body  predisposing to stroke. Elevated lipid levels  too  contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques  thereby leading to increased risk of intracranial blockage (stroke).   To summarize  the characteristics of our patient  concerning his age  gender  ethnicity  and past diseases  point towards a high risk for stroke  and thus his current presentation is consistent with the same. It's an imperative situation to immediately perform necessary stroke workups and start appropriate treatment to avoid any potential complications.
Stroke,1,35,Title: Patient Presentation: A Case of Stroke  I. Demographic Information   Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male named Mr. James. He is a retired construction worker and currently resides in Chicago with his wife. He neither smokes nor consumes alcohol. Mr. James adheres to a high-sodium diet and has a sedentary lifestyle.  II. Past Medical History  Mr. James was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 45 and type 2 diabetes mellitus when he was 56. He has been on medication for both but his adherence to his prescription regime is only partially satisfactory  mainly due to a lack of understanding about the importance of regular medication. Moreover  despite regular follow-ups  his blood pressure levels and blood glucose levels have never been optimally controlled. He also had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) three years ago.   III. Current Presentation  Mr. James presented at the emergency room with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurring of speech which persisted for a couple of hours. His wife confirmed that he had not experienced any head injury. Other symptoms reported were dizziness and mild headache.   This presentation is consistent with the data from literature which shows that stroke is common in individuals with hypertension and diabetes  and men are more likely to have strokes than women. African Americans are reportedly at a greater risk of stroke than their white counterparts. Moreover  the median age of a stroke patient is often reported around the mid-sixties.   In conclusion  Mr. James' presented symptoms as well as his age  race  and past medical history  make his case a typical representation of stroke in demographic literature. His case emphasizes the importance of adequate control of hypertension and diabetes  the major risk factors for stroke  and offers learning on the relationship of demographic factors and stroke occurrence.

She also noticed drooling from the right side of her mouth. Her husband immediately called the Emergency Medical Services who identified the signs of a possible stroke.   Slide 7 - Notable   Data shows that the Hispanic population has a slightly higher risk of stroke compared to non-Hispanic whites  and women are more likely to have a stroke than their male counterparts. The combination of Rosa's sex  ethnicity  and her pre-existing medical conditions places her in higher risk for a stroke.  Slide 8 - Conclusion   This case reflects the importance of understanding the intersection of demographic risks  lifestyle choices  and medical history in the management of patients who present with stroke symptoms. 
Stroke,1,37,Title: Presentation of an Afro-American Male Patient with Stroke  Introduction: Mr. L  a 72-year-old Afro-American retired engineer  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking  starting approximately 1.5 hours ago. The patient resides in an urban setting in Dallas with his wife and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. L has been hypertensive for the past fifteen years but his condition is poorly controlled due to inconsistent medication compliance. His other comorbidities include type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin and insulin  and hyperlipidemia treated with Atorvastatin. There is also a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father having died from myocardial infarction  and his elder brother having survived a previous stroke.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. L's wife immediately noticed his changed physical state  including slurred speech  drooping on the left side of his face  and his inability to move his left arm and leg. There were also additional symptoms like a sudden severe headache and dizziness. Mr. L denied any chest pain  shortness of breath or changes in eyesight.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. L's blood pressure read 180/110 mmHg  demonstrating hypertensive urgency. His pulse was regular with a rate of 92 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and he had an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His ECG revealed no signs of acute ischemia or old infarction. Auscultation of his chest was clear. The neurological assessment revealed significant left-sided hemiparesis and mild dysarthria  but no perception of pain or temperature change was acknowledged on his left side.  Evaluation: Mr. L's symptoms are suggestive of a right cerebral hemisphere stroke. Given the recent onset of symptoms  he is within the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy. There is an urgent need for a non-contrast CT scan of his brain to confirm and exclude hemorrhagic stroke  along with blood tests for complete blood count  serum glucose  and coagulation profile.  Summary: This case highlights a typical presentation of ischaemic stroke in an Afro-American elderly male with multiple risk factors. Primary prevention through better management of his hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia could potentially have delayed or even prevented this life-threatening event. Therefore  this scenario emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modifications and medication adherence for prevention of major cardiovascular events in at-risk populations.
Stroke,1,38,Slide 1:  Title: Case Presentation - Patient Presenting with Stroke  Slide 2: Title: Demographics and Past Medical History Content:  Mr. Joseph is a 68-year-old African American male who is non-Hispanic. His native language is English. He is a retiree and a widower with two adult children. Literature reports that African American men are at higher risk for stroke due to various risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and lifestyle habits.  Slide 3: Title: Past Medical History Content: Mr. Joseph has a past medical history suggestive of stroke risk factors. He is hypertensive and has type 2 diabetes  both conditions poorly managed due to the patient's non-adherence. He is a former smoker  and has high cholesterol. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation two years ago  but medication adherence is poor. He also has a family history of stroke with his father having a fatal stroke at the age of 70.  Slide 4: Title: Current Presentation Content:  Mr. Joseph presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of slurred speech  right-sided weakness  and difficulty walking  which started roughly two hours ago while he was watching television at home. A neighbour found him when he did not answer the phone and rushed him to the hospital.  Slide 5: Title: Physical Examination and Screening Content:  On physical examination  Mr. Joseph is alert but displays clear signs of aphasia. He has right-sided facial droop  hemiparesis on the right side  and decreased sensation to light touch on the right side of his body  indicative of a possible left hemisphere stroke. His NIH Stroke Scale score at presentation is 12.  Slide 6: Title: Investigation and Treatment Content:  Immediate CT scans reveal a large ischemic stroke located in the left hemisphere. A 12-lead EKG confirms a pattern consistent with atrial fibrillation. Since it is within the 4.5-hour window after symptom onset  he is considered for thrombolytic therapy after necessary exclusions.  Slide 7: Title: Plan Content: Following treatment for acute stroke  Mr Joseph will require further management for his risk factors including better control of his diabetes and blood pressure. As Mr Joseph lives alone  he will need support from community and family for his rehabilitation. Considerations for future will also include stroke prevention strategies and lifestyle modification counselling.     Slide 8: Title: Case Conclusion Content: This case illustrates the heightened risk of stroke in patients with unmanaged hypertension  diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Early identification and improved management of these risk factors can provide better health outcomes.

Stroke,1,43,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Juan Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents today with clear signs of stroke. Mr. Rodriguez was at home with his wife when he began experiencing sudden weakness in his right hand and leg  difficulty talking  facial droop  and a severe headache came on abruptly. The symptoms manifested approximately three hours ago  and his wife  recognizing these as stroke symptoms  called the emergency services immediately.  Demographics:   Mr. Rodriguez is a native of Puerto Rico and moved to the United States in his early 30s. He is retired from his job as a construction worker and is currently living with his wife in Miami  Florida. He is a non-smoker  but he consumed alcohol socially before his retirement.   Past Medical History:   Relative to his medical history  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes roughly ten years ago  both of which have been managed with medication. Despite being on both hypertensive and diabetic medication  his compliance has been inconsistent  and he has had flashes of uncontrolled blood pressure and blood glucose. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago. There is no known history of stroke in his immediate family  but his father had a heart disease.   According to stroke statistics  African Americans  Hispanics  American Indians  and Alaska Natives carry a higher risk of getting a stroke than white individuals. Men are also more prone to strokes compared to women. Older individuals  especially those above 55  are at a higher risk  with the risk doubling every ten years after turning 55.  Risks related to Mr. Rodriguez’s stroke include the combination of his older age  Hispanic ethnicity  male gender  and his past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes.  There is an ongoing urgency to administer acute stroke therapy ASAP  provided there are no contraindications to such treatment. Subsequently  secondary treatment to prevent stroke recurrence is a medical priority.
Stroke,1,44,Subject: Presentation of Stroke Patient  Good morning everyone   Today  I am presenting the case of a 65-year-old African American female patient  a demographic group which  according to available literature  exhibits a relatively higher risk of ischemic stroke. The patient  Mrs. Anna Thompson  came in late last night following complaints of sudden onset of numbness and weakness on her right side  specifically in the arm and face. Concurrent symptoms also reported by her husband include confusion  difficulty in speaking  sudden severe headache and problems with walking  indicative of impaired coordination.  Mrs. Thompson is a long-term resident of Georgia  living with her husband and managing her small retail business. She is a nonsmoker but has a notable history of hypertension  which she has managed for over a decade. Her blood pressure upon presentation was significantly elevated at 175/98 mmHg.  In her medical history  Mrs. Thompson was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  and she also has a family history of strokes. Her father had suffered a stroke when he was around her age. She also had high cholesterol diagnosed three years ago and takes statins irregularly.   She has no known allergies and typically follows a regular medication regimen including Metformin for her diabetes and Lisinopril for her hypertension  but adherence may sometimes waver due to the stress from her demanding business.   The sudden onset of symptoms and her medical history suggests the likelihood of an ischemic stroke. We advised for immediate clinical investigations  including a full blood count  glucose  cholesterol  and clotting tests and brain imaging for accurate diagnosis and to determine the possible cause and location of the stroke.   Please continue to monitor Mrs. Thompson's condition and maintain open communication with her and her family about the test results and proposed treatment plan. Remember that in managing such cases  timing is imperative. Our goal is to minimize damage  optimize recovery  and prevent recurrent attacks.   Thank you.
Stroke,1,45,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson  who presents with symptoms indicative of a stroke. His chief complaints include sudden onset of left-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty understanding others. These symptoms started approximately two hours prior  while he was having breakfast. He denies experiencing any headache  blurring of vision  loss of consciousness  or recent trauma but reports a recent history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or """"mini-strokes.""""  His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack year smoking history. Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with type II diabetes 15 years ago and takes oral medications. He denies any significant surgical history. He lives alone and is retired but does physical activities like walking his dog and gardening. His mother also had a stroke  and his father had coronary artery disease.  Mr. Johnson's current medications include hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension  metformin for his diabetes  and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He does not take any blood thinners. He is allergic to penicillin which had caused him to experience hives in the past.  Upon examination  the patient's right side is normal  but there is obvious weakness on his left upper and lower extremities  and his left side of the face appears droopy. He has dysarthria  poor articulation of speech; additionally  he seems fatigued and is having difficulty understanding our questions.  Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in older adults and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 800 000 people suffer from a stroke each year  and 75% of which occurs in people over 65 years. Whites are at higher risk compared to Hispanics and African Americans  and males are at slightly higher risk than females. Differential diagnoses for patients presenting with such symptoms might include a TIA  brain tumor  or brain abscess. However  given Mr. Johnson's clinical presentation  medical history  current medication regimen  and family history  an ischemic stroke is the likely diagnosis.  We recommend immediate hospitalization for further evaluation  close monitoring and immediate medical intervention  including potential thrombolytic therapy given the time frame since symptom onset  to prevent further neuronal damage  associated morbidity  and long-term disability.

Stroke,1,46,Title: Case Presentation for a Patient Presenting with Stroke  Introduction:  The patient  Mr. John Binge  is a 65-year-old African American male  retired teacher  living in south side Chicago  who presented with sudden onset of left-sided weakness  dysarthria  and facial droop noticed upon waking from sleep. Notably  the stroke incidence in the US is highest among African Americans. The patient was brought to the Emergency Department by his daughter who resides with him.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Binge has a confirmed history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years  Type 2 diabetes mellitus for five years  and is also diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage-3  all of which are known risk factors for stroke. Commendably  he is a non-smoker and has abstained from alcohol for the past 15 years. However  there has been noncompliance with the recommended dietary restrictions and prescribed medications such as ACE inhibitors and metformin which the patient mentioned due to forgetfulness and unavailability of the medications in nearby pharmacies.  Family History:   The patient's father died from a heart attack at the age of 68  and his mother died of a stroke at the age of 70. Two of his older siblings are alive and diagnosed with various cardiovascular diseases.  Social History:  Mr. Binge is widowed and currently lives with his only daughter who takes care of him. He has a supportive community but has expressed difficulty in managing his health due to his limited income as a retiree and occasional forgetfulness.  Summary:  In conclusion  given his demographic background  past medical history  and sudden onset of left-sided weakness  dysarthria  and facial drooping  Mr. Binge is likely to be experiencing an ischemic stroke. The patient's long-standing  uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes make him particularly prone to cerebrovascular events. Noncompliance with his prescribed medications further exacerbates the risk. A prompt assessment using neuroimaging and a thorough neurological evaluation are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and initiate timely treatment.
Stroke,1,47,"Presentation:  """"Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening   Today we will be discussing the case of Mr. James Morton  a 75-year-old Caucasian male. Mr. Morton is a retired school principal who lives in a rural community in South Carolina. He lives with his wife and he is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. He has been under ongoing treatment for type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last 15 years and also has been diagnosed with Hypertension for ten years which he self-manages via medication effectively. In addition  he has a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for six years but no known history of atrial fibrillation nor any type of heart disease. He has a family history of stroke with his father experiencing a stroke at the age of 80.  Two days ago  Mr. Morton was brought to the ER after he complained of sudden numbness on the left side of his body  slurred speech  and loss of balance. A predilection towards stroke was suspected given the symptoms. Further examination  monitoring  and necessary tests are being conducted now to understand the type and extent of the stroke.   The demographic representation of Mr. Morton is significant as Caucasians and those in advancing years carry higher risks of stroke  with risk doubling every decade after the age of 55. In addition  the South-Eastern 'Stroke Belt' of the United States has the highest rate of stroke mortality  which also correlates with Mr. Morton's residential location. His history of diabetes  hypertension  and COPD further escalate his risk for stroke.   Going forward  the priority will be immediate stroke care and management followed by comprehensive rehabilitation and secondary preventative measures implementing lifestyle modulations  monitoring  and controlling of blood pressures  diabetes  and other potent risk factors.  Emphasis will also be given to smoking cessation programs and consultations  if relevant  for any other patients presenting similar history or symptoms.""""  The above presentation has used a fictitious character created as an illustration of a typical stroke patient in the United States. The risk factors and demographics cited are based on epidemiological stroke studies and WHO reports. The proposed treatment and management plans reflect standard stroke care protocols  which will vary from patient to patient based on their individual assessment.   Thank you for your attention.  "
Stroke,1,48,Title: Diagnosing Stroke: A Case Presentation  Introduction:  Our patient  Mr. Ray Caldwell  is a 68-year-old African American male  presenting with symptoms of a possible stroke. Mr. Caldwell is a retired school teacher  currently living in Washington DC  with his spouse. He has been living a sedentary lifestyle ever since he retired from his teaching job and is a known smoker  with about a 25-year smoking history.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Caldwell had been diagnosed and actively treated for hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels. Nevertheless  he mentions some non-compliance with his medication for diabetes and hypertension due to financial constraints and side effects  respectively.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Caldwell presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided numbness in his arm and leg  slurred speech and a drooping left side of his face  which began about an hour prior to his visit. He also complained of a sudden throbbing headache. The patient’s wife reported that he never experienced these symptoms before and had no trauma or recent injury.   Demographics vs. Stroke risk:  Literature suggests that African American males have a higher incidence of stroke compared to their White counterparts  with incidence peaking around the ages of 65 to 74. Moreover  the possibility of stroke is amplified by the presence of comorbid conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol levels  which Mr. Caldwell is already diagnosed with. His habit of smoking is yet another risk factor. Additionally  research shows higher case fatality rates due to stroke in individuals who are non-compliant with their medication.  Conclusion:  Mr. Caldwell fits the typical demographic and clinical profile of patients more likely to experience a stroke event. Due to his presenting symptoms and with his specific demographic and medical background  it is critical to initiate an immediate diagnostic workup for stroke for prompt management to decrease morbidity and mortality.   It is important to note that this case emphasizes the need for better patient education and improved health practices for individuals that fall into high-risk categories  like Mr. Caldwell. It also highlights the importance of better understanding and addressing specific stroke risk factors among different racial and ethnic populations.
Stroke,1,49,Title: An Atypical Case - The Silent Stroke  Patient Information: Ms. Anna Smith  a 74-year-old African American female  engineer by profession  retired  now living with her eldest daughter.  Presenting Issue: Ms. Smith presents with sudden onset of weakness and numbness in her right arm  difficulty speaking  unsteadiness  dizziness  and confusion. She also reports a severe headache that started abruptly. These symptoms started a couple of hours ago.  Medical Background: Ms. Smith has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes for the past 8 years. She is currently on antihypertensive medication (Enalapril) and oral diabetes medication (Metformin). Her hypertension and blood glucose levels are well-controlled. She was previously an active smoker for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. She has no prior history of stroke or heart disease. There is no significant family history of stroke  cardiovascular disease  or diabetes.  Exposure Risk: As an African American woman over 65  she belongs to a population segment with higher prevalence of stroke. Her history of hypertension and diabetes are also contributing factors to her higher risk profile.  Social History: Lives with her daughter  is mostly independent with her activities of daily living  but requires assistance with transportation to medical appointments. She consumes alcohol occasionally in social settings and has a well-balanced diet.  Physical Examination: On examination  signs of right-sided weakness and XI nerve palsy are noted. Her vitals are stable  except for her blood pressure which is slightly elevated at 142/90 mmHg. She demonstrates some difficulty comprehending and following complex instructions.  Diagnostic Assessment: Based on the presenting symptoms and history  a potential ischemic stroke is suspected. Further diagnostic testing  including neurological imaging (via CT or MRI)  has been recommended to confirm diagnosis and identify the exact location and extent of the damage.  Treatment/Next Steps: Immediate consultation with a neurologist has been advised. Depending on the imaging results and severity of the stroke  treatment plan may include thrombolytic therapy  antiplatelet therapy  and management of underlying risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Rehabilitation therapy will also be considered to aid in her recovery.
Stroke,1,50,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Introduction: I present a patient that is clinically diagnosed with stroke. Stroke is one of the leading causes of severe long-term disability and it affects a significant number of individuals  especially those aged 55 or more.  Patient Demographics: Our patient  Mr. Keith Foster  is a 68-year old African-American male born in Philadelphia  but now residing in a semi-rural town in Illinois. Mr. Foster is a retired school teacher  is married  and lives with his wife and their dog. His three grown-up children live within a 30-mile radius.   Past Medical History: Mr. Foster was diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago and has been on Losartan 50mg daily since then. However  his blood pressure measurements have been occasionally erratic and often higher than target range. Besides this  he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 6 years ago  currently managed with Metformin. He has been moderately compliant with his medication regimen  but struggles to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise program. Additionally  he has been a smoker for the past 30 years  and although he has attempted to quit several times  he has struggled with long-term cessation. Mr. Foster also has a family history of stroke; his mother suffered a stroke at age 70.  Present Presentation:  Mr. Foster was brought to the emergency room by his wife after she noticed him suddenly develop slurred speech and weakness on the right side of his body. He also reported feeling a sudden  severe headache. His Blood pressure was recorded as 170/100 mmHg. He has no history of similar symptoms in the past.  Conclusion:  Given Mr. Foster's age  race  and medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  along with his smoking habits  he presents high risk factors for stroke. Observing his current symptoms of sudden onset of difficulty in speaking  headache  and unilateral weakness  we can conclude that Mr. Foster is indeed experiencing a stroke episode. Immediate medical attention  including imaging and potential thrombolytic therapy  is necessary for appropriate treatment and to prevent further neurological damage.
Stroke,1,51,Title: Case Presentation: Stroke in an Elderly Male   Introduction: I present to you the case of Mr. Jones  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who had experienced sudden neurological deficits suggestive of a stroke. He was brought into the emergency department by his wife.  Demographic Information: Mr. Jones is a retiree residing in an urban setting on the outskirts of Seattle  Washington. He lives with his wife in their own home and used to work as an electrician prior to retirement. It is important to note that stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  and its risk increases with age.   Medical History: Mr. Jones has struggled with high blood pressure (hypertension) for the past 15 years  a factor which significantly increases the risk of stroke. Also  he has a 20-year history of cigarette smoking but quit 5 years ago. Mr. Jones has no known allergies. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  which has been managed with metformin. His blood sugar levels have been relatively well-controlled. His last HbA1c  six months prior to this incident  was 6.8%.  Mr. Jones also has a history of nephrolithiasis and had his last episode of kidney stones two years prior. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. He denies any history of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use.  Current Incident: Mr. Jones's wife noticed that he started slurring his speech and was unable to move his right arm while they were having dinner. She reported that these symptoms appeared suddenly  with no accompanying headache  chest pain  breathing difficulty or loss of consciousness.  On examination  Mr. Jones's blood pressure was found to be 156/98mmHg. His heart rate was 95 beats per minute  and he had with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  He showed signs of facial asymmetry with drooping of the right side of his mouth. His speech was slurred  and he was unable to lift his right arm. His muscular strength was 0/5 on the right side in both the upper and lower limbs  while on the left side  it was 5/5. His right-sided reflexes were diminished and sensation was reduced compared to the left side. His gait could not be assessed due to the sudden-onset right-sided weakness.  Conclusion: In conclusion  Mr. Jones is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a former smoker who has presented with classic symptoms of a stroke. His sudden neurological deficits and lack of mobility are of immediate concern and require urgent investigation and management.
Stroke,1,52,Title: Presentation of a 63-Year-Old Male with Stroke   -------------------------------------------------------  I. Introduction   Today  I am presenting a case of Mr. John Smith  a 63-year-old Caucasian male who has been transferred from his primary care physician's office to our hospital with suspected stroke.   II. Demographics  According to the American Stroke Association  stroke risk increases with age  and each decade after age 55 the stroke risk doubles. Coupled with the fact that Caucasian individuals have a higher propensity of stroke incidents compared to other racial groups  Mr. Smith falls into one of the highest risk categories.   III. Chief Complaint   Mr. Smith arrived at his primary care physician's office with complaints of sudden onset weakness on his right side  slurred speech  and difficulty in maintaining balance which started approximately two hours ago.   IV. Past Medical History  Mr. Smith's medical history is crucial due to a number of factors that may have led to his current condition:  1. Hypertension: He has a ten-year history of hypertension  not consistently well-controlled  and he admits to not taking his prescribed medication regularly. It's noteworthy that hypertension is the leading cause of strokes.  2. Diabetes: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus six years ago and has been on Metformin since.   3. Smoking: He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking and has made no serious attempts to quit.  4. Obesity: Mr. Smith is classified as obese with a BMI of 32.   V. Assessment   Upon examination  Mr. Smith demonstrates facial asymmetry with drooping of the right side of his face. His right arm demonstrates noticeable weakness  scoring a 1 on the NIH stroke scale. His speech is slurred but fairly understandable.  VI. Conclusion   Given the signs  symptoms  and Mr. Smith's past medical history  there is a strong presumption of ischemic stroke. Prompt initiation of stroke protocol including further diagnostic work and intervention is crucial at this stage- every minute counts.  Additional tests  including a CT scan of the head and blood tests  will be done to narrow down the cause of the stroke and further tailor Mr. Smith's treatment to his physiological needs. With early and appropriate intervention  we hope to minimize any long-term impacts from this potentially devastating event.
Stroke,1,53,Presentation of Patient with Stroke  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe  a 66-year-old African American male who lives in the urban setting  presented himself to the ER. He was accompanied by his wife who reported several episodes of the patient's difficulty speaking and unsteady gait. The patient himself complained of persistent headache and sudden numbness on the right side of his body. The symptoms started approximately 1.5 hours prior to his presentation.   Medical History: According to the collected medical history  Mr. Doe has been hypertensive and diabetic for the last 15 years. He has been on medications for both hypertension (Lisinopril 10mg daily) and diabetes (Metformin 500mg twice daily). Patient’s family history indicates that his father suffered a stroke at the age of 70. Mr. Doe is a former smoker who quit about 10 years ago  and drinks alcohol socially. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and adheres to a diet high in sodium and fats.   This demographic profile accurately aligns with the literature showing that stroke risk is higher among African American males over the age of 60  and those with hypertension  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle. Family history of stroke and dietary habits further increase the likelihood of stroke occurrence.   Suspicion of Stroke:  Considering the demographics  past medical history  and primary reports of symptoms  an urgent detailed neurological examination and diagnostic approach were initiated. The current symptoms and past medical history raise a high level of suspicion for a possible ischemic stroke.   It is crucial to manage this patient under the assumption of an acute neurological syndrome  possibly a stroke until proven otherwise  given the time-sensitive nature of this medical condition. Immediate evaluation and necessary medical intervention will be undertaken as per stroke protocol to prevent the progression of neuronal damage  if any  and to improve the potential outcomes for the patient.
Stroke,1,54,Title: Case Presentation: Mrs. Johnson - Stroke  Patient Introduction:  Mrs. Clara Johnson is a 78-year-old African-American female who lives with her husband in a private home in Brooklyn  New York. Prior to her recent episode  the patient lived independently and was socially very active with her extended family and in her community.   Presenting Concern: Mrs. Johnson was brought to the emergency department by her husband with a complaint of sudden onset difficulty speaking  right-sided facial drooping  and right-sided weakness  highly indicative of stroke. Her symptoms started three hours before she was brought in.  Past Medical History:  The patient is a known hypertensive for ten years  currently on Losartan 50 mg once daily. She is also a type II diabetic  treated with Metformin 850mg twice a day for the past seven years. Her diabetes and hypertension have been poorly controlled. She has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. She enjoys a glass of red wine with dinner and reports no history of illicit drug use. She admits not being regular with her medication  attributing this to forgetfulness.   Family History:  Mrs. Johnson's father passed away from a myocardial infarction at 67 and her mother from a stroke when she was 72. Of her 4 siblings  one brother also suffered from a stroke at 63 and another from coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination: Upon exam  her blood pressure was 170/95mmHg  pulse 84/min  and blood glucose 11.3 mmol/L. Neurological examination revealed that she has right hemiplegia and aphasia. Her remaining body systems were unremarkable on physical examination.  Summary: In conclusion  Mrs. Johnson is a 78-year-old African-American female with a history of poorly managed hypertension and type II diabetes  and a significant family history of stroke. These risk factors make her more vulnerable to experiencing a stroke. Prompt medical intervention is necessary to outline a personalized treatment plan for her. Her case highlights the importance of managing modifiable risk factors  like hypertension and diabetes  effectively to prevent such episodes from happening.
Stroke,1,55,Patient Presentation:  Allow me to present Mr. Jose Rodriguez  a 64-year-old Hispanic male  who resides in Los Angeles  California. He has a record of unmanaged chronic hypertension for the last seven years and was also diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus three years ago. However  his compliance with prescribed antihypertensive medications and diabetic management has been inconsistent over the years due to financial concerns and lack of knowledge about his health conditions.   Mr. Rodriguez is a smoker and has been smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 35 years. He only has minimal physical activity  mainly due to his job as a security guard which requires him to sit for prolonged hours. His diet often includes fast food  mainly due to the nature of his work schedule.  Recently  Mr. Rodriguez was rushed to the emergency department due to sudden loss of strength on his right side of the body and slurring of speech. His family noticed these changes which had lasted for about an hour before they decided to bring him in. Upon evaluation  he was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. His blood pressure upon arrival was notably high at 185/90 mmHg.  Mr. Rodriguez has no history of any cardiovascular incidents up until this event. There's also no documented severe allergy in his medical record. His family history is remarkable for stroke and heart disease  with his father having suffered a stroke at age 65 and his mother who died of heart disease at age 63.  I mention Mr. Rodriguez's case to draw attention to the burden that stroke has on minority and underserved populations. Hispanics have a higher risk of stroke and lower rate of stroke knowledge  according to a study published in the Journal of Aging and Health (2011). One in two Hispanic men and women are expected to develop type 2 diabetes during their lifetime  and Hispanics are 50% more likely to die from diabetes or liver disease compared to non-Hispanic whites  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is therefore critical that targeted interventions are developed to reduce these disparities and improve stroke-related outcomes in this population.
Stroke,1,56,Title: Presentation of Patient with Stroke  Slide 1: Introduction Our patient is Mrs. Anna Martinez  a 68-year-old African American female who presents with acute stroke symptoms. Studies have shown that women in the United States have a higher life-time risk of stroke as compared to men  and the prevalence of stroke is reportedly higher among African Americans.   Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms Mrs. Martinez arrived at the ER with signs of acute right-sided weakness  speech difficulties  and facial drooping. She was last seen in her usual state of health about 6 hours ago.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a significant past medical history. She is a known patient with hypertension for the past 15 years  and diabetes mellitus type 2 for the last 8 years. Both these conditions are managed with appropriate medications. Mrs. Martinez is also obese  with a BMI of 34. She is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago but still currently consumes alcohol moderately.   Slide 4: Family History  Her family history is notable for a father who had a stroke at the age of 70  and a mother who passed away from complications of heart disease.   Slide 5: Social History  Mrs. Martinez is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband of 40 years. She has 2 adult children who live nearby. She mentions that lately she has not been doing exercise due to the cold weather.   Slide 6: Summary  Mrs. Anna Martinez illustrates the typical patient at risk for stroke – older age  female  African American  hypertensive  diabetic  with family history of stroke. Her lifestyle factors such as obesity  previous smoking  and lack of physical exercise further exacerbate her risk. This real-world case re-emphasizes the importance of effective management of modifiable risk factors to prevent stroke incidence.
Stroke,1,57,Title: Presentation of a Geriatric Patient presenting with Stroke  Patient Information:   Mr. John Smith  a 75-year-old Caucasian male presented himself to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness in the right arm and leg  slurred speech  and facial droop on the left side that began 30 minutes prior to arrival. Mr. Smith is accompanied by his wife who provides the rest of the information on his behalf. They reside in Brooklyn  NY  and he is a retired engineer.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for: 1. Hypertension  2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) 3. Hyperlipidemia  4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5. Major depressive disorder   Despite having multiple chronic health conditions  the patient has been compliant with his medications. He takes Lisinopril  Metformin  Simvastatin  and Tamsulosin daily. Repair of left inguinal hernia was done 7 years ago. No known drug allergies. He quit smoking ten years ago after a forty-year history of a pack a day. Social alcohol intake is limited to special occasions. Family history is significant for stroke in his father.  Assessment:  According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC)  the incidence of stroke is higher among older adults  with the risk doubling every ten years after age 55. Moreover  those with a family history are at an increased risk of having a stroke  especially if the relative had a stroke at a young age. Hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus  Hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking also increase the risk for stroke.  Summary:  Mr. Smith's age  presence of chronic medical conditions like hypertension  Type II DM  hyperlipidemia  and personal habits such as smoking in the past  coupled with hereditary factors  put him at a significantly elevated risk for stroke. His presenting signs and symptoms align with acute ischemic stroke. Immediate stroke workup and appropriate management must be initiated without delay. His prognosis is uncertain at this stage and largely dependent on the extent and location of the ischemic event and how quickly treatment is initiated.
Stroke,1,58,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient's Demographic Information  Name: Mrs. Samantha Mullins Age: 69 years old Gender: Female Race/Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired Teacher Living Status: Living alone in downtown Chicago  with frequent visits from her adult children Hobbies: Gardening  reading  and volunteering at the local library  Past Medical History  Mrs. Mullins has a recorded history of hypertension  diagnosed about eight-ten years ago. Her blood pressure control has been sporadic  with occasional periods of forgetting medication or skipping doctor's appointments. In addition  she also has type II diabetes  which has been managed with oral antidiabetic drugs and lifestyle modifications over the past seven years. She used to smoke  but quit 25 years ago. There is no history of illicit drug usage but a moderate intake of alcohol.   Family history is also significant for cardiovascular diseases. Her father had a myocardial infarction at age 62 and her older sister  now deceased  had a stroke at the age of 73.   A physical examination documented approximately two months preceding the stroke revealed an elevated blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  despite being on antihypertensive  and her fasting blood glucose was slightly high  suggesting poor glycemic control. She was advised then to adhere strictly to her medications and reduce her sugar intake.  Her current medications include Lisinopril  a medication for her hypertension  and Metformin for her diabetes. She has no known allergies to medications.  Presentation  In the early hours of February 17th  Mrs. Mullins experienced an abrupt onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. Her son who was visiting at the time noted left facial droop and immediately called for an ambulance.  Enroute to the hospital  she remained conscious but showed clear signs of distress and confusion.  Ultimately  early recognition of these symptoms by her family and the emergency medical team led to prompt intervention at the hospital  improving her potential for recovery.   This case highlights the importance of managing chronic health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes to reduce the risk of developing severe complications such as a stroke.
Stroke,1,59,Patient Presentation:  Our patient Mr. Alfred Roberts is a 68-year-old African American male from urban New York City. He presents with the classic symptoms of a stroke  including difficulty speaking  sudden onset weakness on the left side of his body  confusion  and visual disturbances.   Mr. Roberts has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are risk factors for stroke. He has been prescribed medication for both hypertension and diabetes  but compliance and regular follow-up have been poor. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years and has a sedentary lifestyle. His family history is significant for stroke as his father suffered a stroke at the age of 72.   Demographics:  The choice of Mr. Roberts as a representative patient is supported by demographic statistics related to stroke. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  stroke is more common in certain racial and ethnic groups. African Americans are at nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with white people  and they have the highest rate of death due to stroke.   Aging is also a significant risk factor for stroke  with the chance of having a stroke doubling for each decade of life after age 55. More than two-thirds of all strokes occur in people over 65.  Moreover  men have a higher risk of stroke than women. However  because women live longer  their overall lifetime risk of stroke is higher. Urban populations also have higher stroke risks  probably due to varying socioeconomic and lifestyle factors.   Risk factors:  In addition to these demographic factors  the presence of certain medical conditions  including hypertension and diabetes  can significantly increase the risk of stroke. Mr. Roberts' history of poorly-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes are thus common factors that can lead to a stroke. Smoking and physical inactivity  coupled with a poor diet  can also increase stroke risk.  The case of Mr. Roberts is illustrative of the many intersecting factors that can contribute to stroke risk. He depicts the importance of prevention and risk factor management in mitigating the devastating impacts of this condition.
Stroke,1,60,Title: Stroke Patient Presentation   Introduction: Today  I am presenting a case of a 65-year-old African American female patient who presented with a stroke. Studies indicate that African American and Hispanic populations are at a greater risk of stroke  relative to other ethnic groups. Women are also slightly more likely to suffer from stroke than men  especially those over the age of 60.   Demographics: Mrs. Louise Thompson  a retired schoolteacher  resides in urban Atlanta  Georgia  in the United States with her husband. She is a non-smoker  but she has a history of mild obesity and occasional alcohol consumption.  Medical History: Mrs. Thompson's past medical history involves grade 2 hypertension diagnosed five years ago  however  her adherence to regular medication has been inconsistent. She has also been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes for the past ten years controlled with diet and Metformin. There is a family history of cerebrovascular diseases specifically  her mother succumbed to a stroke in her early seventies. Mrs. Thompson has not been diagnosed with any other major health issues previously.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Thompson arrived at the ER with complaints of sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking dating back to 2 hours ago. Her husband  who accompanied her  reported that she was responding less than usual and was unable to hold her coffee cup which dropped due to sudden weakness.  Conclusion: Taking into consideration her presenting symptoms  past medical history  and higher risk due to her race and age  Mrs. Thompson has been suspected to be suffering from an ischemic stroke. Following admission  she was quickly evaluated  and diagnostic tests were ordered  including neurological examination  brain imaging and blood tests. Fast diagnosis and treatment are imperative in stroke cases to limit brain damage and potential complications  hence her situation is considered critical and immediate medical attention is provided to mitigate the risks associated.

He is a retired automotive engineer with a fair SES  Medicare for insurance  and is a widower with 3 adult children. He is a former smoker  having quit 12 years ago but has a 50 pack-year smoking history. He reports moderate alcohol consumption of 5-6 units per week.   **Presenting Problem** Mr. Evans has attended the emergency room with acute onset of right side weakness  slurred speech  and reported difficulty in understanding what others were saying  which started approximately 2 hours prior to admission. He also reports a mild headache and feeling dizzy.   **Past Medical History** His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. All of these conditions are well-managed through medication and dietary measures. He had an ischemic stroke 4 years ago  which he fully recovered from with the help of physical rehabilitation. There is also a significant family history of stroke on his paternal side.   **Conclusion** Considering Mr. Evans’ age  sex  ethnicity  past medical history  history of smoking  and his current symptoms  he presents a classic case of potential ischemic stroke. Given his situation and previous stroke incidence  he falls within the characteristic demographic of those affected by stroke as supported by clinical literature.   The prompt recognition of his symptoms and seeking immediate medical assistance can significantly influence his prognosis. As such  his medical team should move ahead with neuroimaging  lab tests  and other diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy.
Stroke,1,62,Title: Brief Presentation of a Stroke Patient   I. Introduction  The patient is a 72-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson  hailing from Oakland  CA. He presented to our facility with symptoms suggesting a neurological deficit that appeared suddenly  consistent with stroke.   II. Background & Demographic Information   Mr. Johnson is a retired bus driver who has lived in Oakland for more than 50 years with his wife. They have three grown-up children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  stroke is the fifth cause of death in the U.S  with higher prevalence rates in the southeastern states and in African Americans  which corresponds with Mr. Johnson's demographic.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson has a significant history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. These are known major risk factors for stroke  especially in the African American population. He is compliant with his antihypertensive  antidiabetic and cholesterol-lowering medications. He has no known allergies. His family history includes his father having died of a stroke at the age of 78 and a brother with coronary artery disease. He used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day but quit 20 years ago. His alcohol consumption is minimal  consuming only a glass of wine during special occasions.   IV. Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Johnson presented with acute onset of slurred speech  right-sided facial droop  and right-sided weakness that began suddenly while having breakfast. His wife noticed these changes and promptly brought him to the emergency room.  V. Conclusion  In conclusion  the sudden onset of Mr. Johnson's neurological symptoms  together with his risk factors of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and family history  make acute ischemic stroke a likely diagnosis. His presentation reflects accurate demographic patterns found in literature  emphasizing the importance of careful assessment and prompt treatment in patients from at-risk communities.
Stroke,1,63,**Patient Presentation**  Demographic Information:  Name: Johnson Smith  Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Residence: Durham  North Carolina Marital status: Married Occupation: Retired engineer  **Brief History & Clinical Presentation**   Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired and a resident of Durham  North Carolina. He's been married for over 40 years and lives with his wife in their family home. This patient was brought to the Emergency Department by EMT services today after his wife noticed sudden signs of facial droop  slurred speech and weakness in the right side of his body. The symptoms occurred abruptly while he was reading his morning newspaper and persisted  prompting his wife to call for emergency services.   Upon arrival  vitals were stable. His Glasgow Coma Scale was scored at 14 and he was alert and oriented to person  place  but not time. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was calculated to be 7  indicative of a likely moderate stroke.  **Past Medical History**   Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are generally well-managed with medication: Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. He does not have a history of diabetes. There is a family history of vascular disease  with his father having suffered from a stroke at the age of 72. He's not on any anticoagulant therapy. His last routine health checkup was 6 months ago and was largely unremarkable.  **Assessment**   Given his symptoms and risk factors  Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke  the most common type of stroke in his age group and ethnicity. His age  gender and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia also fall in line with common risk factors for stroke. Immediate intervention and further medical management are paramount to help limit the neural damage and improve his long-term outcome.
Stroke,1,64,Patient Presentation: Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 68-year-old African American male presenting with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech beginning two hours ago. He has difficulty understanding instructions and following commands  suggestive of receptive aphasia also known as Wernicke’s aphasia.   Demographics:  Mr. Doe is retired and lives with his wife of forty years in a suburban neighborhood. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history but quit approximately fifteen years ago. He occasionally uses alcohol  specifically about two glasses of wine or less per week. He follows a diet that his wife prepares for him  which is a balanced diet with occasional indulgence in fast food. His ethnicity makes him statistically more prominent in stroke incidences. In the United States  African Americans have nearly twice the risk of the first-ever stroke compared with Caucasians.  Past Medical History:  Upon reviewing  Mr. Doe has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years and type II diabetes mellitus for five years. His medication regimen includes Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose Aspirin. He reports being non-compliant with taking medications consistently in the past six months. Also  there is a past medical history of myocardial infarction seven years ago which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 72  while his mother died of heart disease at 75.   Overall  the combination of older age  African American ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  previous myocardial infarction  and particular family history place Mr. Doe at a significantly high risk of stroke. His symptoms  notably sudden onset weakness and aphasia  are strongly suggestive of stroke  possibly of the ischemic type considering his medical history.
Stroke,1,65,Title: Stroke Presentation in an Elderly White Female with Hypertension and Diabetes  Patient Profile: The patient is Ms. Jane Doe  a 72-year-old white  non-Hispanic female currently living in an urban community in Miami  Florida. She is English-speaking with no known difficulties understanding or following care instructions. Widowed  she lives alone but her daughter stays in close proximity and provides aid as needed. Jane is retired and relies on social security for income.   Past Medical History: Jane Doe has a substantial medical history. Her medical records suggest that she has been hypertensive (high blood pressure) for the last twenty years and diabetic (type II) for fifteen years. Both conditions are managed with prescribed medications - Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. She also has a diet plan mapped out by a dietician to assist in managing her health conditions. Jane has been proactive on routine medical visits and her blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been under control mostly. Additionally  Jane quit smoking twenty-five years back and drinks alcohol occasionally  fewer than 3 glasses per week.  Acute Presentation: Jane presented with signs and symptoms of stroke including a sudden feeling of numbness on the left side of her body  which started with the face  arm  and then extended to her legs. It was accompanied by slurred speech  sudden vision disturbances in one eye  general confusion  disorientation  and unsteadiness. These signs appeared a few hours ago and were first noticed by her daughter who called for emergency assistance.  In our case  Jane represents a typical stroke patient  being over 65 years of age  as most stroke cases are seen in this age group. She also has known risk factors for stroke like hypertension  diabetes  and smoking  which aligns with the literature findings indicating the higher incidence of stroke in patients with these features.  Her condition is critical and needs immediate evaluation and treatment following the Stroke pathway.
Stroke,1,66,"Title: A Case Presentation on Stroke  Introduction: Today  we delve into the case of John  a 78-year-old male  who presents with signs indicative of a recent stroke. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is a significant cause of adult disability. While the risk of stroke increases with age  the condition affects people across a wide demographic range.  Patient Information: John is a Caucasian male as stroke incidence is highest among whites  followed by African-Americans. He resides in a rural area in the Southern United States - a region known as the """"Stroke Belt"""" due to its high stroke mortality rates.   Presenting Complaint: John was brought to the emergency department by his caregiver who noticed his sudden inability to speak and use the right side of his body. He seemed confused and had problems with balance.  Medical History: John has a documented history of hypertension  which is the leading cause of stroke. He also suffers from atrial fibrillation detected during his routine medical check-ups. This irregular heart rhythm considerably increases the chances of clot formation in the heart  leading to a stroke.  Lifestyle: John has a history of smoking tobacco and heavy alcohol use  both of which have reportedly increased his risk of stroke. His diet is high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables  likely contributing to his hypertension.   Family History: John's father had a stroke in his late 70s which elevates John’s risk as well.  Medications: He is currently on antihypertensives  antiarrhythmics  and a statin for high cholesterol - a trio of medications common amongst patients with an elevated risk for stroke.  Clinical Examination: A physical examination revealed a drooping face on the right side  slurred speech  and difficulty lifting both his right arm and leg. His blood pressure reading was 160/90 mm Hg  higher than the normal range.  Management: Further diagnostic testing  including a CT scan and blood tests  will be done immediately. Depending on the results  John may receive thrombolytic therapy if deemed necessary and safe. Long-term management may include modifications to his current drug regimen and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking  moderate alcohol consumption  healthier diet  and starting exercises. Rehabilitation therapies to help regain lost motor functions due to stroke would also be started as soon as possible.  Conclusion: John's age  race  geographic location  pre-existing medical conditions  family history  and lifestyle habits all contribute to his high-risk status for stroke. Consequentially  timely interventions and appropriate management strategies are essential in minimizing the disability and improving his quality of life post-stroke."
Stroke,1,67,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Name: Mr. Jerry Smith Age: 67 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired Army Officer Patient's Residence: Albuquerque  New Mexico Marital Status: Married  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith  an elderly African-American retired army officer  has presented with a two-hour history of sudden onset weakness on the right side of his body. His speech appears to be slurred and his family reports that his face appears to be drooping on the right side.  Past Medical History: History of Hypertension and Type-II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years. He also has a known history of hyperlipidemia. He had been undergoing treatment for these conditions and has been reasonably compliant with his medication.  Family History: His father suffered a stroke at the age of 72. His elder brother also has longstanding hypertension and was diagnosed with a heart condition two years ago.  Social History: He is a non-smoker and an occasional drinker. He has been on a fairly balanced diet along with a modest exercise regimen with minimal regular physical activity.  Risk Factors:  Mr. Smith's primary risk factors include his African-American descent  which has been linked to a higher prevalence of stroke according to research. He also has hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Diabetes Mellitus  all well-documented risk factors for a stroke. His advanced age and male gender increase his risks furthermore. Family history of cardiovascular disease also poses an additional risk.   In conclusion  considering Mr. Smith's presenting symptoms of facial drooping  arm weakness  and speech difficulties along with his multiple risk factors  he is suspected to have suffered an ischemic stroke. An urgent neurology consult  brain imaging  and appropriate management are needed in this suspected stroke event.  This patient presentation has incorporated demographic representation (particularly of race and age) in stroke patients  as available in current stroke literature. It highlights the need for vigilance in patients with comorbid conditions  such as diabetes and hypertension  especially in older  African-American populations. 
Stroke,1,68,Patient Presentation:  The patient before us today is Mrs. Mabel Crawford  a 68-year-old African-American female from urban New York reported to the Emergency Department mid-morning presenting with symptoms of a possible ischemic stroke. Mrs. Crawford is otherwise healthy  with some history of hypertension  but not on regular medication.  Mrs. Crawford was brought in by her daughter who noticed her mother’s slurred speech and drooping face earlier in the morning. Mrs. Crawford also complained of a sudden  severe headache and showed significant weakness in her right arm and leg. They have arrived here within the optimal window of 4.5 hours of her symptoms onset.  In her past medical history  Mrs. Crawford was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago. However  her blood pressure and overall health have been managed reasonably well with lifestyle modifications including a low sodium diet  regular physical activity  and moderate alcohol consumption. In terms of family history  her mother had a stroke at age 72  and her father had a coronary artery disease. She has never smoked in her life and has no history of diabetes  high cholesterol  coronary artery disease or any other cardiovascular conditions.  In terms of social history  Mrs Crawford is a retired school teacher  a widow  and lives with her daughter and two grandchildren. She is a well-respected community leader  cares deeply about her neighborhood  and spends most of her time indulging in community service.  Considering her sudden onset of symptoms  past family history of stroke  and personal history of hypertension  we need to consider the probability of an ischemic stroke. Mrs. Crawford will immediately undergo a detailed neurological examination and a brain scan to confirm the diagnosis.   In terms of demographic representation  stroke prevalence is higher in women over the age of 65. In the African-American population  stroke is more common and more deadly compared to the general population  largely due to conditions like hypertension being significantly more prevalent. Urban areas like New York  are more affected due to lifestyle factors and health disparities  making Mrs. Crawford a typical representative of stroke patients based on age  race  and geography.   This case offers us a compelling opportunity to discuss the primary and secondary prevention of stroke in individuals at risk and to highlight the importance of urgent medical attention when stroke symptoms occur.
Stroke,1,69,Presentation of Patient:   I am presenting a case of a 73-year-old African American male  Mr. John Walker  who arrived in the emergency room with the signs and symptoms indicative of an acute ischemic stroke. According to U.S. data  African Americans are more likely to experience a stroke than whites  and their stroke risk is two times higher.  Demographic Information:  The patient was born and raised in the United States and is retired from a career at the local factory. Mr. Walker is a non-drinker and non-smoker. However  he admits to living a sedentary lifestyle and is categorized as overweight based on his BMI.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Walker has a known medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which he has had for the past 15 years. Both conditions are relatively well-controlled with medication  however  he sometimes fails to adhere to a regular medication schedule. His family history is significant: his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his older brother suffered a stroke at the age of 70.  Current Presentation:  He was brought to the ER by a neighbor after experiencing sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurring of speech which lasted for about an hour. His neighbor noticed the changes during their regular morning chat and immediately called for medical help.   Initial Examination:  Upon examination  he was found conscious  but his speech was slurred and he had right-sided hemiparesis. His blood pressure reading was elevated  registering at 170/95 mmHg  and his random plasma glucose level was higher than his usual range. His heart rhythm demonstrated atrial fibrillation on the ECG  which is a potentially new finding as his previous medical records had no mention of this condition.  In summary  this particular case represents Mr. Walker  a 73-year-old African American male patient diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  presenting with signs and symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke. The demographic details and medical history raise important issues regarding the management and significance of modifiable risk factors in preventing a possible debilitating medical condition like a stroke.
Stroke,1,70,Title: Acute Stroke Presentation   Introduction:   Today  we present a case of Mrs. Eunice Murray  a 73-year-old African-American female who was rushed to the emergency department presenting signs of a stroke. While stroke incidence has decreased for the elderly White American population  a higher incidence of stroke is reported among the elderly African-American population  making our case typical.  Demographic Information:  Mrs. Eunice is from Baton Rouge  Louisiana. She's a retired school teacher  and lives with her husband  Morris. She stopped her casual alcohol intake after her retirement and she has never smoked. However  she's obese (BMI 33)  does not engage in regular exercise and has a history of poor diet - high consumption of fats and sugar. Her family history reveals that her father died from a cerebrovascular accident at 79.   Past Medical History:  Upon further exploration of Mrs. Eunice's medical history  we found several risk factors contributing to her current presentation. She has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago which she manages with medication (metformin) as well as diet control  not always strictly adhered to. In recent years  she has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and was prescribed statins which she claims to take irregularly. There were also signs of atrial fibrillation (AF) seen in her last routine checkup two months ago  for which a cardiology follow up was suggested but not yet attended.  Her compliance with her medication routine is poor and due to her insurance  she admits to sometimes having difficulties affording necessary medications. Moreover  social factors like her reluctance to bother her busy working children weigh heavily on her medical adherence.  Presentation:  In accordance with her risk factors  Mrs. Eunice arrived at the emergency department with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke  including sudden numbness and weakness on the right side of her body  difficulty with speech  sudden severe headache  and trouble with coordination.   Conclusion:  Given Mrs. Eunice's characteristic demographic profile i.e.  elderly  African-American  obese  and a medical history of high blood pressure  diabetes  and AF  the need for intervention to manage such modifiable risk factors becomes crucial. Furthermore  her case underlines the severe implications of poor medication adherence and the impact of healthcare cost barriers. This case mandates that we don't just look at the 'what' of the patient presentation  but the 'why'  addressing the root causes in order to plan patient-centered prospective care.

Stroke,1,71,Title: Case Presentation of a 65-year-old Male with Stroke  Introduction: Today  we will discuss a case involving a 65-year-old African American male  Mr. Walter Brown  who presented with clinical features of a stroke.  Demographic Information: Mr. Brown is a retired truck driver living in Atlanta  Georgia  currently under the care of his wife. He is a non-smoker with light alcohol consumption. He has a BMI of 27 and lives in a suburban neighborhood with limited access to healthcare facilities. His diet mainly consists of high fatty food and lacks adequate fruits and vegetables.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  both are known risk factors for stroke. His hypertension was diagnosed 15 years ago and has been generally well controlled with medication  although he has had sporadic periods of non-compliance with medication due to logistical difficulties. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years ago and is primarily controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents  but his HbA1C level fluctuates  indicating sub-optimal control. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died following a myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his eldest brother had a stroke at 63.   Presentation: Mr. Brown was brought to the emergency department by his wife after he suddenly experienced severe headache  followed by weakness in the right side of his body and slurred speech. Upon admission  his blood pressure was elevated  and a CT scan revealed an ischemic stroke.  In Summary: In conclusion  Mr. Brown's demographic and past medical history collectively indicate a high risk for stroke. As an African American with a family history of cardiovascular diseases  hypertension  and poorly managed diabetes  he falls into a high-risk category. His case highlights the importance of optimal control and treatment adherence in chronic conditions to prevent cerebrovascular events such as stroke.  Recommendations: Interdisciplinary intervention involving medical management  education  and lifestyle modifications is crucial to prevent future strokes. Strict control of his blood pressure and diabetes are paramount  as well as transitioning to a healthier diet and more active lifestyle. Given the limited access to healthcare services in his area  telemedicine consultations may also be beneficial to regularly monitor his condition. His case also underscores the significant role of primary care clinicians in managing and minimizing stroke risk in similar patients.
Stroke,1,72,Title: Case Presentation: Mr. Alvarez  a Case of Stroke  I. Introduction I would like to present a case of a 68-year-old Hispanic male  Mr. Roberto Alvarez  who comes from a middle-class background. Mr. Alvarez is a retired school teacher  currently living with his wife in Houston  Texas. The patient has been brought to our emergency department with the sudden onset of difficulty in speaking and right-sided weakness.   II. Past Medical History  Mr. Alvarez's medical history reveals that he has been enduring several chronic conditions for more than ten years. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension  both managed by medication and regular check-ups.   In addition  the patient has a known history of hyperlipidemia and intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he is on an anticoagulant. According to the patient’s clinical records  Mr. Alvarez has been a smoker for around 30 years but quit 8 years ago. Furthermore  he has a family history of cardiovascular diseases: his father passed away from myocardial infarction at age 72  and his elder brother suffers from angina pectoris.  III. Current Presentation Mr. Alvarez awoke from sleep around 6:30 AM when he felt an abrupt weakness in his right arm and leg. He tried to get up  but he fell due to the sudden loss of balance. He shouted for help  but he found it difficult to form words. His wife immediately noticed his slurring speech and drooping face and called 911.   Paramedics arrived at the scene within 10 minutes and a quick assessment showed: BP 180/95 mmHg; pulse 105 bpm and irregular; respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute; temperature 98.7ºF; oxygen saturation 97% in room air; and glucose 170 mg/dL. His NIH Stroke Scale score was 12.  IV. Conclusion Mr. Alvarez is presenting with signs and symptoms usually encountered with a stroke  possibly ischemic in nature given his medical history. Immediate brain imaging and further diagnostic workup for stroke are indicated in order to guide appropriate and timely treatment plan.  Overall  this case illustrates the intricacy and urgency of stroke presentations  necessitating swift identification and timely management to reduce the risk of long-term complications. It also highlights the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and hyperlipidemia  to potentially prevent such emergencies.
Stroke,1,73,Title: Case Presentation of Patient with Stroke   Patient Information: The patient  Mr. George Wilson  is a 68-year-old African American male who presented with acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. He is retired  married  and resides in Chicago  Illinois. The patient has a 20-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been moderately controlled with medication. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and has a moderate alcohol consumption of 2-3 drinks per week.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Wilson arrived at the emergency department reporting a rapid onset of weakness in his right arm and leg which occurred while he was having dinner with his family. He also mentioned difficulty in speaking and finding the right words  but denied any headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  nausea  or vomiting.   Recent Past Medical History: Three months prior  Mr. Wilson had a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) but made a full recovery and since then he has been regular with his medications  which include Metformin  Atorvastatin  and Lisinopril. His last check-up a month ago showed well-controlled blood glucose and blood pressure levels. He does not have any other significant past medical or surgical history  and there is no known history of cerebrovascular accidents or heart diseases in the family.   Demographics and Stroke: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  with a disproportionate impact on African American  male  and older populations. Hypertension and diabetes  both of which Mr. Wilson has  are significant risk factors for stroke. Moreover  his recent TIA also increases his susceptibility.   This case clearly indicates subtypes of stroke  either an ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. Precise diagnosis and consequent management can mitigate the impacts  with early detection being a key determinant for a better prognosis. This account highlights the importance of controlling risk factors  seeking early medical attention  and tracking symptoms for individuals like Mr. Wilson who are at a higher risk of experiencing a stroke.
Stroke,1,74,Subject: Presentation of A Stroke Patient  Patient Information:  Name: Horace Henderson  Gender: Male  Age: 65 years  Ethnicity: African American  Occupation: Retired. Address: Denver  Colorado  USA. Primary Language: English.  Chief Complain:  Mr. Henderson presents with a sudden onset of difficulty in speaking  right-sided weakness  and numbness. He reports that these symptoms started about three hours before he arrived at the hospital.   History of Present Illness:  Approximately three hours ago  while Mr. Henderson was watching television  he suddenly started experiencing difficulty in finding words and difficulty in talking clearly. He also noticed that the right side of his body felt weak and he experienced numbness. He has a slight headache but denies any blurred vision  confusion  or difficulty balancing.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Henderson has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which have been managed with medications for the last 10 years. He also had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) about five years ago. He has been on regular follow-up with his primary healthcare provider and up-to-date with his medications. He quit smoking five years ago but has a smoking history of 20 pack-years. Alcohol consumption is moderate and occasional. He does not have any known allergies. Family history is significant for stroke  with his father having suffered a stroke at the age of 70.  Summary:  Mr. Henderson  a 65-year-old African-American male  with a past medical history of hypertension  TIA  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  presents with sudden onset right-sided weakness  numbness  and speech difficulties. It is critical to take his state seriously given his past medical history and immediate family history of stroke. Further diagnostic tests are recommended to rule out an acute ischemic stroke and determine the next steps in his medical management.   This case presentation is congruent with the literature  as stroke is more common in individuals over the age of 60 and among those with risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  previous TIA  smoking  and African American ethnicity. Addressing these risk factors is a crucial part of stroke prevention strategies. 
Stroke,1,75,"Title: Clinical Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old female  Mrs. Susan  a retired school teacher from Atlanta  Georgia. She is African American  married  and lives with her husband. According to the U.S. Census Bureau  Atlanta has a high African-American median age (33 years) and older African-Americans are more likely to experience stroke than other ethnicities.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both managed with appropriate medications and dietary adjustments. She does not smoke but used to be a heavy smoker for several decades. She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia.   Stroke is common in patients with these health conditions. Notably  hypertension is the primary risk factor for ischemic stroke in the elderly. Research shows that the risk of stroke is double for individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. The occurrence of stroke is higher among individuals with hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately  the patient's years of smoking significantly add to her stroke risk.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. Susan knocks on the emergency department's door with a sudden weakness on the right side of her body  notably her arm  and face. She is having difficulty speaking and her speech is slurred. Her family members noted these symptoms a few hours ago  and after recognizing these signs from a social media campaign about stroke  they brought her to the hospital immediately.   These symptoms are classic signs of stroke  underlined by the mnemonic """"FAST""""- facial drooping  arm weakness  speech difficulties  and time to call an ambulance.   Assessment and Potential Diagnosis:  Considering the patient's age  medical history  and presentation  the preliminary diagnosis is an ischemic stroke. This is supported by her risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  previous smoking habit  and the sudden onset of classical stroke symptoms.   This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and management of these preexisting conditions  along with lifestyle changes to help reduce the risk of a severe health event like a stroke.  Next Steps:  The next step is to confirm the diagnosis through imaging techniques such as a CT scan to locate the clot and determine the type and severity of the stroke. Prompt treatment is urgent to minimize brain damage. Potential treatments may include tissue plasminogen activator  antiplatelet drugs  anticoagulants  or a mechanical thrombectomy.  Long-term management will need to address lifestyle modifications and strict control of her blood pressure  diabetes  and cholesterol levels. She will likely require rehabilitation services to aid in recovery from any lasting neurological deficits.

Additionally  AIS occurs earlier in life for African-Americans and hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus are more prevalent  which may contribute to their increased stroke risk.  Slide 6: Conclusion  Providing prompt and culturally sensitive care to Mrs. Thompson  taking into account her age  race  and co-morbid conditions  is essential to manage her current situation effectively. Understanding her specific social context  further enhances the personalized approach towards her care and recovery from this stroke episode.
Stroke,1,81,Title: Case Presentation: Vascular Stroke   Presentation:  Our patient for today is a 72-year-old African American male who was brought to the emergency department due to the sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurry speech  and drooping face. Astute nursing staff identified these as classic symptoms of stroke and promptly provided him the necessary immediate attention.  Demographic Details:  As per the demographic data  stroke is more prevalent in aged individuals  specifically over the age of 65. Additionally  research has shown that African American men are at a high risk of stroke  compounded by our patient's older age. Our patient is a retired mechanic  lives with his wife  and has three grown-up children. He resides in the urban setting of Chicago.  Past Medical History:  Our patient has a significant past medical history  including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he has been managing for the past ten years. Insulin and anti-hypertensive medication form part of his daily medication regimen. He also has a history of habitual tobacco use (30 pack-years) but quit smoking five years ago. He has no known drug allergies and reports occasional moderate alcohol use during social events.  Family History:  His family history is also remarkable for cardiovascular diseases; both his father and elder brother died from myocardial infarction before the age of 65. His mother had diabetes  and one of his sisters was diagnosed with stroke in her late 60s.  This extensive medical and family history  coupled with his age and demographic background  increases his risk of stroke. As such  management of his condition needs to consider all these factors. Our target now is to stabilize the patient  prevent complications  and commence rehabilitation to improve his quality of life moving forward.

Stroke,1,83,Title: Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient Profile: The patient was an African American male in his late 60s residing in the United States. He was a retired construction worker and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient was brought to the hospital with symptoms of sudden onset slurred speech and right-side numbness. He also complained of visual disturbances and severe headache.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was a smoker for 20 years but has quit for the past 15 years. Prior to his presentation  he was not on regular follow-ups for his medical conditions. He was non-compliant with his medications due to social and economic barriers. There is no history of diabetes mellitus or previous strokes.   Epidemiological Evidence: The demographic represents classic stroke risk factors like advanced age  male gender  African American ethnicity  family history of stroke  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Studies showed that African American men are at a significantly high risk of having a stroke  especially if they have a family history of the disease and encounter socioeconomic disparities. Non-compliance to medications and infrequent medical follow-ups also heighten the risks.  To conclude  this overview provides a glimpse of a typical case of an acute stroke patient. Early recognition of risk factors can aid in preventive measures  and early symptom detection can lead to a fast response  minimizing fatal outcomes. It is crucial to advocate for regular medical check-ups and adherence to medications  especially among high-risk populations.

Stroke,1,84,Patient Presentation:  We have a 68-year-old African-American female presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute ischemic stroke. The patient  Mrs. Betty Williams  hails from Chicago  Illinois  with a socio-economic status falling in the middle-class bracket. She is a retired elementary school teacher  married  with two adult-age children and four grandchildren. Her ethnicity is significant  as studies have pointed out a higher incidence and risk factor of stroke among African-Americans than in other demographic groups.  Mrs. Williams has a relevant past medical history. She has been on medication for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for over a decade. She also has high cholesterol which is being managed with a statin regime and has a history of cigarette smoking  although she quit about five years ago. She has no known allergies to medications. She is diligent about her treatment and follow-ups for chronic conditions. She is currently on regular medications: Amlodipine 5mg for her hypertension  Metformin 500mg for diabetes  and Atorvastatin 10mg for her hyperlipidemia.   Mrs. Williams' familial medical history reveals that her mother was affected by stroke disease at the age of 72  indicating a likely genetic link strengthening her pre-disposition to stroke. Her diet is not commendable as she often indulges in high caloric  high sodium  and fatty foods. She does not have a dedicated exercise regimen. Despite knowing that her lifestyle decisions could contribute to her health complications  she struggles with making consistent changes.  Over the course of the past few hours  Mrs. Williams noticed sudden difficulty speaking coupled with facial drooping and limb weakness on her right side. It was her husband who recognized these manifestations as classic stroke symptoms and took the necessary step of bringing her to the hospital immediately. Considering her socioeconomic strata  she has viable health insurance that should provide her with easy access to requisite comprehensive care.  The next critical steps will be to confirm the diagnosis through immediate neuroimaging; evaluate her eligibility for thrombolytic therapy given the time frames  and then subsequently mobilize multidisciplinary stroke team input for the best comprehensive management.
Stroke,1,85,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  I. Introduction I would like to present the case of a patient diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident  more widely known as a stroke.   II. Demographic Information Based on typical demographic data regarding stroke  our patient is a 67-year-old African-American male named Mr. Johnson. He resides in a suburban community with his wife and is a retired engineer.   III. Clinical History Mr. Johnson has a medical history that is critical to understanding his risk for stroke. He has been hypertensive for over 15 years  and although he is under medication (Losartan 50 mg daily)  his blood pressure control has been inconsistent. Furthermore  he has been suffering from type 2 diabetes for the last ten years which he manages with Metformin. He sought clinical assistance after experiencing difficulty in moving his right arm and leg  along with some difficulty in speech.   IV. Lifestyle Factors Mr. Johnson has a history of smoking for about 30 years  though quit 5 years ago. His diet includes frequent consumption of high-sodium and high-fat foods  despite dietary advice due to his medical conditions. It is important to note that he has a family history of stroke as his father suffered a stroke at the age of 70.   V. Conclusion In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's age  gender  race  hypertension  poor dietary habits  family history of stroke  diabetes mellitus  history of smoking  and blood pressure management issues all contributed to his high risk for stroke. All these factors reflect in the current demographics and risk factors linked with stroke. A combination of medical treatment and lifestyle changes will be needed to manage Mr. Johnson's condition and prevent future strokes.
Stroke,1,86,"""""Good afternoon everyone   Today  we'll be discussing our patient  Mr. Williams  who is presenting with a stroke. Mr. Williams is a 67-year-old African American male  as we know  stroke incidents are more common in the African American community.  Mr. Williams is a retired schoolteacher who lives with his wife in the suburbs of Chicago. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which have been managed with medication for the last 15 years.   As for his lifestyle  Mr. Williams is a former 40 pack-year smoker but quit smoking ten years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally  mainly during social events. He is moderately active  however  his diet is high in sodium and fats which contribute to his weight being slightly above the recommended range for his height.  He came into the Emergency Department this morning complaining of sudden weakness on his left side along with difficulty in speech. His wife noticed his facial drooping on the left side and he was unable to lift his left arm  hence  she immediately decided to call emergency services considering these concerning symptoms.  Upon arrival at the hospital  Mr. Williams was immediately sent for a brain CT scan  which illustrated a sizeable ischemic area in his right middle cerebral artery distribution  suggestive of an ischemic stroke.  Right now  our main goal for Mr. Williams is to stabilize his current conditions  manage his symptoms  and prevent any further complications through accurate treatment and care strategies. We are also concerned with assessing modifiable risk factors in his lifestyle and putting interventions in place to reduce the likelihood of future stroke incidents.  In conclusion  Mr. Williams's case highlights the importance of understanding our patients' lifestyle habits  health history  and predispositions when diagnosing and developing treatment plans. It also emphasizes the need for preventive measures for diseases like stroke  particularly in high-risk communities.”  Thank you "
Stroke,1,87,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient Information: 'Mr. James Connor' Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Middle School Teacher Residential Area: Urban  specifically  Detroit  Michigan   Marital Status: Married with two adult children  Chief Compliant: Sudden  one-sided weakness and difficulty with speech.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. Connor is a 68-year-old right-handed male who was in his usual state of health until about two hours ago when he suddenly developed slurred speech and weakness in his right arm and leg. His wife reported that while they were having breakfast  Mr. Connor stopped midway through a sentence  appeared confused  and was unable to pick up his cup of coffee with his right hand due to weakness; his words were """"not coming out correctly"""".   This was followed by motor difficulty  stumbling while trying to stand up from his chair. There was no associated headache  dizziness  blurry vision  confusion  or difficulty swallowing. He has never experienced anything like this before.  Past Medical History: Mr. Connor has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he takes regularly prescribed medications for- Amlodipine and Rosuvastatin respectively. He is a former smoker but quit 15 years ago. He has a family history of stroke with his father suffering a stroke at age 72.  Physical Examination: On examination  his blood pressure is 158/92 mmHg  heart rate is 78 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute  and he is afebrile. His speech is slurred and he is unable to raise his right arm against gravity. There is also decreased strength in the right leg compared to the left.  Assessment: Given the sudden onset of his symptoms with no apparent cause  Mr. Connor's presentation is characteristic of a stroke  more specifically  a suspected ischemic stroke. The neurologic deficits correspond to a likely left middle cerebral artery territory involvement but will need a CT scan to confirm.  Plan: Mr. Connor's case would be seen as high priority  with the acute new onset of focal neurological symptoms being quite alarming and needing immediate further evaluation and management. Blood tests  EKG  and urgent non-contrast CT scan of the brain will be performed. If the CT scan shows no hemorrhage  thrombolytic therapy should be considered  given the timeline of presentation.   This case presentation depicts a common representation of a stroke patient in terms of demographics  as reflected in literature. Risk factors such as age  male sex  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  previous smoking history  and family history of stroke are all cited as significant factors responsible for stroke occurrence."
Stroke,1,88,Title: Clinical Presentation of Stroke in a Geriatric Patient  Introduction:  Today  we will be discussing a case of a 72-year-old African American female patient. She presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms correlating to an acute ischemic stroke.   Demographics:  The patient is a retired school teacher living in an urban setting  residing with her 75-year-old husband who serves as her primary caregiver. She is originally from Mississippi but migrated to New York in her early 30s. Our patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. She represents a commonly affected demographic since the African American population has a relatively high risk of stroke compared to other ethnicities. Moreover  the risk of stroke incrementally elevates after the age of 55  irrespective of gender.  Medical History:  Our patient has a significant medical history consisting of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both controlled with oral medications. She was previously diagnosed with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) two years ago. She also has hyperlipidemia for which she takes a statin and maintains a low-fat diet. Additionally  she had a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib)  which increases the risk of a stroke; however  she hasn't been compliant with her anticoagulation therapy. Her family history reveals her father died from a stroke at the age of 68.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient arrived at the ER exhibiting drooping of the left side of her face  arm weakness  and slight slurring of her speech. She informed us that these symptoms occurred suddenly while she was preparing breakfast. Her husband noted a change in her behavior  confusion  and difficulties maintaining balance. The changes in speech  loss of balance  and sudden confusion are relatively common symptoms of a stroke  consistent with her presentation.  Conclusion:  Considering her demographics  pre-existing comorbidities  and sudden onset of symptoms  the patient's condition was swiftly recognized as a stroke. She was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale and a CT scan was promptly performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out a hemorrhagic stroke. Given these findings and the patient’s history  she was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke likely secondary to her AFib and non-compliance with anticoagulation therapy. Further clinical management includes risk factor modification  acute stroke care  potential thrombolytic therapy  and post-acute care planning  emphasizing her need to comply with her medication regimen.    In summary  her story emphasizes the importance of compliance with medication in managing chronic diseases  particularly in high-risk individuals like this patient  to prevent debilitating or life-threatening conditions such as a stroke.
Stroke,1,89,Title: Stroke Case Presentation - Mr. Paul Jackson  Demographics:  Name: Mr. Paul Jackson Age: 69 Years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer (consistent with higher incidence of stroke in those with less physical occupation) Residence: St. Louis  MO Marital Status: Married  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Jackson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset speech difficulties  right-sided facial droop  and weakness in the right arm  suggestive of a possible stroke. His symptoms started approximately two hours before coming to the hospital. He also reported a severe headache without any known triggers.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Mr. Jackson has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years. He is currently on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril)  but adherence has been variable  which has resulted in poorly controlled blood pressure at clinic visits.  2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed six years ago  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin).  3. Hyperlipidemia: He is on a statin (Atorvastatin)  but the control has proved to be challenging  potentially due to dietary non-compliance.  4. Previous transient ischemic attack (TIA): Mr. Jackson experienced a TIA five years ago  with full recovery of his symptoms.   5. Current Smoker: Mr. Jackson has been a smoker for 45 years  with a 30 pack-year history.  In summary  Mr. Jackson is a 69-year-old Caucasian male patient with uncontrolled hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  a history of TIA  and an extensive smoking history. These comorbidities and lifestyle factors place him at a high risk of stroke. The presenting symptoms of sudden speech difficulties  right-sided facial droop  right arm weakness  and severe headache are highly suggestive of an ongoing acute stroke. Immediate diagnostic workup and management are critical to limit the extent of cerebral damage and improve his prognosis.
Stroke,1,90,Title: Stroke Case Presentation  I. Introduction  Our patient is a 76-year-old African American man named Mr. John Smith.  II. Demographics Information  Mr. Smith is retired and lives in Detroit  Michigan with his wife. The patient is of middle socioeconomic status and has a healthcare plan that covers most of his expenses. He is a non-smoker but has a history of frequent alcohol consumption. Mr. Smith is moderately overweight  which contributes to his risk factors of hypertension and atherosclerosis. He has never been diagnosed with diabetes.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with hypertension about ten years ago. He is under treatment with antihypertensive medications  including Amlodipine. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia diagnosed six years ago and has been under regular treatment with statins.  IV. History of Current Illness  On the day of admission  Mr. Smith had a sudden onset of unclear speech  face drooping  and difficulty walking  symptoms that lasted more than a few minutes  making his wife call for emergency help. This indicates a possible ischemic stroke  which is the most common type of stroke  comprising 87% of all cases according to American Stroke Association.   V. Hospital Course  Mr. Smith was promptly brought to the ER where further investigations were conducted. The initial assessment revealed an elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg and irregularly irregular pulse  indicative of Atrial Fibrillation (AF). His speech was slurred and a physical examination showed a right-sided facial droop  as well as weakness in the right arm and leg. A brain MRI confirmed the presence of an ischemic stroke.  VI. Summary  Presently  Mr. Smith is under optimal care. His condition validates that African American men over the age of 65  particularly those with pre-existing conditions like hypertension and hyperlipidemia  are at a higher risk for stroke. It is essential to educate such demographics about the importance of regular health check-ups to manage pre-existing diseases and recognize any stroke symptoms early.  Compiling the data obtained from this case and literature  it is essential to emphasize the urgency with which these cases should be managed to save patients' lives and improve their chances of recovery with minimal disability. With a protocol for swift stroke recognition and response  we can further ensure optimal patient outcomes.
Stroke,1,91,Patient Presentation:   Full Name: John Smith Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired schoolteacher  Presentation: The patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 65-year-old African American male  who presented with sudden onset of severe headache  weakness on the right side of the body  difficulty in speaking and loss of balance. He mentions that these symptoms woke him up from sleep and there hasn't been any significant improvement. He has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He also reports being a smoker before his retirement  5 years back.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia approximately 15 years ago and has been on medical management since. However  he mentions periods of not taking medications due to forgetfulness or when feeling symptomatically normal. His last known physician checkup  done 6 months ago  reported uncontrolled hypertension. He has a 20 pack year smoking history before he quit about 5 years back. He denies any significant family history of stroke or heart disease.   Risks Factors and Demographic Representation: According to the American Stroke Association  every year  about 55 000 more women than men have a stroke due to longevity. However  African American men like Mr. Smith are at the highest risk of stroke. CDC states  the risk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for blacks than for whites  and blacks have the highest rate of death due to stroke. Lifestyle factors like smoking  hypertension and hyperlipidemia further elevate Mr. Smith's risk for stroke  and his recent symptomatology indicates the possibility of an acute stroke incident.   In conclusion  Mr Smith's demographic factors and lifestyle place him at an elevated risk for stroke  and his current symptoms warrant immediate medical attention and further diagnostic workup.
Stroke,1,92,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African American male  has presented to the emergency department with symptoms indicative of an acute stroke. He has an existing medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  both of which are risk factors contributing to stroke incidence. He also has a past family history of stroke. According to statistical data  stroke is especially prevalent in individuals over the age of 55  with risk essentially doubling each decade of life after 55 years of age. As an African American  Mr. Johnson belongs to a demographic group that has a significantly higher risk of stroke risk compared to other populations.  Mr. Johnson is a retired engineer  currently living with his wife. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly. Over the past year  he has been proactive in managing his hypertension and diabetes  maintaining regular appointments with his primary care physician and complying with his prescribed medication.  However  he experienced a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking approximately two hours prior to his arrival in the emergency department. He also reported a subsequent severe headache and dizziness. His wife immediately called for emergency medical assistance upon noticing these signs.  This presentation is aligned with cerebrovascular accident or stroke  given his sudden neurological deficits localized to one side of the body and the coexistence of his other reported symptoms. The presence of his risk factors  namely age  race  specific medical conditions (hypertension and diabetes)  and family history  further support the possibility of a stroke event.   In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's case highlights the importance of early recognition and reaction to stroke symptoms for effective treatment  particularly for patients who are at a higher risk due to their demographic or medical history.
Stroke,1,93,Title: Acute Stroke Presentation in an Elderly Patient  Presentation:  Today  we are presenting Mr. Johnson  a 75-year-old African American male with a significant past medical history of hypertension  smoking  uncontrolled diabetes Mellitus and previous transient ischemic attacks (TIA's) who arrived today in the emergency department with a sudden onset of symptoms consistent with a stroke.  The previous population-based epidemiological studies show African American men over the age of 65 are disproportionately affected by stroke  with a higher prevalence of significant risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Mr. Johnson fits into this high-risk demographic as seen in the current literature.  Mr. Johnson  who lives with his son after his wife passed away two years ago  was brought in by his son after noticing that his father suddenly developed difficulty speaking  drooping on the right side of his face and weakness in his right limbs. The time last seen normal was just over an hour ago  which makes him a potential candidate for acute intervention.  The patient’s past medical history is significant. He has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 20 years and type 2 diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years. His son reports he often misses his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications due to forgetfulness. Second  he smoked one pack a day for 30 years and quit 10 years ago. Moreover  he had a TIA about a year ago that self-resolved in less than an hour. He also has a family history of stroke  with his father having suffered a fatal stroke at the age of 72.  On initial assessment  his blood pressure is elevated  blood sugar levels are above normal  and a physical examination has revealed decreased power and decreased sensation on his right side. The initial CT scan results are still pending.   In conclusion  Mr. Johnson  with his advanced age  under-treated hypertension and diabetes  smoking history  and previous TIAs  is a classic case representative of the high stroke risk demographic. He is an example of how critical it is to manage risk factors to reduce stroke incidence in these high-risk individuals effectively.  Future steps will involve acute management  secondary investigation  and long-term stroke prevention strategies. It also highlights the importance of family involvement and health education in managing chronic conditions in elderly patients.
Stroke,1,94,Subject: Presentation of a Stroke Patient  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Sanderson Age: 70 years Sex: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Urban area  New York Marital Status: Married  Chief Complaints: Sudden onset of weakness in the right side of body  difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  experienced for about three hours before being brought to the hospital.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Patient has a 15-year history of hypertension  which is managed by daily medication. 2. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: Diagnosed 10 years ago  patient on metformin and regular insulin injections. 3. History of Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs): Had two episodes in the past 5 years. 4. Previous history of smoking and alcohol: Smoked a pack per day for 30 years  quit 10 years ago. Occasional alcohol consumption. 5. No history of atrial fibrillation or other heart diseases. 6. No history of previous strokes.  Family History:  1. Stroke: Father suffered from stroke at the age of 74. 2. Hypertension: Both parents had hypertension.  Findings on Examination:  The patient is fully conscious  but displays facial droop  slurred speech  and has difficulty in moving the right side of the arm and leg. Initial NIHSS score is 8  indicating moderate stroke. Blood pressure is elevated at 170/90 mmHg.  Conclusion:  Mr. Sanderson is presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke  with right-sided weakness  facial droop and speech difficulties. Given his history of hypertension  diabetes  TIAs  and his race and age which are known risk factors  it is likely that Mr. Sanderson is experiencing stroke. Urgent brain imaging and further evaluation is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.  References:  Given the fact that stroke is more prevalent in African-American populations and higher in males  and the common risk factors include hypertension  diabetes  age above 65  and history of TIAs (Benjamin et al.  2017)  Mr. Sanderson's profile and history are representative of typical stroke patients.

Stroke,1,98,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Stroke  Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Walker  a 68-year-old African American male  presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking. He was brought in by his daughter who noticed these changes when she came to visit him this morning. Mr. Walker  who is retired from a career in journalism  currently lives alone and is active within his community  participating in the local senior's club.  Demographics:  Stroke is highly prevalent in the elderly population and has a higher incidence rate in the African American community. According to the American Stroke Association  African Americans are at almost twice the risk of first-ever stroke as compared to Caucasians. The risk of stroke is also higher in men than women.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Walker has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus. These are all known risk factors for stroke. He is on medication for these conditions flagging an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Mr. Walker quit smoking ten years ago after a two-pack per day habit that lasted for 30 years. He does not consume alcohol.  Physical Examination:  Upon admission  Mr. Walker's vital signs were within normal limits except for slightly elevated blood pressure. He had right-sided facial droop  motor weakness in the right arm and leg  and slurred speech. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 14/15. Both muscle tone and reflexes were reduced on the right side. Sensory examination showed reduced perception of touch and pain on the right side.  Investigations:  A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was ordered immediately which showed early changes suggestive of ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory.   In summary  Mr. Walker  a 68-year-old African American male with significant past medical history risk factors  presents with clinical and radiological features suggestive of left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. His case underscores the increased risk of stroke in individuals with uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidaemia  and a history of smoking  particularly those from high-risk demographics.
Stroke,1,99,Patient Presentation:   Patient Name: Mr. John R. Doe  DOB: 01.21.1950 Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Electrician   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe presented at the Emergency Department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and trouble maintaining balance.  Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes in 2005  which he manages with lifestyle changes and prescribed medications. In 2010  he experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA)  but had no residual symptoms post-recovery. His cholesterol levels have been erratic  slightly above normal ranges at times. His BMI indicates obesity and he has a documented history of cigarette smoking for the past 35 years.  Family History: Mr. Doe's father died from a myocardial infarction aged 65  and his older brother had a stroke at 55.   Review of Systems:  Since the sudden onset of the aforementioned symptoms  Mr. Doe reports no chest pain  no shortness of breath  no confusion  and no severe headache.   This presentation is consistent with the American Heart Association's data  indicating that stroke is more prevalent in older adults  specifically males  and those with pre-existing medical conditions including hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol. As observed in Mr. Doe's case  family history  smoking  and obesity further escalate the risk.   Initial Assessment: Based on symptoms and medical history  the initial assessment is that Mr. Doe is experiencing a stroke. Immediate action is required  considering the potential severity of the situation. We have initiated a stroke alert and the patient will be sent for urgent neuro-imaging to confirm and determine the ischemic or hemorrhagic nature of the stroke. We have with-held food and drink  and performed necessary blood work. We'll keep a close eye on his vitals  and decide upon the most suitable treatment as soon as we get the imaging report.
Stroke,1,100,Title: A Case Presentation of a Stroke Patient   I. Patient Identification  The patient is a 62-year-old African American male named Mr. James Johnson. He was brought to our hospital with complaints of acute onset weakness in his right side and speech disturbances. According to our records  Mr. Johnson is a retired mechanical engineer  now residing in Washington  DC with his wife.   II. Presenting Complaint Mr. Johnson awoke from sleep experiencing sudden difficulty speaking and weakness in his right arm and leg. His wife immediately noticed his slurring speech  drooping mouth  and the limpness in his right arm. Acting promptly  she called an ambulance  suspecting it might be a stroke.  III. Past Medical History Mr. Johnson has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years  for which he is already on antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemic agents  respectively. There is evidence of non-compliance with his prescribed medications. He also had experienced episodes of transient ischemic attacks two years ago. No previously reported drug allergies. He habitually smokes a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and occasionally enjoys beer.   IV. Family History There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away from an ischemic stroke at the age of 68  and his mother is living with chronic heart disease. His elder sister succumbs to a heart attack couple years ago.  V. Social History Mr. Johnson is happily married with three grown-up children. Retired from his job two years ago  he has been living a sedentary lifestyle in recent years due to developing osteoarthritis in his knees.  In summary  Mr. Johnson's profile is typical of many stroke patients. His age  race  male gender  non-compliance with medication  past medical history  associated habits  such as smoking  and strong family history of cardiovascular disease all contribute to his overall increased risk of stroke. This highlights the need for greater attention to managing modifiable risk factors in similar at-risk populations.
Stroke,2,1,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Lee is a 68-year-old Asian male who presents in the Emergency Department via ambulance with symptoms consistent with an acute cerebrovascular event. He was found by his wife at home with difficulty speaking and sudden onset weakness in his right arm and leg.  Demographics:  According to US census data and stroke prevalence studies  the patient's age  sex  and ethnicity align with known demographic risk factors for this pathological condition. Stroke is especially common among elderly individuals  particularly those above 65 years. Statistics indicate that Asian Americans  particularly older men  suffer from a disproportionate burden of stroke as compared to other racial and ethnic groups.  Past Medical History:  Significant elements of Mr. Lee's past medical history include uncontrolled type II diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a previous episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) roughly five years earlier. He is a 40-pack year smoker but quit smoking a decade ago. His father died of a stroke at the age of 72. His medications include Losartan  Metformin  and Simvastatin.   Additionally  Mr. Lee's wife reports that he has not been compliant with his antihypertensive medication and regular health check-ups  putting him at further risk for recurrent cerebrovascular accidents. These known comorbidities significantly influence this patient's clinical presentation. 
Stroke,2,2,Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old African American male  presents with sudden onset of left-sided facial droop  left-sided arm weakness  and slurred speech.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus 6 years ago  for which he is under oral medication. He also has a history of hypertension  managed with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive drugs for the past 10 years. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack-year smoking history but quit about 10 years ago.   Presenting Complaints: He reports that while he was having breakfast with his wife today morning around 9:00 AM  he suddenly felt a 'numbness' move from his left cheek down to his left arm within a span of a few seconds. His grip weakened and he involuntarily dropped the coffee mug he was holding. His wife noticed that his speech was slurred and his face seemed to be 'drooping' on one side.   Mr. Smith denies any complaint of a headache or vertigo preceding or during the onset of these symptoms. He has not had any loss of consciousness  seizures  or memory loss. His current symptoms have persisted and not improved or worsened since onset.  Please Note: This is a hypothetical scenario and does not represent any specific individual or population. This scenario is designed to be indicative of a typical patient presenting with stroke symptoms. The demographic representation draws from general statistical data that suggest that stroke risk increases with age  has a higher prevalence in the African American population  and is associated with conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and smoking history.
Stroke,2,3,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Roberts Age: 70-year-old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired general contractor  Presenting Problem: Mr. Roberts presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech that started around two hours ago while he was reading a newspaper.  Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Both conditions are generally well managed with medication. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but he smoked a pack a day for 40 years. He was hospitalized for myocardial infarction five years ago. He has been compliant with medications and follow-ups pertaining to his conditions.  Family History: His father died of stroke at the age of 73. His mother had a long history of hypertension and died due to heart failure at the age of 80.  Social History: Mr. Roberts is a widower who lives alone. He has two adult children and three grandchildren. He is generally active and spends his time reading  woodworking  and gardening. He reports consuming alcohol socially  mostly on weekends.  Review of Systems: Grossly normal except for the recent onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech.   Initial Assessment: He appears alert but anxious. Vital signs are stable. He exhibits clear facial drooping on the right side  has difficulty raising his right arm  and his speech is slurred. These symptoms indicate a possible left-sided ischemic stroke.   Given his age  gender  race  and history of hypertension  diabetes and previous cardiovascular disease  Mr. Roberts indeed falls into the high-risk category for stroke. He has been advised immediate medical attention including diagnostic imaging tests and possible thrombolytic therapy  depending on further evaluation and contraindications. A neurology consult has been requested.
Stroke,2,4,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Sara Johnson is a 68-year-old African American female  who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with her daughter  complaining of sudden onset unilateral weakness  speech difficulty  and blurred vision which occurred several hours ago. She denies any headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  or other neurological symptoms. She has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are being managed with medications  but with sub-optimal compliance as evidenced by recent elevated blood pressure and HbA1c levels. She is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or illicit drug use. She lives with her daughter  who reports her mother has been looking 'unsteady' and 'confused' for a few days leading up to today’s acute symptoms. No family history of stroke was reported  but her parents had cardiovascular diseases. Her last check-up with her primary care physician was 2 months back.   Upon examination in the ED triage  Ms. Johnson was found to be hypertensive (BP:165/95mmHg) with a reduced level of consciousness (GCS:13/15). She exhibited facial droop on her left side  left-sided limb weakness with a strength score of 3/5  and slightly slurred speech  all of which were consistent with a right-hemispheric stroke. Urgent neuro-imaging was ordered after normal coagulation profiles.
Stroke,2,5,Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Maria Rodriguez Age: 67 Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired Teacher  Presenting Issue: Mrs. Rodriguez was brought in by her daughter reporting sudden onset of symptoms an hour ago at their residence. The daughter noticed that her mother had difficulty speaking  her face appeared drooped on one side and she was unable to lift her right arm.   Medical History: Mrs. Rodriguez has a noted medical history of hypertension (diagnosed ten years ago)  type 2 diabetes (diagnosed seven years ago)  and hyperlipidemia (diagnosed five years ago). All these conditions are reportedly under control with prescribed medications - Lisinopril for hypertension  Metformin for diabetes  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She has no history of prior strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)  and denies any smoking or alcohol use. Her father had a stroke at the age of 72. She has been compliant with her medications and regularly follows up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP). Her last HbA1c was 6.2% and BP reading in the clinic was 140/85 mm Hg.  Current Medications: 1. Lisinopril 20mg daily 2. Metformin 500mg twice daily 3. Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime  Given her symptoms of facial droop  arm weakness  and speech difficulty  together with her background of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  she is highly suspected of having an acute ischemic stroke. Immediate evaluation and management is crucial to limit brain damage and potential complications  following the stroke protocols and possible thrombolytic treatment. 
Stroke,2,6,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Sanchez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the hospital with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started approximately 1.5 hours prior when he was at home watching television. He reports he felt completely normal before this episode and denies any recent sickness or injury.  His past medical history includes hypertension  for which he takes Losartan 50 mg daily  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that has been controlled with Metformin for 15 years. Mr. Sanchez had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  resulting in the placement of two stents. He quit smoking after the event but has a 25-pack year history prior to quitting. He drinks alcohol socially  approximately once or twice each month.  His family history is significant for a father who had recurrent ischemic strokes in his mid-70s. Mr. Sanchez is also on daily Aspirin (81 mg) for secondary cardiovascular prevention and Simvastatin 40 mg for hyperlipidemia. On his last check-up 6 months ago  his lipid profile  renal function  and blood glucose were within normal limits. He has not had any complaints of angina  dyspnea  or any other cardiovascular issues since his heart attack.  Mr. Sanchez lives with his wife in their two-story house  where he fell from his chair after the sudden onset of his symptoms. His wife reports that he did not lose consciousness  but he appeared disoriented and was unable to articulate his words. After being spotted by his wife and unable to walk or talk  the emergency medical services were immediately contacted.  Given the patient's age  race  and history of hypertension  diabetes  and ischemic heart disease  he fits the common demographic profile for a stroke victim as found in literature.
Stroke,2,7,Patient Introduction: Mrs. Anna Smith  a 72-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department via ambulance.   Chief Complaint: She complains of a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in talking which began approximately 2 hours ago.  History of Present Illness: Mrs. Smith was at her church meeting this morning when she suddenly fell down due to weakness in her right arm and leg. Her friends also noticed that her speech was slurred. The issues did not resolve and an ambulance was called immediately.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith is known to have hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  for which she is taking medication (Metformin for Diabetes and Lisinopril for Hypertension). She was a smoker  but quit smoking five years back. She has no known allergies.  Review of Systems: For the past 6 months  Mrs. Smith has reported intermittent episodes of headache  vertigo  and mild memory losses. However  these symptoms were polyphasic  inconsistent  and have never been severe enough to debilitate her usual routines.  Social History: Mrs. Smith lives with her husband. She enjoys gardening and is an active member of her local community church group. She denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  Family History: Her father died of a heart attack at the age of 66  and her mother had a history of stroke. She has one brother who has been diagnosed with hypertension.  This patient's presentation and demographic factors point towards a potential stroke. Age  African-American ancestry  hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of vascular diseases are significant risk factors. The sudden onset of symptoms typical of stroke (right-sided weakness and slurred speech) further consolidate this suspicion. Prompt diagnostic imaging and neurology consultation are imperative for diagnosis confirmation and subsequent management.
Stroke,2,8,Patient Presentation:  Mr. De Sousa is a 65-year-old African-American male presenting today with sudden onset left-sided weakness  problem with speaking and understanding  severe headache  trouble seeing and loss of balance. Symptoms began approximately 2 hours prior to presentation.  The patient's past medical history is characterized by well-controlled hypertension  poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. The patient is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history but quit a year ago. His father died of a stroke at 82 years old and his mother suffered from a myocardial infarction in her late seventies. Mr. De Sousa admits that he sporadically checks his blood glucose levels and doesn't always remember to take his daily medications consistently  which include Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. He does not have any known drug allergies.  At home  Mr. De Sousa lives with his wife. He was a mechanic before retirement but is currently unemployed due to his worsening diabetes and vision impairment. He indicates he regularly consumes alcohol  approximating about three servings of liquor daily  and doesn’t exercise regularly.  Note: The case presentation is designed to reflect statistical trends seen within stroke patients  such as being more common in older populations  high frequency in African-Americans  and being often associated with underlying conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia.
Stroke,2,9,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alvarez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents at the emergency department with acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking that started approximately 2 hours ago. He also reports blurry vision in his right eye and faintness as primary symptoms.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Alvarez has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He is cognizant and cooperative and his vitals on arrival are stable. He admits to not taking his medications regularly and also has a history of smoking for the past 20 years but quit smoking 5 years ago. Patient denies any significant family history of stroke. In this instance  Mr. Alvarez's primary risk factors for stroke are his age  Hispanic ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and past smoking history.  Current Medications:  Metformin 500mg twice daily for his diabetes  Lisinopril 10mg daily for his hypertension  and Atorvastatin 10mg daily for dyslipidemia.   Allergies:   No known drug allergies.   Relevant Findings:  On examination  he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 12 indicative of moderate severity. There are no other abnormal findings.   The patient's clinical signs and symptoms  medical history and physical examination findings are suggestive of acute ischemic stroke.   His prior history suggests he has several risk factors that have been associated with ischemic stroke including medical history of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia and past history of tobacco use. Therefore  urgent neuroimaging is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess eligibility for thrombolytic treatment.
Stroke,2,10,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old African-American female presents to the emergency department. She reports noticing a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and facial droop that started approximately two and a half hours ago while she was cooking. She also reported a difficulty in speech which was noticed by her daughter. She denies any headache  trauma  visual changes  loss of consciousness or confusion.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She quit smoking 3 years ago after a 30-year habit. She lives with her daughter and is mostly independent with activities of daily living aside from requiring assistance with administering her insulin injections.   She is currently taking Metformin for her diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for her hyperlipidemia. Her latest hemoglobin A1C was 7.2% and blood pressure was 142/86 mmHg at her last clinic appointment a month ago.  On neurological examination  she has facial droop on the right side with significant right arm and leg weakness. Speech was slurred with some difficulty understanding written and verbal commands. Rest of her physical examination was unremarkable. Her vitals show blood pressure of 154/92 mmHg  heart rate 88 beats/min  temperature 98.4 deg F  respiratory rate 16 per min  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. She was promptly taken for a non-contrast CT scan to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke.  (Note: The above patient presentation is an example. Stroke presentation  risk factors  and demographics can significantly vary per individual case depending on multiple factors. African Americans are more likely to have a stroke than any other racial group and women have a higher stroke risk than men but it's important to note that strokes can affect anyone irrespective of age  gender  or race.)
Stroke,2,11,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  who arrived at the emergency department accompanied by his daughter. He presents with sudden onset right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking which began approximately 2 hours prior to arrival as per information shared by his daughter  with no witnessed seizure  fever  trauma  or known history of recent travel.  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension managed with Losartan  type 2 diabetes controlled through Metformin  and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes atorvastatin. He is a former smoker  with a 30-pack year history and he quit smoking 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and has no known drug allergies.  On physical examination  he appears anxious. His blood pressure is 170/95 mmHg  pulse rate 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 97% on room air  and temperature 98.6°F. He is conscious and alert  but his speech is slurred. He demonstrates right facial droop and right sided body weakness.   A score of 12 on the NIH Stroke Scale assessment corroborates the presence of a significant impairment. Initial laboratory results including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel are within normal range. His HbA1c is 7.2%.  A CT Brain without contrast was done immediately which ruled out hemorrhage. The findings of history  examination and investigations indicate Mr. Smith is currently experiencing an acute ischemic stroke.
Stroke,2,12,Patient Presentation: Ms. Patricia Alvarez  a 68-year-old Hispanic woman  came into the emergency room with abrupt onset slurred speech  right-sided weakness and vision problems that began approximately 90 minutes ago. She was brought by her son who found her with these symptoms at home after returning from work.  Review of systems is significant for hypertension and high cholesterol which were detected during her regular check-ups  but she has been non-compliant with her antihypertensive and statin medications lately. She has no history of diabetes  heart disease or any previous strokes. She does not smoke  but occasionally drinks alcohol. She had difficulties in maintaining a regular exercise regimen and is also currently overweight. Her family history is relevant for stroke in her mother and coronary artery disease in her father. She experiences severe headaches occasionally.  On physical examination  her blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg and her pulse is regular but elevated at 95 beats per minute. She appears oriented to person  place  and date. Neurologic assessment shows expressive aphasia with drooping at the right corner of her mouth and a decreased strength in her right upper and lower extremities. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation  though she reports decreased peripheral vision on her right side. Remainder of the examination is unremarkable.   Given this symptomatology and her background of untreated hypertension and dyslipidemia  an ischemic stroke is suspected and would need immediate attention.
Stroke,2,13,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Anderson  a 67-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with acute onset weakness on the right side of his body  accompanied by slurred speech that began approximately 50 minutes before arrival. He was brought in by his wife who noticed the sudden change in his strength and speech. He is alert and oriented but clearly distressed.  Mr. Anderson has a documented past medical history significant with his being a chronic smoker for the last 25 years and having hypertension for 10 years. He acknowledges being non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication recently. He has no known history of diabetes  heart diseases or any other neurological conditions.  Family history is remarkable for a father who died of a stroke at an older age.  His vitals upon arrival: Blood Pressure 160/95 mmHg  Heart Rate 90 beats per minute  Temperature 98.6 F  Respiratory Rate 18 breaths per minute  Oxygen Saturation 98% on room air.  Preliminary physical examination findings include decreased strength in the right upper and lower extremities  facial droop on the right side  and slurred speech. Other systems do not show any significant abnormalities.  Mr. Anderson's presentation is strongly indicative of stroke. He falls into a high-risk demographic for stroke  being over the age of 65 and him being African-American. Coupling this with his medical history of hypertension and chronic smoking  his non-compliance to medication  and a relevant family history  culminate in a high suspicion for an ischemic stroke. Immediate interventions and diagnostic investigations are being ordered.
Stroke,2,14,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Johnson  a 70-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department exhibiting symptoms of acute onset of right-sided weakness  aphasia  and altered consciousness. He is right-handed. His daughter  who accompanied him  reported that he had suddenly developed slurred speech  trouble walking  and was unable to control his right arm approximately 2 hours before presentation.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been managing it with therapy. His records also indicate a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed by diet and metformin. He is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia  for which he takes atorvastatin. His family history reveals significant cardiovascular disease  including a stroke suffered by his late mother.   Current Medications:  1. Metformin 500 mg twice a day for type 2 diabetes.  2. Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day for hyperlipidemia. 3. Losartan 50 mg once a day for hypertension.  Allergies: No known allergies  Lifestyle Choices: Patient has a sedentary lifestyle  typical diet includes high salt and high sugar foods.   Demographics: The patient is a retired electrician  reasonable English proficiency  widower with two adult children who live nearby. Lives independently in urban residential community  has Medicare coverage.   Given Mr. Johnson's age  race  gender  and medical history  he is at an increased risk of suffering from a stroke. His actual condition matches this risk profile  as African Americans are at a higher risk of stroke in comparison to other racial groups  and his medical history points to multiple risk factors  including hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia.
Stroke,2,15,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Johnson  a 72-year-old African American woman  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of slurred speech  right-side facial droop  and right-sided weakness. Ms. Johnson was brought in by her daughter who stated that her mother was perfectly fine when they were having breakfast together  but she suddenly started speaking incoherently about an hour later  which was when they decided to bring her to the ED. Ms. Johnson has a medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are reportedly well controlled according to the daughter. Ms. Johnson is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She is independent with activities of daily living and usually quite active. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. The patient's maternal grandmother suffered a stroke at around 70 years old. Ms. Johnson’s current medication list includes Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. Symptoms started approximately 1 hour ago and there has been no recent history of trauma or injury. There were no other significant findings from the review of systems. On examination  she showed signs of a right-sided facial droop  slurred speech  and right upper limb weakness.  Note: This presentation aims to take into account accurate demographic representation as per literature  which indicates higher stroke risk in elderly individuals  African Americans  and those with hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of strokes.
Stroke,2,16,Patient Presentation  Mr. James Scott is a 68-year-old African-American male presenting to the emergency department. He notably has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes  and smokes a pack a day. He has been compliant with his medication  but his blood pressure readings have been consistently raised over the past few months.  Today  he was found on the floor by his wife at around 8am  approximately 10 minutes before arriving at the hospital. She reported that he seemed fine when he woke up but became suddenly weak on the right side of his body. He also had difficulty speaking  his words were slurred  and he was having trouble understanding her. She denied any recent head trauma  headache  seizure  or change in consciousness.   His vitals on arrival were BP: 190/95 mmHg  Pulse: 88  RR: 20  Temp: 98.6 F  and SpO2: 96% on room air. Physical examination shows right-sided facial drooping  slurred speech  right-sided hemiparesis  and disorientation to time and place. No signs of trauma or other injury were noted.  Due to his sudden onset of symptoms and risk factors  an acute ischemic stroke is strongly suspected. His last seen normal time is around 7.30am  putting him within the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy if further investigation confirms the diagnosis.  He will be undergoing urgent neuroimaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and start on Stroke protocol as per the hospital's guidelines.
Stroke,2,17,Patient Presentation:   A 65-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  presents to the ER with an acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began roughly an hour ago. His wife  who is his caregiver  reports that she suddenly noticed him slurred speech  a drooping face on one side  and difficulty moving his right hand while having breakfast. She says he seemed unaware of the weakness but appeared disoriented and anxious. She adds  he's been less active recently but states he hasn't complained about any dizziness  numbness  tingling  or vision changes.   Past Medical History:   He previously worked in construction and has been a heavy smoker  smoking around one pack of cigarettes per day since his 20s. He has a 10-year diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension  both of which have not been well controlled despite being prescribed metformin for diabetes and losartan for hypertension. He reportedly doesn't follow his medication regime well and lacks consistent follow-up appointments. There is no history of heart disease in the patient himself  but his father had a myocardial infarction at age 60. The patient denies excessive alcohol use or illicit drug use.  Demographic Background:  The patient is a resident of a suburban town. He is married  with two adult children. He completed high school and worked in a demanding physical job before retirement. He has Medicare insurance coverage. He and his wife live independently but have limited access to healthcare services due to transportation barriers.
Stroke,2,18,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Smith  a 68-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department via ambulance. He has a chief complaint of a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech that started about 2 hours ago while he was having breakfast. His spouse who was around him at the time of onset reports that he suddenly could not move the right side of his body and his speech became slurred.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  type-2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and a 10-year history of tobacco smoking. He has been compliant with his antihypertensive medicine (Lisinopril)  statin (Simvastatin)  and oral hypoglycaemic agent (Metformin). However  he has had challenges with maintaining a healthy diet and adequate physical activity. As per his spouse  he hasn't experienced similar symptoms before.  He is married  retired  and lives with his wife. He quit smoking approximately 3 months ago and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. On examination  he appears anxious. His blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg  pulse rate is 88 beats/minute  respiratory rate is 16 breaths/minute   temperature is 98.6°F/37°C  and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  Neurological examination reveals that he is awake and alert but has slurred speech. His pupils are equal and react to light. He is unable to lift his right arm off the bed or move his right leg. His facial smile is asymmetrical with a droop on the right side. His reflexes are diminished on the right side. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  This patient presentation highlights a likely ischemic stroke requiring immediate evaluation and management.
Stroke,2,19,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Ahmed Khan is a 60-year-old South Asian man who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of blurred vision and unilateral weakness on his right side. He reports these symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago when he was at home watching television. He describes feeling a sudden loss of strength and coordination in his right arm and difficulty seeing clearly in his right visual field. He stands at 5'6"""" and weighs about 70 kgs.   His vital signs on arrival are as follows: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 88 bpm  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  temperature 98.7 F and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  Mr. Khan's past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both currently managed on medication for the past 20 years. He is a reformed smoker with a 30-pack year history  having quit approximately 10 years ago. He does not consume alcohol. His father suffered from a stroke at the age of 65.  For medications  Mr. Khan takes Metformin 500mg twice daily for his diabetes and Losartan 50mg daily for his hypertension. The patient does not report any known drug allergies.  His diabetic control is suboptimal  with a recent HbA1c of 7.9%. His lipids were found to be elevated on routine bloods done by his GP three months ago with a total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl.  From the clinical presentation and past medical history  a working diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke is suspected  and neuroimaging is urgently being arranged by the ER physician.  REPRESENTATION RATIONALE:  As per literature  the incidence of stroke is higher among men than women. Certain ethnicities like African American  Hispanics  and South Asians have a higher risk for stroke than Caucasians. The presence of hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  and a family history of stroke increases the risk further. Older age and past smoking history also contribute toward stroke propensity."

Stroke,2,22,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Miller is a 69-year-old African American female who presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech for an hour before arrival. She was last well approximately 2 hours ago when her family noticed the changes in her behavior.   She is reported to have a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which she takes Lisinopril  Simvastatin  and Metformin  respectively. She had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago. She quit smoking ten years ago  but she had smoked approximately 1 pack per day for over 40 years. There is no history of alcohol or substance abuse  and she lives with her husband who is her primary caregiver.  On examination  she is alert and oriented to person and place but not time  with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 12. She exhibits dysarthria  left-sided facial droop  and profound left-sided hemiparesis. Prompt evaluation with non-contrast brain CT scan is recommended  and arrangements are made for possible intravenous thrombolysis.  This patient presentation is representative of a typical demographic as studies suggest that the risk of stroke is higher among older adults  African American individuals  people with a personal or family history of stroke  and those with certain medical comorbidities including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. The use of alcohol and tobacco also increases the risk.
Stroke,2,23,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Maria Garcia  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the emergency department with her daughter  who reports that earlier today  Mrs. Garcia suddenly developed slurred speech  weakness on the right side of her body  and was unable to maintain her balance. These are the patient's chief complaints upon arrival.   The patient has had hypertension for the last ten years which she usually controls with her prescribed antihypertensive medication  Lisinopril. Her compliance to medication is excellent as per her daughter. In addition to hypertension  she also has type 2 diabetes mellitus  which she manages with Metformin  and has hyperlipidemia for which she takes Simvastatin.   She has never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally. She does not have any known drug allergies. Her mother died of a massive stroke at 74. Mrs. Garcia lives with her husband and granddaughter in their own home and she has been independent in her activities of daily living before the current episode.   On examination  her BMI is computed to be 27  indicating she is overweight. Her blood pressure at arrival is 160/95 mmHg  elevated compared to her usual readings. The patient's blood sugar level is slightly elevated at 170 mg/dl.  This clinical picture along with the sudden onset of symptoms suggests a possible stroke event.  The team initiates a stroke alert and proceeds with further investigations as per the stroke protocol including a non-contrast CT scan of the head.
Stroke,2,24,"Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 63-year-old African-American male presenting to the emergency department with slurred speech  right-sided facial droop  and right arm weakness. Symptoms started suddenly approximately 1 hour ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which have been managed with Lisinopril and Metformin respectively  for over 10 years. He is a former smoker who quit 5 years ago but has a 15-pack-year smoking history. He has no known drug allergies.   Social History: The patient is a retired teacher who lives with his wife. He has a poor dietary habit with a preference for high-fat foods and sodas but has been non-alcoholic for the last 25 years.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 65  and his mother died of heart complications at the age of 68. His older brother is alive with no known medical conditions.  Review of Systems: The patient denies headache  chest pain  difficulty swallowing  vision changes  loss of balance  shortness of breath  or changes in mental state. He admits to having felt """"off"""" today but unable to specify further.  Physical Examination: Vital signs are Blood Pressure of 165/95  Pulse 80  Respiratory rate 20  and temperature 98.6°F. Neurological examination reveals right-sided facial droop  dysarthria  and motor weakness in the right upper and lower extremities. He has a negative Babinski reflex on the left but a positive one on the right. The rest of the physical exam is within normal limits.  Assessment and Plan:  The patient’s symptoms of sudden unilateral facial droop  slurred speech  and arm weakness are suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. This hypothesis is supported by his underlying risk factors of hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and family history of stroke. Immediate further investigations such as urgent non-contrast CT Brain must be initiated to rule out hemorrhage and then possibly proceed with thrombolytic treatment if within the window period and following contraindications evaluation. Consultant Neurologist opinion should be sought. Patient’s blood pressure control and diabetes management should be evaluated and optimized during admission."
Stroke,2,25,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Russo  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  presents today to the emergency department after her daughter found her in a state of confusion earlier this morning. The patient was having difficulty moving her left arm and leg  with mild slurred speech but no problems with awareness or consciousness. Her daughter also reported that Ms. Russo seemed to lose balance for a short period  prompting her to call for an ambulance.  Her medical history points to a diagnosis of Hypertension for the past 10 years  which has been fairly controlled with Amlodipine 5mg daily. She also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago  which is well-controlled with diet and Metformin. About 3 years ago  Ms. Russo was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation for which she is on life-long anticoagulation with Warfarin.   Ms. Russo quit smoking about a decade ago  having been a pack-a-day smoker for nearly 40 years. She consumes alcohol occasionally and has no known drug allergies. There's a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  with her father and two elder brothers having died from myocardial infarction.  Currently  she lives with her daughter and grandson and is otherwise functional and independent for activities of daily living. Her last normal  as reported by her daughter  was approximately ten hours ago. Given her symptoms and past medical history  these findings highly suggest a stroke  and timely medical intervention is warranted. 
Stroke,2,26,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Agustín Rivera is a 68-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and imbalance while walking. The symptoms started approximately two hours ago while he was at home watching television. He denies having any headache  trauma or loss of consciousness.  Mr. Rivera has a significant past medical history for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and atrial fibrillation  for which he is on medications- Lisinopril  Metformin  and Warfarin respectively. He reports compliance with his medications. He has been a tobacco smoker for the past 40 years but denies any alcohol or illicit drug usage.  His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 75 beats per minute and irregular  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 98.6 °F. On physical examination  he has left-sided facial droop  muffled speech  left-sided weakness in both upper and lower extremities  and impaired coordination on the left side.  The presentation suggested a potential ischemic stroke  so a non-contrast CT scan of his head was immediately ordered.  Mr. Rivera's ethnicity  age  and significant comorbid conditions increase his risk for stroke. According to CDC data  stroke is more common and deadlier in Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites  and patients with hypertension  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk for stroke.
Stroke,2,27,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Robertson is a 68-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with his wife. The onset of symptoms occurred approximately 2 hours ago when he developed sudden weakness on the left side of his body  slurred speech and appeared confused. His wife also reports that he lost his balance momentarily.  Past Medical History:  He has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed by medication (Lisinopril and Metformin respectively). He also has hyperlipidemia for which he takes a daily statin. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 8 years ago. There is also a family history of cerebrovascular diseases; his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 70.  Vitals on Presentation:  Heart rate is 88 bpm  blood pressure is 170/90 mmHg  respirations are 16 per minute  and his body temperature is 98.6°F. His oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.  Assessment:  On physical examination  he appeared awake but was unable to express himself clearly. He has left-sided facial droop  difficulty swallowing  left arm drift and left leg weakness.   Risk Factors:  Hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  personal history of smoking  family history of stroke. Given his African American ethnicity  he may also be more predisposed to stroke based on epidemiological data.  Relevant Labs:  Blood glucose level to evaluate for hyperglycemia  lipid profile to evaluate for dyslipidemia  and a coagulation profile to identify any potential clotting abnormalities. His EKG shows no signs of acute myocardial infarction.  Imaging:  He was promptly taken for a non-contrast CT scan of the head  which confirmed the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke with no signs of intracerebral hemorrhage.   Treatment Plan:  The patient was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. As the patient presented within the therapeutic window  he was treated with IV thrombolysis. Antiplatelet therapy was started post-thrombolysis. His hypertension and diabetes will need to be more aggressively managed to prevent future strokes. After stabilization  Mr. Robertson will be referred to physical therapy for rehabilitation of the affected limbs. It is also recommended that he sees a dietitian for education on a healthy diet to control his type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. 
Stroke,2,28,Patient Presentation:   Mr. James Williams is a 67-year-old African American male who presented at the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that started roughly four hours prior to arrival. The symptoms were noticed by his wife when he developed a speech disturbance during their dinner.   Past Medical History (PMHx):   He has a medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes medication regularly. He is a former smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago. He admits to occasionally consuming alcohol. He has no known allergies.   Family History (FHx):  He has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at 70 years old and his older brother had a stroke at 72 years old.   Review of Systems (ROS):  He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. He denies any nausea  vomiting  diarrhea or any other gastrointestinal complaints. He reports no change in vision or headache prior to symptom onset.  Physical Examination:  His vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure - 160/90 mmHg  Pulse rate - 78 beats per minute  Respiratory rate - 18 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation - 97% on room air  Temperature - 37-degree celsius.   On neurological examination  he has expressive aphasia and motor examination reveals right-sided hemiparesis with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 8. Pupils are equal  round  and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact.   Given his classic presentation with risk factors (age  race  HTN  DM  and family history)  he is suspected of having an ischemic stroke. An urgent neurology consult  stroke protocol with non-contrast CT scan of head and further diagnostic work up was requested in ED.  The above presentation does take into account the demographic representation of stroke patients where the prevalence and mortality rates are significantly higher among African Americans than Caucasians  with men slightly more affected than women. The risk increases with age and the mentioned comorbidities are considered major risk factors for stroke.  [Note: This case scenario is for educational purposes and does not refer to any real patient.]
Stroke,2,29,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Gonzalez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with symptoms of acute stroke. He arrived via ambulance following the sudden onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulty approximately two hours ago. He denies head injury  fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath. His wife notes he has seemed increasingly forgetful over the past few months but otherwise maintains a steady level of activity.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Gonzalez has a known history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also has hyperlipidemia and a 15-year history of smoking  albeit he quit about five years ago. His medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. There is no known history of stroke  heart disease  or other neurological disorders in the family. His father died at the age of 68 from a stroke  and his mother has a history of heart disease. He consumes alcohol socially  denied illicit drug use  and has no known allergies.  This scenario reflects the reality that Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely to suffer from strokes compared to the general population. Moreover  Hispanics and blacks are more likely to have risk factors for strokes  such as hypertension and diabetes  contributing to their increased risk.
Stroke,2,30,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. J.O. is a 78-year-old African-American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  facial droop  and slurred speech for the past three hours. The patient also reports difficulty in understanding speech and finding the right words when he tries to speak.  Patient was doing his usual activities at home when symptoms began suddenly. No associated headache  seizures  loss of consciousness or trauma. The patient was brought in by his daughter who noticed his speech becoming slurred and his inability to lift his right arm.   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  patient is on lisinopril but reports """"occasional skips"""" when asymptomatic. 2. Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago  under control with metformin. Last known HbA1c was 7.5% six months ago. 3. Hyperlipidemia diagnosed 5 years ago  inconsistent with taking atorvastatin.  Social History:  The patient is a retired schoolteacher who lives with his daughter’s family. He quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol socially.  Review of Systems:  Negative for fever  headache  vision changes  chest pain  shortness of breath  abdominal pain  difficulty swallowing  and changes in bowel or bladder function.  On examination  he shows a right-sided facial droop  expressive aphasia  and right arm and leg weakness. His blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg  heart rate is 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  Investigations indicate hyperglycemia with a blood glucose of 150mg/dl and further imaging with a non-contrast CT Head is ordered following protocol.  This clinical presentation suggests an acute ischemic stroke  and the patient’s age  race  and history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia increase his risk for cerebral vascular disease. His symptoms of aphasia and right-sided weakness suggest a potential left hemisphere stroke."
Stroke,2,31,Patient Presentation:  Dorothy Williams  a 68-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department escorted by her adult daughter. Her daughter reports the onset of sudden right-sided weakness and slurred speech experienced by the patient approximately one hour ago. She also noticed that her mother's face appeared asymmetrical  apparently drooping on the right side. Dorothy denies any recent head trauma  but she conveys feeling a sudden severe headache at the onset of the symptoms.  Mrs. Williams has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been taking Metformin 500mg twice daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily  but her blood pressure has not been well controlled in the recent months  despite adherence to the medication. She has a known allergy to Penicillin  which causes skin rashes. Her family history includes her deceased father who had a stroke at age 72.  On examination  Mrs. Williams is alert but anxious and she appears in mild distress due to her symptoms. Her vitals are within normal range except BP  which is elevated at 160/95 mmHg. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are normal. Neurological examination reveals right facial droop  and significant weakness in the right upper and lower extremities  with a power of 2/5. Her speech is slurred  but she is oriented to time  place  and person.  Given the sudden onset of these symptoms  she has been diagnosed with a suspected stroke and has been rushed to the stroke unit for immediate medical attention and further imaging diagnostics.
Stroke,2,32,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with his wife. His wife reported that her husband suddenly developed difficulty speaking and was unable to move his right arm which started an hour ago. She also mentioned that he complained of a severe headache. Mr. Rodriguez has a history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. His mother had a stroke at an older age.  Upon physical examination  the patient's speech was slurred (dysarthria)  and there was noticeable drooping of the right side of his face. Neurological examination was significant for right-sided hemiparesis. Blood pressure upon arrival was 198/110 mmHg  pulse rate 92 bpm  and blood sugar was noted to be 220 mg/dl.  The patient is a retired engineer  married with 3 grown-up children. He quit smoking 5 years ago but has a 15 pack-year smoking history. His medications are Metformin 500mg twice a day for diabetes  Lisinopril 20mg once a day for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime for hyperlipidemia.  Mr. Rodriguez immigrated from Mexico 30 years ago. He is compliant with his medications but has a low activity level and high-salt  high-fat diet as per history taken from his wife.  Given the sudden onset of his symptoms and his cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk factors  a stroke  possibly ischemic  was suspected. Emergency CT scan was immediately ordered.
Stroke,2,33,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 70-year-old  left-hand dominant  African-American male  brought in by his daughter who found him at home with difficulties in speaking and moving his right arm. The patient reports he woke up with these symptoms this morning  approximately four hours ago. Mr. Smith denies experiencing any headache  seizure  loss of consciousness or trauma. He states he had device implanted several years ago but unsure of the details.  Vital signs are within normal limits with a somewhat increased blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg  which he attributes to not taking his antihypertensive medication  Lisinopril consistently for the past two weeks due to running out and forgetting to refill. His height is recorded as 5'7"""" and weight as 86 kg  indicating he is overweight.  Past Medical History (PMH) is significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with Metformin  hypertension (HTN)  and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) for which he is on Warfarin. He also has a pacemaker which was implanted five years ago  for sick sinus syndrome. He is an ex-smoker  quit 10 years ago  but continues to consume alcohol socially.   Family history reveals that his father had a stroke in old age and his mother had T2DM and HTN. Mr. Smith has two daughters all in good health.   Thorough neurologic examination reveals expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis  consistent with a clinical diagnosis of an acute left MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) stroke. The remaining examination is unremarkable.  It is clear that the patient's multiple risk factors  namely his African-American ethnicity  age  gender  T2DM  HTN  AF  alcohol habits  inconsistent medication adherence and family history of stroke  have contributed to his acute presentation. The pacemaker may indicate the presence of underlying heart disease  and further investigation is required to confirm the presence and manage accordingly. Emergency neuro-imaging is advised to confirm the clinical suspicion of stroke and guide acute management."

According to the son  Mr. Kumar has never experienced these symptoms before.  Mr. Kumar is known to have hypertension and diabetes for which he has been taking medications for the past 10 years. He has a 35-year history of moderate smoking  averaging about a pack of cigarettes daily and he confessed he quit smoking upon diagnosis of hypertension 10 years ago. He enjoys light alcohol consumption  typically drinking a glass of red wine with dinner. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and elder brother dying of heart attacks in their early 70s.  In the ED  Mr. Kumar appeared conscious and oriented but had difficulty communicating due to speech impairment. His vitals were stable; blood pressure recorded was slightly elevated at 145/90 mmHg. On neurological examination  he presented with right-sided hemiplegia and moderate expressive aphasia. His right-sided upper and lower limbs showed 2/5 power with clumsy coordination. He also had slightly droopy facial muscles on the right side when asked to smile. He had no vision changes or swallowing difficulties.   The symptoms started when he woke up in the morning similar to 'wake up stroke'. Based on the above presentation and symptom onset more than 60 minutes ago  an immediate CT scan was ordered to distinguish between ischaemic and hemorrhagic stroke. His son has given consent and staying with him until other family members arrive.
Stroke,2,40,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Delores Payne  a 72-year-old African American woman  presents to the emergency department accompanied by her daughter. She was found speaking incoherently  with drooping on the right side of the face and she was having difficulty moving her right arm and leg when trying to get up from her chair.  Her daughter immediately called an ambulance  noting that these symptoms developed suddenly with a timeline of approximately 90 minutes. Ms. Payne has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medications  including hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin.   Family history is significant for stroke in her mother at age 68. Ms. Payne quit smoking 20 years ago  and she takes a daily aspirin as recommended by her primary care doctor. She is a retired school teacher  widowed  living with her single daughter. Her last medical checkup was 6 months ago  during which she had well-controlled blood pressure and lipid profile. She reports not missing her medications but does sometimes forget to take her afternoon doses. She did not experience any kind of warning signs before the current episode.  Given this acute presentation with clear onset  a stroke was suspected and a head CT scan was ordered immediately upon arrival to assess for any intra-cranial hemorrhages before further management. The doctors already alerted the stroke team in anticipation of possible acute thrombolytic intervention.
Stroke,2,41,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Abdi Mohammed  a 68-year-old right-handed Somali man  presents to the emergency department via EMS because of sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began about 2 hours ago. He was watching television alone at home when his symptoms started.   His major comorbid conditions include hypertension for 20 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  and hypercholesterolemia for 10 years. He is a smoker with a 40-pack-year history  and consumes 2-3 glasses of home-made wine every day. Mr. Mohammed does not have a previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. He follows his treatments consistently but does not follow a regular diet and does not engage in much physical activity. He lives alone since his wife passed away a year ago.   There is no family history of stroke  but his father had a heart attack at the age of 60. Mr. Mohammed displays symptoms of neglect toward the right side of his body and the right visual field. His speech is slurred  and he appears anxious and afraid. His glucose level in the emergency department is 200 mg/dL  blood pressure is 185/95 mmHg  heart rate is normal at 75 beats per minute  and the electrocardiogram displays signs of old inferior wall myocardial infarction.   Upon initial visual assessment  Mr. Mohammed's right arm drifts downwards when extended  and he struggles to walk due to right leg weakness. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 14 (E4V4M6). His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 9  indicating a moderate stroke.   This case illustrates the demographic trend that indicates a higher prevalence of strokes among older adults  particularly those with existing comorbidity like hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol. Additionally  it reflects the literature showing stroke prevalence being higher among persons who use tobacco and consume alcohol  as well as among ethnic/minority groups.
Stroke,2,42,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Diaz is a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who was brought into the clinic by her son today for an evaluation. She has a past medical history significant for systemic hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been poorly controlled despite continuous oral medication. According to her son  Ms. Diaz has been complaining of a persistent headache for the past 3 hours. He also noticed his mother having difficulty in talking with sudden slurring of speech. Earlier today  Ms. Diaz sustained a fall at home due to sudden weakness on her right side and has been unable to use her right arm effectively since then. She also has developed a droop on the right side of her face. She denies any history of smoking or alcohol consumption. There is no family history of stroke or heart disease. Her vital signs are within normal limits  but her blood glucose level is elevated.  This scenario represents a geriatric Latinx individual  which correlates with literature showing that this population is more likely to experience a higher prevalence of stroke risk factors  such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Additionally  the clinical presentation described correlates with the typical symptoms of a stroke. The patient's elevated blood glucose level is a major risk factor that may lead to a stroke due to hyperglycemia-induced vascular damage. The patient lives with her son  which indicates a support system at home  a crucial factor for recovery post-stroke.
Stroke,2,43,Patient Information: James Anderson  a 68-year-old right-handed African American male  retired teacher.  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking.  Present Illness: Mr. Anderson's symptoms started about 2 hours ago while he was reading a newspaper. He suddenly noticed he was unable to lift his right arm and was having difficulty speaking. His wife noted a droop on the right side of his face. He denies headache  dizziness or loss of consciousness. No recent trauma or falls reported. He also reported mild shortness of breath.

He is alert and oriented to person  place  time  and situation.  In light of the patient's symptoms  history  and clinical findings  an acute ischemic stroke is highly suspected. Urgent assessment and intervention are paramount at this point. 
Stroke,2,47,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Ahmed is a 68-year-old African American male who came into the hospital with complaints of severe headache  confusion  and sudden loss of balance. The onset of these symptoms was rapid  within 60-90 minutes before his admission. His wife reported that he also had difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  slurred speech  and sudden weakness or numbness of the face and one side of the body.   Demographic Details:  Mr. Ahmed is a retired school teacher  currently being a full-time homemaker. He is a resident of Brooklyn  New York. He is married and has three grown-up children. He is a non-smoker but drinks moderately. He has a non-vegetarian diet  but he maintains a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables as advised by his dietician.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Ahmed has a history of essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed approximately ten years ago. He also has a positive family history of cerebrovascular disease  with his mother having suffered a stroke in her late-fifties.    In terms of medications  he takes Metformin 500mg twice daily for his diabetes  and Lisinopril 10mg once daily for his hypertension. His blood pressure is usually well-controlled with medication  but his wife reported that he has been less compliant with his medication in the last three weeks. His last HbA1c result about two months ago was 7.5%  suggesting adequate ongoing control of his diabetes.   The rapidness of the onset of his symptoms  added to his numerous associated risk factors (older age  being male  African American ethnicity  essential hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and a family history of cerebrovascular disease)  increases the likelihood of the current presentation being a stroke.
Stroke,2,48,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Wang  a 65-year-old Asian male  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  speech difficulties  and facial droop that started two hours ago. Mr. Wang was previously independent  living alone  and actively managing his small retail business. His daughter  who lives nearby  found him in this state during her routine visit.  Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. Wang has a known history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the last ten years. According to his daughter  he is quite non-compliant with his medications  particularly his antihypertensive medicines. He has also been a chronic smoker for about 40 years. He previously experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years ago  which was well-managed with medication and lifestyle changes. He's also being treated for hyperlipidemia for the past 4 years. His father died at age 70 due to a stroke  and a family history of cardiovascular disease is notable.  His current medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin  but compliance with these medications seems to be relatively inconsistent.  On examination  his Blood Pressure is 165/95 mmHg  and his blood sugar is 210 mg/dL. His body mass index (BMI) of 27.5 indicates overweight status.  Hence  Mr. Wang's presentation and history strongly suggest a potential stroke. Guidelines would suggest immediate medical intervention  including stroke workup protocol  given his ongoing symptoms. His previous history and risk factors including age  uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  established history of TIA  and chronic smoking habit make him highly susceptible to stroke.
Stroke,2,49,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Lee is a 72-year-old Asian male who has been brought to the emergency department by his wife  who reported that he suddenly developed left-sided weakness and slurred speech roughly three hours ago. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed over the past 20 years through oral medications. His adherence to his medications is acceptable  as per family report.  He has no known history of heart disease  but his father suffered from a stroke at the age of 80. He is a non-smoker and only consumes alcohol occasionally in social settings. He has an unremarkable surgical history and has allergies to penicillin causing him to develop a rash. His home medications include Lisinopril and Metformin daily.  On examination  his physical vitals are stable. Neurological examination revealed a facial droop on the left side  muscle strength of his left upper and lower extremities is 2/5  and his reflexes are brisk on the left side. His speech is slurred and his pupil reaction is normal bilaterally. His gait could not be evaluated due to evident weakness.  Overall  his presentation appears consistent with a possible right hemispheric ischemic stroke. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes  along with his age and ethnicity  increases his risk for a stroke event. Further assessments including imaging study and blood tests are warranted to confirm the diagnosis  understand the severity  and guide the appropriate treatment plan.
Stroke,2,50,Patient Presentation  A 64-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of weakness on the right side of his body and difficulty speaking. His wife  who accompanied him  reported that he had been fine when he woke up  but about an hour later she noticed him having trouble with simple tasks like buttoning his shirt and drinking coffee. She also noticed that he was slurring his words and seemed confused.  The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been poorly controlled over the past few years. Additionally  he is a former heavy smoker with a 30 pack-year history (quit 10 years ago).  His vitals on presentation were stable but his BP was elevated at 170/90 mmHg. An urgent head CT was performed which showed early signs of an ischemic stroke.  Family history revealed that his mother had suffered a stroke at the age of 70. The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and admits non-compliance with diet restrictions and antihypertensive medication. He currently lives with his wife and they have two grown-up children.
Stroke,2,51,"Patient Presentation:  Mrs. M is a 63-year-old African American female with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  presenting to the emergency department with acute onset right sided weakness and slurred speech. The symptoms started approximately 2 hours prior to arrival while she was cooking breakfast at home. She suddenly dropped a dish due to loss of strength in her right hand  noticed her speech was slurred when she called for her husband and observed her right side felt """"heavy."""" She denies any headaches  dizziness  confusion  vision changes or seizures prior to the onset. Her husband confirms there was no loss of consciousness or seizures witnessed.   Mrs. M's past medical history includes hypertension controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine  and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin. She has no known allergies. She used to smoke 1 pack per day for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. She does not consume alcohol or use drugs. Family history includes a stroke in her father at the age of 82.    On examination  her blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg  pulse 70 beats/min and regular  respiratory rate 18/min  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Neurological examination reveals a global aphasia  right-sided hemiparesis  and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) of 10.   Given the time of symptom onset and her clinical presentation  a stroke code is activated. An urgent CT brain is ordered to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and commencement of thrombolysis is considered given the timeline. Management of her blood pressure and blood glucose levels are initiated."
Stroke,2,52,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Brenda Williams  a 72-year-old African American woman  presented to the emergency department. Ms. Williams was noted having difficulty speaking and moving the right side of her body at her senior living home earlier in the day. Her coworkers reported that she was speaking in a slurred manner and became unable to hold her coffee cup without spilling  both of which were abnormal behaviors for her.  Past Medical History: Ms. Williams has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and high cholesterol. Unfortunately  her adherence to medication has been inconsistent due to her struggles with health literacy and limited financial resources. She has a 40-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago.  Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S. and is more common in the elderly; with the risk of having a stroke more than doubles each decade after the age of 55. Hypertension  diabetes  and smoking are known risk factors. African Americans have nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with Whites. Uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes are also more prevalent amongst African Americans  leading to higher stroke incidences. Women are also more likely than men to have a stroke each year. Therefore  our patient falls into multiple high-risk categories.
Stroke,2,53,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset  right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. He was brought in by his daughter who reported that he had been speaking to her on the phone when he suddenly started slurring his words.   Mr. Rodriguez has a past medical history significant for type II diabetes  for which he takes Metformin  and hypertension  which is under control with Lisinopril. His family history includes his father  who died of a stroke at the age of 75. He has no surgical history.   He quit smoking 10 years ago but has a 20 pack-year history. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He is married  has three children  and is a retired construction worker. He is currently living with his wife and is mostly independent in activities of daily living.   Upon initial examination  he has a Blood Pressure of 170/100 mmHg  heart rate of 80 beats per minute  and an O2 saturation of 98% on room air. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 14/15. His right upper and lower limbs show a power of 3/5 and has mild facial droop with slurred speech suggesting dysarthria.   Given the clinical manifestation and past medical history  a clinical diagnosis of stroke was concluded. An urgent CT scan was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and differential between an ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.  This presentation is representative as literature reports that the stroke incidence increases with age and is higher among males. Additionally  stroke rates are higher among Hispanic populations  partly due to the high incidence of diabetes and hypertension.
Stroke,2,54,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided facial droopiness  slurred speech  and right arm weakness which he noticed when he woke up this morning at approximately 7:00 AM. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and he is a current smoker. Mr. Smith states his last usual state of health was last night before he went to sleep around 10:00 PM.   His blood pressure upon arrival is 175/90 mmHg  heart rate is 95 bpm  temperature is 37.2°C  respiratory rate is 19 bpm  and his O2 saturation is 97% on room air. Mr. Smith lives with his wife who is primarily responsible for his care. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  poorly controlled - Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Metformin and diet modifications - History of smoking for the past 50 years  averaging one pack a day - No known drug allergies.  His father died of a heart attack at age 74 and his mother had a stroke at age 70. He has a sister who has hypertension and a brother who has type 2 diabetes. His daily medications include lisinopril  metformin  and atorvastatin.
Stroke,2,55,Patient Profile:   Mr. Diego Gonzalez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department today with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulties. He developed symptoms approx. an hour ago while having breakfast with his wife.  Past Medical History:   He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with these conditions 10 years ago and has been taking medications irregularly.   Family history:   His father had a history of ischemic stroke in his late sixties. His mother suffered from diabetes and hypertension.  Substance Use:   Mr. Gonzalez has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and admits having a couple of beers every weekend.   Presentation:  He is alert  but speech is slurred and he is unable to move his right arm and leg. His wife also reported that he seemed confused and had trouble understanding her shortly after the symptom onset. His vital signs on admission were a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and temperature of 36.8C. He scores 12 out of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale.  Emergency Stroke Measures:  Time is a crucial factor in this situation  and the stroke team has been activated for a potential thrombolytic treatment after the necessary diagnostic steps. 
Stroke,2,56,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Hernandez  a 66-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden weakness on the right side of his body  specifically noticeable in his arm and leg  occurring approximately 90 minutes prior to his arrival. He also reports difficulty speaking and slurred speech that started simultaneously with the weakness. He denies experiencing headache  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.   He has a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are being managed with antihypertensive  oral hypoglycemic agents  and statin respectively. He admits occasional forgetfulness about taking his medications. He is a former smoker  has quit smoking about five years ago. The family history is significant for his father who had a stroke in his early 70s.  On examination  he is alert  his speech is slurred  and there's a pronounced weakness and decreased sensation in his right upper and lower extremities. His vital signs are as follows: Blood Pressure: 168/92 mm Hg; Heart Rate: 92 beats/min; Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min; Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air; Temperature: 37.2 C.  His CT scan conducted in the emergency department suggests a likely ischemic stroke. Mr. Hernandez is immediately stabilized and evaluated for potential thrombolytic therapy. His case underlines the importance of patients with high-risk profiles getting regular medical follow-ups and adherence to medication regimen to minimize the risk of such severe consequences.
Stroke,2,57,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Brown  a 68-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and facial droop that started about two hours before arrival. The patient was at his home when his symptoms started abruptly.  His wife  who took him to the hospital  reported that he looked confused and was not able to hold a cup of coffee in his right hand  which he dropped. Additionally  she noticed drooping on the right side of his face and his speech was slurred. There was no reported history of trauma  fever  or recent infection.  He has a significant past medical history including hypertension which was diagnosed 15 years ago  type 2 diabetes for 10 years  and hyperlipidemia overtime. The patient is compliant with his medications: Losartan  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. He is an ex-smoker and quit 5 years ago but had a long history of smoking of approximately 50 pack-years.  Family history is significant for stroke in his father who died in his 70s  and a brother who had a myocardial infarction. The patient denies any illicit drug use or excess alcohol consumption.  On physical examination  the blood pressure was 180/100mmHg and other vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria  right facial droop  and motor power 3/5 in the right upper and lower limbs. Sensation and coordination were intact on the left side  and no sensory deficit was apparent on the right. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk on the right side.  The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Emergency CT of the head was ordered for further evaluation and acute stroke management was initiated based on the initial assessment.
Stroke,2,58,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Martha Wilson  a 68-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department accompanied by her daughter. She reports sudden onset of weakness on her right side  difficulty speaking  and loss of balance which began approximately 2 hours ago at home. She complains of a headache but no acute chest pain. She describes the headache as non-throbbing but constant.  Past medical history includes hypertension for 15 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  hyperlipidemia  and a transient ischemic attack 5 years ago. She has regular doctor's appointments and is compliant with her daily medications which include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Simvastatin. She has no known allergies.  She quit smoking 10 years ago  doesn't consume alcohol  and denies illicit drug use. Her father had a stroke at the age of 72 and her mother died of heart disease in her late 60s.   On physical examination  she has facial droop on the right side  speech difficulty  loss of strength in her right upper and lower limbs  and loss of sensation on the right side of her body. Her blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg  pulse 88 bpm  and glucose level is 198 mg/dl.   Ms. Wilson's age  race  and medical history  particularly hypertension  diabetes  and previous transient ischemic attack  increase her risk for ischemic stroke as is demonstrated in epidemiological studies.
Stroke,2,59,Patient Presentation:  Ms. L  an African American woman aged 65  presents to our emergency department unusually feeling weak on the right side of her body. She was reportedly speaking in a confused manner and had difficulty with her balance according to her daughter who accompanied her. Ms. L lives independently in an urban community dwelling setting  is widowed and is retired from her job as an elementary school teacher.  Ms. L has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She also comes from a family with a significant history of stroke on her maternal side. She had one previous episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago which resolved fully within 24 hours. She is currently on antihypertensive medication and metformin for her diabetes.  She thus presents with symptoms indicative of an acute stroke and considering her age  race  and medical history  she's at a high risk for a cerebrovascular accident. She requires immediate stroke workup and management to prevent further complications and potential disability.
Stroke,2,60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African American male with a known history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been brought to the emergency department by his wife due to a sudden onset of weakness on the right side of his body particularly affecting his right arm and leg  since morning. In addition to the weakness  his wife also reports that he faced difficulty speaking and his mouth seemed to droop on one side.  His wife informed that he had missed his antihypertensive medication for the past 2 days. His blood pressure on arrival is 180/110 mmHg  pulse 85 beats/min  respiratory rate 18/min and blood glucose is 200 mg/dl. He has no history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or recreational drug use.

He is retired and lives with his wife and has a stressful life over caring for his sick wife. His BMI indicates mild obesity and he has been advised weight loss and dietary modifications in the past.  On neurologic examination  he shows signs of expressive aphasia and facial droop on the right side along with decreased strength in the right upper and lower extremities. The clinical suspicion is that of an ischemic stroke and requires urgent attention and management. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 8.
Stroke,2,61,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Juan Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  is currently presented with sudden numbness and weakness on his left side  predominantly affecting his arm and face. He has also reported difficulty with clarity in speech since the past one hour. The symptoms were sudden in onset while he was watching TV at home after his regular evening walk.   His past medical history is significant  including type 2 diabetes for the past ten years  hypertension for the past seven years and a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) one year ago. His diabetes and hypertension are normally well controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. He has no known allergies.  Socially  he is a retired mechanic  is married  and lives with his wife. His family history reveals that both his parents had strokes in their late 60s. He was a former smoker  having quit about 25 years ago  but consumes alcohol socially.  On examination  he is found to be conscious  but his speech is dysarthric. His blood pressure is 165/94  heart rate is 92 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 18 per minute  and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His temperature is currently 98.6°F. His blood glucose level recorded in the ambulance reads 189 mg/dL.  This presentation and clinical history is suggestive of stroke and Mr. Rodriguez immediately admitted for further evaluation and management.
Stroke,2,62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 72-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. He significantly lacks facial expression on right side. His symptoms began about 2 hours prior to presenting to the ER  when he was found by his wife on the bathroom floor.   Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a former smoker and quit approximately 20 years ago. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He is currently on medication including lisinopril  metformin and atorvastatin.   His vital signs on presentation are as follows: BP 180/95 mmHg  HR 90/min  RR 16/min  Temp 98.6 F and SpO2 96% on room air.   Mr. Doe's wife states that he has been non-compliant with his medications and has missed follow-ups with his primary care doctor over the past few months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also has a positive family history of stroke; his mother had a stroke at the age of 80.   Mr. Doe is retired and lives with his wife. He is a veteran and previously worked as an engineer in a government firm. His wife noticed he was slurring his speech when he tried to call out for help. She also noticed that he had difficulty moving his right arm and right leg.  This clinical scenario has a strong correlation with stroke and urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate whether patient would benefit from thrombolysis or thrombectomy.
Stroke,2,63,Patient Presentation  A Caucasian female patient  aged 73  presented to the Emergency Room at around 8:54 AM reporting difficulty speaking and understanding spoken language  with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and numbness. She also acknowledged a sudden severe headache at the onset of her symptoms  accompanied by vomiting. Her family  who accompanied her  also reported that she had a slightly altered mental status- being intermittently confused  something they have not observed previously. Her full initial presentation was identified as difficulty speaking  right-sided weakness  severe headache  and altered mental status  suggesting a potential stroke.  Past medical history revealed she has been managing hypertension and atrial fibrillation for the past 10 years and has been on a recommended regimen of aspirin and warfarin. She is a retired teacher  lived independently  and has not smoked nor consumed excessive alcohol. She had no recorded allergies. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 68.  Given the scenario  it's found to be consistent with the prior history  age  and race where stroke incidence is common. Current demographics mirror the acquired scenario given  i.e.  strokes are more prevalent in the Caucasian race  often women  who are 65+ and have predisposing cardiovascular conditions. Atrial fibrillation and hypertension are significant risk factors as well for ischemic stroke.
Stroke,2,64,Patient Profile: Mr. Joe Alvarez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  presenting with acute onset right sided weakness and aphasia.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Alvarez reports that about 3 hours ago  he suddenly experienced helpless weakness on his right side that prevented him from rising from his chair. Associated symptoms include speech difficulty and a sudden  severe headache.   Past Medical History: Patient history reveals that Mr. Alvarez has been diagnosed with hypertension and high LDL cholesterol levels 5 years ago  and has been on medication since then. Mr. Alvarez is a non-insulin dependent diabetic and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago. Apparently  Mr. Alvarez is a moderate smoker - a habit he picked up back when he was in his twenties  and he has been trying to quit for the past few years. He is known to have a family history of stroke; his older brother suffered from a stroke at the age of 70.   Social History: Mr. Alvarez is married  lives with his wife  and has two daughters who live out of state. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has been trying to follow a diet plan for his health issues.   Hispanic men are disproportionately affected by stroke  and Mr. Alvarez's chronic condition of hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  and his smoking habit  which are all risk factors for stroke  predispose him to this situation. The condition further suggests that the patient might be experiencing an ischemic stroke  which is indeed a major health concern in the elderly population.
Stroke,2,65,Patient Presentation  Patient is a 66-year-old African American male named Mr. Smith  a retired construction worker  who was brought to the emergency department with acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech.  At 10:30 am  while he was in his living room reading the newspaper  he suddenly felt a severe headache with a pain he described as 'the worst of his life.' His wife reported noticing slurred speech  right-sided facial droop  and Mr. Smith had difficulty moving his right arm and leg. The symptoms led her to call 911 immediately.  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years prior. Patient has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit five years ago  has a moderate alcohol use history  and has no drug history. He is compliant with his medications  which include Losartan  Metformin  and Simvastatin.  Mr. Smith's father had a stroke in his 60s which makes a family history of possible relevance. The patient is married and lives with his wife who is his primary caregiver.   On arrival  he had a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg  a pulse rate of 92 beats per minute  a temperature of 98.7°F  a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. Neurological examination was consistent with a NIH stroke scale of 12  indicating a potentially severe stroke.  Due to the timing and presentation of the symptoms  the patient was immediately sent for a brain CT scan for further evaluation.
Stroke,2,66,Patient Information: Mr. Alvaro Moreno  65-year-old Hispanic male  Chief Complaint: Acute onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech for the past 2 hours  History of Present Illness: Mr. Moreno states he was watching television when he suddenly felt weak on his left side and his speech became slurred. He attempted to get up from his chair and found that his left leg was weak as well. He denied any trauma or recent illness. He notes no associated symptoms such as headache  chest pain or difficulty breathing.  Past Medical History: Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  well-controlled with Lisinopril; Hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin; No known drug allergies; Smoked 1 pack per day for 30 years  but quit 5 years ago.   Social History: Retired cab driver  lives with his wife; drinks alcohol socially; no illicit drug use.  Family History: Mother had a stroke at age 70; Father died of heart disease at age 65; one brother has diabetes.   Exam: Blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg; pulse 80 bpm and regular; respirations 18/min; temperature 37.0°C. Speech is slurred with normal language comprehension. Strength is 2/5 in the left upper and lower limbs. Right side strength is 5/5. Coordination is intact on the right but impaired on the left. There is left facial droop.   Emergency Head CT: No evidence of haemorrhage; a CT angiogram shows occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery.   Impression: The acute onset of left-sided weakness  left facial droop  and speech difficulties in this patient with vascular risk factors is suggestive of an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory. He is within the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy  pending further evaluation.
Stroke,2,67,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Smith is a 69-year-old African American male presenting with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and problems with balance that started approximately 2 hours ago according to his wife.   Background Information:  Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are both currently managed with medications. He is a non-smoker but drinks occasionally. His father died at the age of 72 due to stroke  and his mother had a history of heart disease. There is no family history of coagulation disorders. He has been non-compliant with his hypertension and diabetic medications and hasn't seen a doctor for the past 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Examination:  On examination  he appears in moderate distress due to his symptoms. His speech is slurred  and he seems to have difficulty forming words. The left side of his face appears to droop with asymmetrical smiling  and patient is unable to raise his left arm to the same height as his right arm.   Vitals:  His vitals on arrival are Blood Pressure: 170/95 mm Hg  Pulse: 82 beats per minute  Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute  Temperature: 37.1 °C  Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air.   Summary and Plan:  The current symptoms and presentation suggest a possible ischemic stroke  potentially due to the patient's uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. A STAT neurology consultation is sought  and patient is planned immediately for a CT scan of the brain to confirm the diagnosis and rule out hemorrhagic stroke.
Stroke,2,68,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Peterson is a 68-year-old African American male who presents with sudden onset of speech slurring  right-sided facial droop and right-sided weakness occurring an hour ago while having breakfast. He was brought in by his wife who noticed the symptoms and immediately called for an ambulance.  Mr. Peterson has a past medical history of hypertension for 20 years  diabetes mellitus for 15 years  and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. His medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. His mother and older brother had strokes in their early 70s.   His BP is 180/90 mmHg  HR 92 BPM  RR 18 BPM and oxygen saturation as 97% on room air. On neurological examination  he was found to have expressive aphasia  right-sided facial droop and 3/5 motor strength in right upper and lower limbs indicating a likely left hemisphere stroke.   His blood glucose level at admission was 180 mg/dl. Other initial laboratory tests including complete blood count  electrolyte panel  liver function  renal function  and coagulation profile are pending.  Given his vivid symptomatology  continued risk factors  and history suggestive of cerebrovascular disease in the family  there is a high index of suspicion for an ischemic stroke. The patient is considered for thrombolytic therapy and has been sent to the radiology department on an urgent basis for a CT brain without contrast to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. His wife  who is his health care proxy  is available and informed about his condition. 
Stroke,2,69,Patient Information: Ms. Johnson  65-year-old African-American female  Presenting Concerns: Ms. Johnson presents to the Emergency Department with abrupt onset of speech difficulty  right arm weakness  and unsteady gait noticed by her daughter this morning. She also complains of a sudden  severe headache. No history of trauma or loss of consciousness.  Medical history: She has been diagnosed with hypertension  DM Type 2  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are currently managed with oral medications. She quit smoking 10 years ago  but has a 30 year pack history before cessation.   Family history: Two of her siblings have encountered stroke incidents  one of whom deceased as a result.  Review of Systems: She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. Vision and hearing are unchanged.   Physical examination reveals moderate-to-severe right-sided weakness including facial droop and arm drift. Her speech is slurred but she seems to understand questions appropriately.  Clinical Concern: Given the acute onset of neurological deficits  there is a high suspicion for a stroke  more specifically  an ischemic stroke due to her risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia) and family history. There is an urgency to perform a CT scan and a possible need for thrombolytic therapy considering the time of onset. 
Stroke,2,70,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 71-year-old African American female  identified as Mrs. Smith. She is brought to the hospital by her son. Mrs. Smith is a retired school teacher  widowed  living with her son and his family. The main concern is the abrupt onset of right-sided weakness and accompanying speech difficulties that began approximately three hours prior to arrival.   According to her son  his mother  who has a known diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes  seemed fine at breakfast. But a few hours later  she began slurring her words and was found to have difficulty moving her right arm and leg. There are no complaints of headache  loss of consciousness  or seizures.   Mrs. Smith is a known hypertensive for ten years  manages her condition with amlodipine  and has had diabetes mellitus for seven years  which she controls with metformin. She reports she had a transient ischemic attack five years ago but suffered no complications. Mrs. Smith denies a history of smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use but mentions that her diet could be better. Her family history is significant for cerebrovascular disease  with her father suffering a stroke in his early 60s.   No history of trauma  falls  or recent illnesses were noted.   This case was treated on an emergency basis  considering her symptoms and epidemiologic context  i.e.  age  race  sex  and comorbidities  which increase her susceptibility to stroke.
Stroke,2,71,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Linda Cruz  a 70-year-old Latina female  presents to the emergency room with a sudden slumped posture and an inability to maintain steady gait. The patient's daughter  who accompanied her  affirms that Mrs. Cruz also displayed acute confusion and difficulty speaking about four hours prior to arriving at the hospital. Mrs. Cruz has no known history of alcohol or tobacco use.   On examination  the right side of her face droops considerably  and she's unable to raise her right arm. The patient's speech is slurred and she exhibits difficulty finding words. Mrs. Cruz's medical records indicate she has a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes lisinopril  metformin  and atorvastatin respectively. Despite the medical treatment  her blood glucose and blood pressure have often found to be poorly controlled on routine checks. She was noncompliant with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise  as recommended by her primary care physician.  Mrs. Cruz had also reported sporadic episodes of intense headaches and dizziness over the past six months  for which she self-medicated with over-the-counter pain relievers and dismissed it as stress. No imaging or referrals were made at that time. She has no history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. She has a family history significant for stroke  with her mother having suffered from a stroke at the age of 68.  Given Mrs. Cruz's sudden onset of neurological deficits  previous medical history  and her poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes  she is suspected of having an ischemic cerebrovascular accident  or stroke.
Stroke,2,72,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Smith is a 70-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type two diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency department accompanied by his wife who had noticed sudden onset of his neurological deficits. According to her  he was well until this morning when he suddenly developed weakness of the right side of his body  difficulty in speaking  and drooping of the right side of the face.   The symptoms were all new  abrupt in onset  and lasted over one hour. They denied any headache  altered consciousness  seizure  vision changes  or bowel or bladder incontinence. Mrs. Smith mentioned that  for the past six months  her husband had been non-compliant with his antihypertensive and diabetic medications because he felt well and thought he didn't require them.   His last dose of medication was last night  and he was noted to be normotensive and euglycemic a month ago at his primary care doctor's consultation. He went on to acknowledge his addiction to smoking  with a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years and occasional alcohol consumption. There was no significant family history of stroke; however  his dad was diagnosed with type two diabetes mellitus and hypertension at the age of 75. Mr. Smith being a retired accountant  lives with his wife in their apartment and has two supportive sons who stay nearby.   He is not known to have any known drug allergies. There is no history of recent surgery or traumatic injury. Upon initial evaluation  Mr. Smith is alert  follows commands yet shows signs of moderate distress due to his inability to move his right hand and leg.   Thus  with his age  race  uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes mellitus  and smoking history  Mr. Smith resides in a demographic that is at a high risk for ischemic stroke as per the literature.
Stroke,2,73,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Patricia is a 72-year-old African American female who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. The symptoms started about 2 hours ago when she was watching television at home.  Mrs. Patricia has a past medical history notable for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and atrial fibrillation. She has been on medications for these conditions –metoprolol  lisinopril and metformin. However  she admits she has been non-compliant with her anticoagulation (warfarin) for atrial fibrillation. She denies smoking but admits to moderate alcohol consumption. She does not have any known drug allergies.  Her family history is notable for stroke; her mother suffered a stroke at the age of 80 years.   She is a retired teacher  lives with her husband who is her primary caregiver. She has three children  all of them live out of state but visit frequently. Her husband noticed her condition and immediately called the ambulance.  On examination  she has facial droop on the right side  marked right-sided body weakness and impaired sensation. She is alert but shows signs of aphasia. Her blood pressure on presentation is 170/95 mmHg  heart rate 88 bpm  irregular  and she has a blood glucose level of 210 mg/dL. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission is calculated to be 12.   The clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute left hemispheric cerebrovascular accident. She was immediately sent for a CT scan to rule out haemorrhagic stroke and to further evaluate the condition.
Stroke,2,74,Patient Presentation  A 68-year-old African American male patient presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of weakness on the right side of the body  facial drooping on the right side  and difficulty speaking  which began approximately 2 hours prior to his arrival. He reports no known injury or trauma that may have provoked his symptoms.   His wife accompanied him  and further informs the medical team that her husband seemed confused and struggled to communicate coherently during the car ride to the hospital. She denies witnessing any tonic-clonic activity or altered consciousness in her husband.  Past Medical History  The patient has a known history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin. He is a former pack-a-day smoker with a 30-year history but quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol moderately  consisting majorly of red wine during meals. His father died of an ischemic stroke at age 74 and his elder brother experienced a hemorrhagic stroke at age 55.  Conclusion  Given the sudden onset of one-sided weakness  facial droop  slurred speech and confusion  the patient’s presentation is highly suggestive of an acute stroke. His past medical history which includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as family history raises his risk factor for the same. Immediate neurologic assessment and imaging are warranted to further evaluate the patient.
Stroke,2,75,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Linda Carter  a 68-year-old African American female  presented to the Emergency Department accompanied by her daughter. She complained of sudden onset of weakness on the right side of her body and difficulty in talking that started two hours prior to admission. Symptom onset was while she was having lunch at home. Her daughter noticed her slurred speech and immediate inability to grab her cup with her right hand.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Carter has Hypertension for the past 20 years  well-controlled on medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily). She also has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for about 15 years  managed on Metformin 500 mg twice daily and yearly eye check-ups. She is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago  having previously smoked half a pack per day for 30 years. There is also a known history of Ischemic Heart Disease diagnosed four years ago for which she is on Aspirin 75 mg and Atorvastatin 20 mg  daily. She denies any history of previous stroke/TIA  atrial fibrillation or any other relevant illnesses. She has no family history of stroke. She has no known allergies.  On examination  her BP was 166/90 mm of Hg  pulse 82 beats per minute  rhythmic and her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation remaining 96% on room air. On neurological examination  the patient showed expressive aphasia (unable to talk fluently)  right-sided facial droop  and right-sided hemiparesis (Power 2/5).  Considering the sudden onset of symptoms  her risk factors including Hypertension  Diabetes  Smoking  Ischemic Heart Disease  and presence of classic neurological deficits  a provisional diagnosis of an acute left-hemispheric ischemic stroke was made. An urgent CT scan of the head was ordered to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and start thrombolytic therapy as needed.
Stroke,2,76,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Sanchez is a 67-year-old Hispanic male presenting to the Emergency Department with complaints of sudden onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech that started approximately 1 hour prior to arrival. He denies recent illness or injury. His symptoms are accompanied by a mild headache  but no loss of consciousness  confusion  balance issues  or visual disturbances.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  managed with lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  managed with atorvastatin. He admits to occasional cigarette smoking but denies significant alcohol or illicit drug use. There is a family history of stroke in his older brother and father.   On physical examination  the patient was observed to have left facial droop  left arm weakness and slightly slurred speech. His vital signs are as follows: BP 162/98 mm Hg  HR 74 bpm  RR 16 breaths/min  Temp 98.6°F (37°C)  and O2 Sat 97% on room air.  Given his sudden onset of symptoms and his risk factors including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  cigarette smoking and positive family history  there is a high suspicion of ischemic stroke. The patient was immediately seen by the stroke team and a non-contrast CT scan of his head was taken which confirmed the diagnosis.   Mr. Sanchez was transferred to the stroke unit for further management  which included treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. His lisinopril was continued for blood pressure management  and atorvastatin was continued for controlling his cholesterol level. His smoking status will also need to be addressed as part of his long-term preventative care.
Stroke,2,77,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Harold Black is a 72-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of symptoms which include right-sided weakness  difficulty in speaking  and balance problems. He is accompanied by his daughter who states that these symptoms started suddenly after breakfast earlier today. She also notes that her father did not have any similar issues in the past.   Past Medical History:  The daughter informs that Mr. Black has been dealing with hypertension for the past 20 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years. His other medical history includes hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. He had a coronary artery bypass surgery in 2009. He takes Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension  Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes  and Atorvastatin 10 mg daily for hyperlipidemia. His last checkup was six months ago when his doctor advised that he needed to manage his diabetes and hypertension more effectively. He does not smoke or drink alcohol.   Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease.

He has a social alcohol intake of about 1-2 units of alcohol per week and denies illicit drug use.  Family History  Hiroshi’s father had a stroke at the age of 74  and his mother has well-controlled type 2 diabetes. His younger brother has hypertension.  Review of Systems  Patient reports chronic dull headache as part of his hypertension but no headache today. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or abdominal pain.  Physical Examination  Hiroshi is alert and oriented to time  place  and person but has dysarthria and right-sided weakness noticed on the motor exam. Facial asymmetry is noted with drooping on the right side. His gait is unsteady  and he appears feeble. The remainder of his examination is unremarkable.  Investigations   Immediate computed tomography (CT scan) of the brain is planned to evaluate for a stroke. Subsequent imaging with MRI and vascular studies recommended. Electrocardiogram and lab investigations for electrolyte imbalance  creatinine level  and blood glucose level will also be performed  given his past medical history and current presentation.
Stroke,2,79,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Laura Kim  a 73-year-old Asian female  presents to the emergency department. She reports sudden onset weakness on the right side of her body  problems with speech  blurred vision in one eye  and feeling a sudden  intense headache earlier today. She rates her headache as 8/10 on the pain scale. She first noticed these symptoms around three hours ago.  History:  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which is mostly controlled on lisinopril 20mg daily  and hyperlipidemia  managed with statins. She has a 40-pack a year smoking history  but quit 5 years ago. She has no known drug allergies. She lives alone  is independent with activities of daily living  and has 2 adult children who live nearby. She denies any recent traumas  falls  or recent illnesses.  Family History:  Her mother had a stroke at the age of 81  and her maternal family has a history of heart disease.  Social History:  She is retired  a non-drinker  and occasionally attends social gatherings with her friends from her previous work. She loves gardening and reading books in her spare time.   Review of Systems:  Negative except as noted in the history of present illness.  Examination:  On physical examination  you note that she has mild facial droop on the right  aphasia  and a right hemiparesis (with a power of 3/5 in the right upper and lower limbs). Her blood pressure is elevated at 170/90 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination reveals no abnormalities and lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. Neurological examination is suggestive of a left hemisphere stroke.  This presentation indicates a probable ischemic stroke  and immediate evaluation and treatment are necessary. Evaluations include a complete blood count  coagulation studies  electrolyte levels  liver and kidney function  EKG  and most importantly  a non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. After an immediate neurology consult  the patient may be a candidate for thrombolytic therapy if there are no contraindications.
Stroke,2,80,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 59-year-old African American male who presents today with sudden onset of difficulty talking  right-sided facial drooping  and right-sided weakness that started less than an hour ago. He notes he was fine when he woke up this morning  but while having breakfast  he noticed he was slurring his words  had difficulty lifting his right arm  and felt the right side of his face drooping. He also experienced a mild headache. Mr. Johnson has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are relatively well-controlled with medications. He also has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years  although he quit last year. His family history is significant for stroke in his father at a similar age. Mr. Johnson lives with his wife and is retired from his previous job as a truck driver. He is of mid socioeconomic status with health insurance coverage. His neurological deficits  in conjunction with risk factors like age  race  hypertension  diabetes  and smoking history  raise the immediate concern of a possible stroke.
Stroke,2,81,Patient Presentation:  A 73-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with symptoms consistent with acute stroke. She was brought in by her eldest son who noticed her slurred speech and facial droop during their usual breakfast chat on the phone. The estimated time from symptom onset is within 3 hours.  Upon initial assessment  her vital signs were observed to be: blood pressure 158/92 mmHg  heart rate 88 bpm  respiratory rate 18 br/min  temperature 97.6 F  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.   On physical examination  she was oriented to place and person but not to time  with noted speech difficulties. Her right arm and leg showed significant weakness  with a score of 1 on the Motor Arm and Leg sections of the NIH Stroke Scale. Facial droop on the right side was also present.  The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. She has a 10-year history of smoking but quit three years ago. Her medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. She lives alone but speaks with her adult children daily  who live nearby.  Immediate CT scan of the brain was ordered to exclude an intracranial hemorrhage. Given the time of symptom onset and physical findings  the potential consideration for thrombolytic therapy is present pending imaging results.
Stroke,2,82,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Williams  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of left sided weakness and difficulty speaking which started two hours ago. He reports that he was having breakfast with his family when he suddenly found himself unable to lift his left hand that was holding his fork and subsequently slurred while speaking. There was no associated headache or loss of consciousness.  James has a known past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. Both conditions are under medical management  he is adherent to his medications Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes. However  his blood pressure and blood sugar levels have occasionally been elevated as per his last few outpatient follow-ups. James stopped smoking 6 years back and occasionally drinks alcohol socially. He is retired and lives with his wife of 40 years. They have 3 grown-up children and 6 grandchildren.  James' mother died of stroke at age 75  his father died of a heart attack at age 78. James had a paternal uncle who had a stroke at the age of 65. There are no known hereditary or congenital disorders in the family.  Thus  James represents a high-risk demographic for stroke  as literature supports that older age  male gender  African-American race  and a history of hypertension  diabetes  and family history of stroke are all risk factors associated with increased stroke incidence.
Stroke,2,83,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Albert Morgan  a 70-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of sudden onset left-sided weakness and trouble speaking  which began approximately 2 hours prior to his arrival. He was at home when he suddenly had difficulties lifting his left arm and his speech became slurred. His wife called an ambulatory service and brought him to the ED once they both recognized these symptoms as a possible stroke.  Mr. Morgan has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed with medication for the past 15 years. His blood pressure has been primarily controlled  but his glucose levels have occasionally been erratic. He is a former smoker  having quit about 10 years ago  but has a smoking history of 30 pack-years. He reports moderate alcohol consumption.  This is the first known occurrence of a potential stroke. He has no known allergies to medications. Current medications include Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. A review of systems is negative for recent illnesses  headaches  or physical injuries.  On physical examination  Mr. Morgan exhibits difficulty in speaking (dysarthria)  left-sided facial droop  and obvious left-sided bodily weakness  including in the arm and leg. His vital signs are stable but do show elevated blood pressure.   Given the acute onset of Mr. Morgan's symptoms  his current status  and relevant past medical history  he is at a high risk for an ischemic stroke. A CT scan is needed immediately to confirm the diagnosis and guide the intervention  with possible consideration to administer a thrombolytic agent. His case demonstrates the substantial stroke risk in patients with both uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  particularly in the African American population.
Stroke,2,84,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 70-year-old Hispanic male  comes to the emergency department (ED) with his wife  who reports that her husband was found slumped over the kitchen table this morning. She expresses that his speech is slurred  and he seems to have trouble moving his right arm and leg. According to Mrs. Rodriguez  he was in his usual state of health until this sudden onset of symptoms.  Mr. Rodriguez has a history of hypertension and has been on Lisinopril 10mg daily for the past 5 years. Further  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago  for which he takes Metformin 500mg twice daily. Despite these conditions  Mr. Rodriguez has not had any previous neurologic episodes or strokes  and he has no family history of stroke or any other significant neurological conditions. He is a lifetime non-smoker and denies any alcohol use.  Mr. Rodriguez retired from his job as a school bus driver 5 years ago  but has since engaged in active volunteer work at a local community center till yesterday when he experienced these sudden changes in his health status.  This sudden onset of right-sided weakness  along with slurred speech  are indicative of potential stroke  possibly ischemic in nature given his risk factors of age  hypertension  and diabetes. Further diagnostic investigations and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment are warranted.
Stroke,2,85,"Subjective:  Mr. Alejandro Diaz  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the Emergency Department with chief complaints of slurred speech and left-sided weakness. Onset was approximately 2 hours ago according to his wife who is present with him. Neither the patient nor the wife have clear understanding of what caused the symptoms  only mentioning that he """"suddenly fell when trying to get up from his chair”. His wife describes his lips to have been drooping on one side. No known trauma or injury.   Objective:  Upon physical examination by the attending physician  Mr. Diaz exhibits facial droop  mild aphasia  and left-sided hemiparesis. BP is 162/98  HR is 82  Temp. is 98.6°F  Blood glucose is 134 mg/dL. His weight is recorded at 215 lbs and height is 5'11''. His NIH Stroke Scale is determined to be 10.   Assessment:   His symptoms are suggestive of right MCA territory cerebrovascular accident (CVA)  most likely ischemic in nature due to the sudden onset of symptoms. Immediate attention is required.  Medical history included:  Mr. Diaz has a documented history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack year history but quit 10 years ago. No prior stroke or TIAs. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin. No known drug allergies. Family history is significant for a brother who had a myocardial infarction aged 65.  Lifestyle:  Mr. Diaz performs mild exercise daily  mostly walking the neighborhood. His diet could use improvements  as it is primarily composed of fast foods and processed dishes.  In terms of his social history  he is married with 3 grown children. He is recently retired and had spent most of his life as a construction worker. He denies any use of recreational drugs or excess alcohol."
Stroke,2,86,Subjective:  Mrs. Annie Johnson is a 71-year-old African American female presenting to the emergency room. The patient is brought in by her daughter  who noticed sudden slowness in her speech and weakness on the right side of her body  which onset approximately an hour prior to arrival. The patient denies any kind of chest pain or difficulty in breathing. However  she mentioned that she has been recently experiencing episodes of dizziness and severe headaches.  Objective:  Patient vitals signs reveal: BP 160/98 mmHg  HR 98 bpm  RR 18 breaths per minute  Temp 98.6°F  Oxygen Saturation 95% on room air. Neurological Examination shows that the patient has impaired tongue movement and drooping of right side of the face. Motor strength is 2/5 on the right upper and lower extremity. No sensory loss identified. Reflexes are 1+ in bilateral lower extremities  brisker on left than right.  Assessment:  Impressions include Acute Ischemic Stroke  Hypertension  and potentially undiagnosed Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).  Background/Past medical history:  Mrs. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and has been non-compliant with her medications. There's no known history of diabetes  heart diseases or prior stroke. She has a known allergy to penicillin. She's a former smoker and quit about 20 years ago. She denies any alcohol or recreational drug use. Her father died of stroke at the age of 75.  Plan:  Immediate CT scan was advised to determine the type of stroke and to rule out hemorrhage. Her high blood pressure should be treated promptly. A lipid profile will be checked to ascertain the levels and consider the need for statin therapy. An ECG will be done to check for any heart irregularities. Ischemic stroke treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is considered. After dealing with the immediate stroke event  a long-term plan to control the patient's blood pressure will be discussed as well.
Stroke,2,87,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Smith  a 72-year-old African American female with a significant past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  presents to the Emergency Department accompanied by her daughter. She was reportedly in her normal health until this morning when her daughter found her to be confused and speaking nonsensically. Ms. Smith’s speech was found to be slurred and she was also noted to have right-sided facial droop and weakness in her right arm. She has never had similar symptoms in the past.   Ms. Smith’s has been compliant with her hypertension and diabetes medications. She has had no recent surgeries or hospital admissions. She does not smoke or drink and lives alone at home  without any mobility issues up until now. There is no family history of stroke or any other neurological diseases.   She has a blood pressure of 170/90  pulse of 78  respiratory rate of 16 and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Neurological examination showed right-sided upper motor neurone facial palsy  moderate aphasia and right hemiparesis (4/5 strength on the right versus 5/5 on the left). All relevant labs including coagulation profile are being processed at the lab.   The patient’s symptoms  history  and examination are suggestive of an acute left hemispheric cerebrovascular accident  also known as ischemic stroke. She is under evaluation for possible stroke thrombolysis pending imaging and laboratory results.
Stroke,2,88,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Martinez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department accompanied by his wife. He complains of a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech starting approximately 2 hours ago. He reports no prior similar episodes. Mr. Martinez has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia while he has no history of pervious stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA). He quit smoking about 10 years ago  is not an alcohol consumer  and continues to take his medications regularly namely Amlodipine  Metformin  and a statin. There's no family history of stroke.  His initial blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg; heart rate was regular at 80 beats/min; body mass index (BMI) was 31; blood glucose was 200 mg/dL  and his neurological examination was significant for expressive aphasia and right upper and lower limb hemiparesis. He denies any associated symptoms like headache  seizure  vision changes  or chest pain.   It's noteworthy that stroke is leading cause of adult disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Minority racial and ethnic groups in the United States  including Hispanics  are disproportionately affected by stroke and its associated complications. This accounts for significant healthcare disparities observed. Mr. Martinez's age  male gender  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  obesity  and ethnicity are all commonly associated risk factors for stroke.
Stroke,2,89,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Ernesto Gomez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with acute-onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech. The symptoms started abruptly about two hours ago while he was at home. His wife noticed him slumping over and experiencing difficulty speaking  which prompted them to immediately come to the hospital. Mr. Gomez denies any headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  or incontinence. He reports a mild discomfort in the chest which started after the incident.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago. He consistently takes his prescribed medication  namely Metformin for diabetes  and Lisinopril and Atorvastatin for hypertension and hyperlipidemia respectively. He also notes a family history of stroke  with his father having suffered a stroke at the age of 65.   On arrival  his vitals are: Blood pressure: 160/90 mmHg  Pulse: 88/min  Respiratory rate: 18/min  Temperature: 98.6°F  Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air.   A detailed neurologic exam reveals moderate left facial droop  left upper limb drift  and reduced power in the left upper and lower limbs. His speech is slurry and he is having difficulty in understanding commands. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.   Given the sudden onset of symptoms and their persistent nature  a stroke is considered. An emergent Computerized Tomography (CT) of the head is planned to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. Based on his presentation and past medical history  we have a high degree of clinical suspicion for ischemic stroke. The patient will be evaluated for thrombolytic therapy eligibility based on neuroimaging findings  symptom onset time frame  and his overall clinical condition.
Stroke,2,90,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Sanchez is a 65-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the ER with sudden-onset left-sided weakness and slurring of speech. The symptoms have been ongoing for about two hours.   The patient is right-handed and was initially in his usual state of health this morning. He states he was making breakfast when he suddenly felt weakness on his left side causing him to drop the pan he was holding. He managed to call 911 using his right hand. Apart from muscle weakness  he also noticed that his speech has become slurred  and he is having difficulty swallowing.   Mr. Sanchez is a retired construction worker  and he lives with his wife and one of his adult children  who both report having noticed recent forgetfulness and frequent episodes of headaches for the past two weeks  which Mr. Sanchez dismissed as being due to stress.   He has had hypertension for the past ten years; however  it has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent medication intake. He has been on Lisinopril 20 mg daily but admits to skipping his medication sometimes due to forgetfulness.   He is a former smoker and stopped smoking about 15 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially. Family history is significant for a mother and brother who both had a stroke in their 70s.   In the ER  his vital signs are recorded  which include a blood pressure reading of 180/110mmHg  a pulse rate of 92 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation 98% on room air  and body temperature at 98.6 F (37 C).   Neurological examination reveals expressive aphasia  right-sided facial droop  decreased strength and sensation in the left upper and lower extremities. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Emergency CT head was done  which revealed a right middle cerebral artery occlusion  and the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. Thrombolytic therapy was initiated immediately  and the patient was admitted for further management and rehabilitation. 
Stroke,2,91,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old African American male presents to the Emergency Department with significant right-sided weakness and slurred speech. The symptoms started suddenly around 45 minutes before arrival. His daughter  who lives with him  noted he was even unable to hold his coffee cup with his right hand.   She denies him having any fever  chest pain  difficulty breathing  or other acute complaints. He does not have any prior history of similar symptoms. No recent head trauma  loss of consciousness  seizures  or any other significant symptoms.  Demographics and Personal History:  The patient is a retired school teacher  lives with his daughter since his wife passed away 2 years ago  and is relatively independent in his daily activities. He is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate alcohol intake.   Past Medical History:  He is known to have hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are controlled through medication. There is also a significant past medical history of hyperlipidemia. His medications include lisinopril  metformin  and atorvastatin. He is compliant with his medication regimen. He has no known allergies. No previous surgeries.  Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases; the patient’s father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. His elder brother has been living with chronic heart failure.  Review of Systems:  He has never experienced similar symptoms before  and there is no known history of transient ischemic attacks  migraines  or other neurologic conditions. The patient does have occasional episodes of vertigo  but they are usually relieved with rest.  This presentation suggests that this patient has suffered from an acute ischemic stroke. Immediate measures need to be taken to prevent further neurologic damage and to confirm the diagnosis with a CT scan to exclude hemorrhage. This patient is within the window for possible thrombolytic therapy  if indicated. His history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia demonstrate that he is at elevated risk for atherosclerosis  which can lead to cerebrovascular accidents like strokes. 
Stroke,2,92,Patient Presentation:   The patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 72-year-old African American male  who has been brought into the emergency department by his wife.   History:   According to his wife  Mr. Smith had sudden onset of symptoms approximately 1 hour ago while at home  including weakness of the right upper and lower limbs  difficulty in speaking  and difficulty in maintaining balance. There was no noted trauma or injury. His wife denies any recent illnesses or surgeries.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which are both currently managed with medications. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and was prescribed statins several years ago but his compliance with medications has been inconsistent.   Mr. Smith has a remote history of smoking but quit 20 years ago and he occasionally consumes alcohol.  The patient has no known history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. He has been also noncompliant with follow-up appointments with his primary care provider according to his wife.   Family history includes a mother with a stroke at age 78 and a father who suffered from coronary artery disease.  Medications:   Mr. Smith regularly takes Losartan 50mg QD for his hypertension and Metformin 500mg BID for his diabetes.  No known drug allergies.   Summary:  Mr. Smith is an elderly African American male with significant risk factors for stroke including advanced age  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. His risk is also compounded by his lack of medication compliance and periodic medical follow-up. This joint with his acute onset of relevant symptoms gives a strong suspicion for an acute stroke. Further diagnostic testing  including a CT scan  is vital to confirm diagnosis and determine optimal treatment for Mr. Smith.
Stroke,2,93,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African American male  was brought to the emergency department by his wife. She reports that her husband had sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking and understanding spoken language about an hour ago which was progressive in nature. The symptoms were associated with severe headache and dizziness preceding it.   Mr. Johnson has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia for which he has been tardy in regular follow-ups. His medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin.  His family history reveals that his father had a stroke at the age of 75 years. He is a lifetime nonsmoker and denies any illicit drug use. His diet primarily consists of high sodium food. He has retired from his job as a truck driver and lives with his wife. He has an elder brother who takes care of his medications.  However  recently due to the pandemic  he has not been able to meet him hence could not take his antihypertensives for a week. His vitals on arrival are blood pressure of 178/95 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 per minute  temperature 98.7 F  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. The Cincinnati Pre-Hospital Stroke Scale was performed and he was found to have facial droop  dysarthria  and right arm weakness.  In the emergency department  he was urgently evaluated for perspective administration of intravenous tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) and possible mechanical thrombectomy depending upon the findings of brain imaging studies. His NIH stroke scale was calculated to be 12 on arrival.  Given the aforementioned history and presentation  the likely diagnosis at this point is acute ischemic stroke.
Stroke,2,94,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Johnson is a 65-year-old African American woman who comes to the emergency department with her daughter. The primary complaints as reported by her daughter are sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speech  that started approximately two-hours ago. The patient demonstrated noticeable facial drooping on her right side and slurred speech during initial assessment.   Medical History:   Ms. Johnson has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been a smoker for about 35 years. She was non-compliant with her antihypertensive and oral hypoglycemic medications due to her low socio-economic status which has limited her access to regular healthcare. There is no known history of allergies.  Family history includes her mother who suffered a stroke at the age of 72 and her father with a history of coronary artery disease.   In social characteristics  Ms. Johnson is retired  lives alone  and is usually looked after by her daughter. She doesn't consume alcohol.   Recent History:   Over the past week  her daughter reported that Ms. Johnson complained of experiencing transient episodes of numbness in her right hand which lasted for a few minutes. However  she didn't seek medical attention as they thought it was due to her diabetes.   Considering Ms. Johnson's demographics  medical history  recent history  and presenting symptoms  she fits within the spectrum of high-risk populations for stroke as described in literature. Her African American ethnicity  age  history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking status are all contributing factors to her stroke risk. High levels of non-compliance and limited access to healthcare services  compounded with her demographic and clinical risk factors  exemplify her vulnerability to a stroke event.
Stroke,2,95,Patient Presentation: Mr. Lyons is a 72-year-old African American male who presents the  emergency department with complaints of sudden onset  right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started approximately one hour ago while he was watching television at home. He denies any symptoms such as headache  confusion  blurring of vision  or loss of balance. His past history is significant for hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  high cholesterol  and a 20 pack-year smoking history. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. Mr. Lyons claims compliance with his medications  but admits he recently ran out of his secondary hypertension medication  amlodipine  last week but did not refill the prescription. His mother had a stroke in her mid-70s. He denies any alcohol or drug use.  This presentation was constructed considering the fact that stroke is more prevalent in those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  and smoking. Moreover  African American males are disproportionately afflicted by stroke  and there is a significant number of strokes in people over 70 years of age. The patient's non-compliance with his blood pressure medications further adds to his risk factor profile.
Stroke,2,96,Patient Presentation  A 67-year-old African American female patient presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech beginning two hours prior to admission. She also complained of a sudden severe headache that started at the same time  no report of loss of consciousness  or confusion.  Her past medical history includes hypertension for which she was taking Losartan 50mg daily  type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin 850mg twice daily  and hyperlipidemia  for which she was on Atorvastatin 20mg once daily. According to patient's self-report  she is currently compliant with all her medication. However  despite pharmacologic intervention  her blood pressure and glucose levels had been sub-optimally controlled. She also reports to have quit smoking 10 years ago.  Her mother had a stroke at the age of 70 and passed away at 72 due to a second stroke. Her father had coronary heart disease and died at the age of 75. She has two older siblings who are alive and well with no known genetic diseases. Regarding her lifestyle  she admits to leading a sedentary lifestyle and doesn't exercise due to arthritis pain in her knee. Her diet consists mostly of fast foods due to her busy lifestyle.  Based on the above history  physical examination  and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 12  she was diagnosed as a probable case of acute ischemic stroke. A CT scan of her head was ordered for confirmation.  This presentation is typical for the reported demographic as African-American individuals have a significantly higher risk of stroke than Caucasians  and women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Risk factors such as family history  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and prior smoking are also important contributors.
Stroke,2,97,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Johnson  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech which began about two hours ago. Additionally  his wife reports noticing her husband’s facial asymmetry and recalls him complaining about mild headache and dizziness  while they were having breakfast today.  The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he is on daily atenolol and atorvastatin  respectively. However  he admits of occasional non-compliance to his medication. He also has a 45-pack-year smoking history and consumes alcohol moderately. There's no history of any surgeries and no known drug allergies.  Apart from his son who had a myocardial infarction at 52  his family medical history is non-contributory. The patient's last valid neurological check was normal 3 hours ago.  On examination  the patient appears conscious but frightened. Vitals reveal a blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  heart rate of 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Neurologically  he exhibits right upper and lower limb weakness with a power of 3/5  global aphasia  right-sided facial droop  and is oriented to person only.  Given his symptoms  past medical history  and current presentation  there is a high index of suspicion for ischemic stroke. Immediate actions would include maintaining airway  breathing  and circulation  after which he would be due for further evaluation via CT scan to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and later commence appropriate management. Meanwhile  the neurologist is already informed and a stroke team is prepared for a possible thrombolytic intervention.
Stroke,2,98,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 66 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired lawyer  Mr. Smith presented to the Emergency Department in a wheelchair  accompanied by his daughter. He appeared alert but visibly distressed. The daughter reported a sudden onset of her father's symptoms including right-sided weakness and slurred speech while they were having their breakfast. This was not associated with a headache  loss of consciousness  or convulsions. The symptoms had been present for about two hours prior to presentation.  Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which he has managed with medications (losartan and metformin respectively) for the past 15 years. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and received two coronary stents at that time. He quit smoking 5 years ago after a pack-a-day history for nearly 40 years. He has been living alone since the death of his wife 2 years ago. His mother had a stroke at the age of 82. He rarely exercises and his diet is largely based on processed foods  as per the daughter's report.  Vital signs are within normal ranges except for elevated blood pressure (170/95 mmHg). A quick neurological examination revealed mild dysarthria and a right-sided hemiparesis which was severe in the upper limb. Otherwise  no cranial nerve deficit  sensory disturbance  or coordination problems were detected. Immediate CT scan is arranged to further evaluate his symptoms.
Stroke,2,99,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old African-American male presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty walking  which started about two hours ago while he was having breakfast. He lives alone and managed to call 911 after recognizing his symptoms as possible signs of a stroke.  He has a known history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which have been fairly well-managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensives.  He is a former smoker  quitting about 15 years ago  and reports moderate alcohol intake. He reports no recreational drug use. He is retired and previously worked in construction.  He has no known allergies. His paternal grandmother and father both had a history of stroke in their late 60s.  On admission  his blood pressure is recorded as 165/90 mmHg  his pulse is 75 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute  and his oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.   The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated  possibly indicating insufficient medication management. The lipid profile also suggests high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  indicating a possible risk for atherosclerosis.  A head CT is immediately ordered to rule out hemorrhagic stroke.
Stroke,2,100,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Dona Santos  a 62-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the emergency room with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  speech difficulties and facial droop that began approximately two hours ago. She was reportedly watching TV at home when her symptoms suddenly started.   On examination  her blood pressure is noted to be 170/90mmHg  pulse 82 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  temperature 98.6F and SpO2 96% on room air. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 14.   She has a history of controlled hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ms. Santos' medications include daily doses of Lisinopril and Metformin. She quit smoking 10 years ago and denies any history of drug or alcohol abuse. She also denies any history of clotting disorders  cardiovascular disease  or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She lives alone but has a son who helps her with groceries and appointments.   Her father had a history of stroke in his late 70s. No history of strokes or seizures in siblings or children. Her last routine check-up approximately six months ago showed controlled blood sugar levels and blood pressure.   She maintains a healthy diet but is sedentary due to a knee injury and subsequent surgery five years back  which limits her mobility. She has no known drug allergies. This is her first episode of such kind.   On physical examination  she was found to have right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia. An urgent CT head without contrast revealed a large area of hypoattenuation consistent with an acute ischemic stroke. Her NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12  indicating a moderate severity stroke.  Based on her age  gender  and the fact that strokes are more common in people with her constellation of risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  family history of stroke  and sedentary lifestyle) Ms. Santos' presentation is representative of a typical acute stroke patient.
Stroke,3,1,Title: Stroke Case Study for Medical Education   Patient Demographics: - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired Engineer  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 15 years  medication-controlled - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  managed with insulin and diet - Smoking history of 20 years  ceased 5 years ago - Moderate alcohol intake  Presentation:  Mr. J  a 65-year-old retired engineer  presented with sudden onset articulation difficulty and right side weakness primarily affecting the lower limb. He lives with his wife who witnessed the episode and sought immediate medical attention. This patient is African American  reflecting the fact that African Americans have nearly twice the risk of a first-ever stroke as compared to Caucasians.  His significant past medical history includes long-standing hypertension  optimally controlled with amlodipine  and type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with insulin and dietary modifications. He also has a history of smoking for about 20 years but quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol in a moderate amount. Both hypertension and diabetes have been frequently reported in literature as major predisposing factors for stroke.  On admission  physical examination showed a blood pressure of 162/94 mmHg and a blood glucose of 190 mg/dL. Neurological examination revealed evidence of mild aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis with a power of 3/5 in the right lower extremity  and 4/5 in the right upper extremity  confirming his wife's observations. Given the patient's report of relatively sudden onset of symptoms that morning  ischemic stroke was suspected.  Patients like Mr. J  with longstanding hypertension  and diabetes are at a high risk of stroke  especially when paired with a history of smoking  even if cessation has occurred. As such  further diagnostic tests including MRI brain imaging and blood tests for coagulation profile  kidney function and cholesterol levels will be conducted for Mr J. With stroke identification and treatment being time critical  immediate management plan would include controlling the blood pressure  blood glucose  and possibly thrombolytic therapy based on further evaluations.
Stroke,3,2,Title: Cerebrovascular Accident Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Helene  a 73-year-old African-American female  represents 1 of the 795 000 individuals who have a new or recurrent stroke each year in the USA. African-Americans are 50% more likely to suffer a stroke compared to their counterparts  with women consistently higher than men.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Helene had been hypertensive for the past 20 years  had a 15-year history of type II diabetes mellitus  and was obese. She recalled her doctor mentioning something about ‘mild atrial fibrillation’ in her last cardiology review  but she presumed it was of no importance.  Slide 3: Presentation She was found by a family member at home  unable to lift her right arm and with slurred speech  manifesting signs of acute stroke. There was no recent history of head trauma or anticoagulant usage.  Slide 4: Physical Examination On physical examination  she weighed 95 kg  her blood pressure was 165/95mmHg  her pulse was irregular and slow  and her Glasgow Coma Scale was 12/15. She had right-sided facial dropped  right arm weakness  and slurred speech  yielding a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 6.  Slide 5: Investigations An emergency CT brain was conducted  showing no hemorrhage  confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. An EKG confirmed atrial fibrillation.  Slide 6: Diagnosis & Treatment Helene was diagnosed with Acute Ischemic Stroke possibly secondary to cardioembolic causes  given her age  sex  ethnicity  atrial fibrillation  hypertension  and diabetes. IV thrombolysis with tPA was initiated within the time window of 4.5 hours  and she was admitted for further management.  Slide 7: Secondary Prevention Also vital in Helene's management is secondary prevention  including blood pressure control  lipid-lowering therapy  tight glycemic control  antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation  and lifestyle modification  including diet and weight reduction.  Slide 8: Outcome & Follow Up She showed some signs of speech and motor improvement  but the rehabilitation process will be ongoing  helped with speech and occupational therapy. Anticoagulation was initiated to manage atrial fibrillation.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case exposes the interplay of demographic factors  chronic diseases  and lifestyle choices in the etiology of stroke. It emphasizes how crucial prompt treatment and secondary preventative strategies are for positive outcomes in stroke patients.

We shall delve into his pertinent medical history  symptoms  examination  and plan management.  Slide 2: Demographics Mr. Smith lives in Detroit  Michigan  and is a retired factory worker. African-American individuals like Mr. Smith are statistically more likely to suffer strokes than their white counterparts  displaying the impact of ethnicity on stroke prevalence.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Smith is hypertensive and diabetic  controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensive medications. Both conditions are leading risk factors for strokes. Mr. Smith is also a former smoker  having quit five years ago.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaints Mr. Smith was brought to the emergency department by his daughter after noticing significant weakness on the right side of his body and slurred speech  which commenced earlier that morning.   Slide 5: Physical Examination  On examination  Mr. Smith displayed right-sided facial droop  dysphasia and hemiparesis - classic signs of stroke. His vitals revealed a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg and a blood glucose level of 190mg/dl.   Slide 6: Investigations A CT scan confirmed an ischemic stroke in the left cerebral hemisphere. The EKG revealed no current evidence of ischemia  arrhythmia or previous MI. Labs showed elevated HbA1c suggesting poor control of diabetes.  Slide 7: Discussion Mr. Smith was administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within the approved time window from symptom onset and prescribed antihypertensives and antiplatelet drugs. He was referred to speech therapy and physiotherapy.  Slide 8: Conclusion Mr. Smith's case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and management of stroke  the significance of managing modifiable risk factors for stroke such as hypertension and diabetes  and the role of rehabilitation therapy in improving patients' post-stroke quality of life.
Stroke,3,6,Title: A Clove to Stroke: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction   This presentation will discuss a case study of a patient who suffered a stroke  incorporating the patient's demographics and past medical history.  Slide 2: Demographics  Our patient is a 68-year-old African American female  from a lower socio-economic background residing in an urban area. She is retired and widowed  living alone  with two adult children serving as caregivers.   Slide 3: Stroke Demographic Relevance  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  stroke is more common among older adults and African Americans. Following age-gender-race adjustment  stroke mortality is highest among people of non-Hispanic Black race.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  She has a medical history of hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2  which are important risk factors for stroke. She was diagnosed with hypertension 25 years ago and DM2 10 years ago. She’s a non-smoker but has a history of passive smoking due to her late husband's smoking habits.  Slide 5: Presentation & Diagnosis  She arrived at the hospital with symptoms of sudden numbness on the right side of her body  confusing speech and difficulty walking  which are hallmark symptoms of stroke. After a series of tests including a CT Scan  she was diagnosed with Ischemic stroke.   Slide 6: Stroke Risk Factors  The patient's previous medical history  age  race  sedentary lifestyle  and inadequate control of her hypertension and DM2  significantly contributed to her stroke risk.   Slide 7: Intervention & Outcomes  The patient was promptly given an intravenous thrombolytic -- Alteplase  to help dissolve the blood clot causing her stroke. She was later admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and further treatment.  Slide 8: Preventive Measures  Strict control of her blood pressure and blood glucose levels  an improved diet  increased physical activity  and regular medical check-ups are essential to prevent another stroke occurrence.  Slide 9: Conclusion  This case illustrates the vital need for effective stroke prevention strategies  including lifestyle modifications and better management of hypertension and diabetes in high-risk individuals.

Stroke,3,11,Title: Cerebrovascular Event: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  Patient: Mrs. Elizabeth  a 75-year-old Caucasian female from a suburban community  presenting with symptoms of acute onset right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking.   Slide 2: Medical History Mrs. Elizabeth is a retired school teacher with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Despite being prescribed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications  she expresses difficulty with medication compliance due to its cost. She has been a non-smoker throughout her life and occasionally consumes alcohol. There is a family history of stroke on her maternal side.    Slide 3: Past Stroke Statistics & Demographics Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. Every 40 seconds  someone in the U.S. has a stroke. The risk of stroke increases with age  especially after 55 and the risk doubles each decade after 55. Gender-wise  women are more likely than men to have a stroke. Moreover  genetics and race play roles as well.   Slide 4: Presentation and Physical Examination   Mrs. Elizabeth arrived at the emergency department approximately 90 minutes after her symptom’s onset. On arrival  she had a blood pressure of 188/94 mmHg  heart rate of 82 bpm  temperature of 36.7°C  and her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Examination revealed a right facial droop  right upper and lower extremity weakness  and slurred speech indicating a likely left hemisphere stroke.  Slide 5: Investigations & Diagnosis  Primary investigations including a CT scan of the brain were suggestive of an ischemic stroke. Subsequent MRI showed an acute infarct in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. Other diagnostic tests included a chest X-ray and ECG  to rule out atrial fibrillation as a potential cause.   Slide 6: Management & Conclusion   The patient was given intravenous Thrombolysis  as she was within the recommended window period for treatment. Antiplatelet  antihypertensives  and statin therapies were optimized. The patient was subsequently enrolled in a stroke rehabilitation program.

This study aims at showcasing the treatment approach  preventive measures  and follow-up practices for stroke patients.  Slide 2: Demographics African-Americans are disproportionately affected by stroke  with a 50% higher death rate due to strokes compared to Caucasians. Moreover  Stroke is the third leading cause of death in women  and approximately 55 000 more women than men experience a stroke each year.  Slide 3: Previous Medical History Mrs. Anderson previously experienced hypertension and diabetes type 2. Her family history indicates relatives with stroke and cardiovascular diseases. She has a record of medication non-compliance due to side effects and occasionally indulges in alcohol and tobacco use.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms Upon arriving at the ER  Mrs. Anderson presented confusion  sudden trouble walking  dizziness  loss of balance  and severe headache with no known cause — all symptoms consistent with stroke.  Slide 5: Diagnosis  A CT scan of the brain indicated a loss of blood flow to the left anterior cerebral artery region  suggesting a ischemic stroke. A neurological examination showed right-sided paralysis and speech difficulty  corroborating the CT scan results.  Slide 6: Treatment  Mrs. Anderson received tissue Plasminogen activator (tPA) as part of the acute management. Furthermore  she was referred to physical  occupational  and speech therapy sessions to help manage her deficits. Antihypertensive treatment and strict glycemic control are achieved for better prognosis.   Slide 7: Prognosis & Prevention With early intervention and consistent therapy  the patient showed significant improvement but persisting impairments  common in stroke rehabilitation. Lifestyle modifications  including controlled diet  regular exercise  cessation of alcohol and tobacco  and medication compliance particularly targeting her hypertension and diabetes  were encouraged to prevent recurrences.  Slide 8: Conclusion Stroke continues to be a challenging health issue  especially among African American women. Adopting healthier lifestyle choices  ensuring medication adherence  and encouraging regular medical checkups are paramount for early detection and better disease management.

Stroke,3,47,Title: Understanding the Impact of Stroke on Elderly African-American male  Slide 1: Introduction Stroke is a debilitating illness affecting millions of individuals globally  with demographic factors such as age  sex  and race playing vital roles in incidence rates. Today's case discusses a 72-year-old Male patient  Mr. Johnson  from an African-American ethnicity - a group that statistically has higher stroke rates than other racial groups.  Slide 2: Background information Demographics: 72-Year old African-American male living in an urban environment. Past Medical History: Type II Diabetes  Hypertension (for which he takes medication)  occasional tobacco use  rarely exercises.  Slide 3: Quantifying risk According to the CDC  African-Americans are significantly more likely to experience stroke  with hypertension and diabetes serving as crucial risk factors. Further  studies demonstrate that people older than 60 are more likely to suffer from strokes.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms Mr. Johnson was found unresponsive in his apartment. On arrival at the hospital  he was displaying common stroke symptoms - right-sided hemiparesis  facial droop  and slurred speech.  Slide 5: Immediate Response /Management The clinical team assessed Mr. Johnson using the FAST (Face  Arms  Speech  and Time) test  confirming a loss of regular function and crucially  the time of onset of symptoms. A CT scan was ordered to appraise the type and location of the stroke  guiding immediate treatment approach.  Slide 6: Course of treatment Post confirmation of an ischemic stroke  thrombolytic therapy was initiated using IV rt-PA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) within the optimal time window. Alongside this  his diabetes and hypertension are being carefully managed.  Slide 7: Rehabilitation Once stable  Mr. Johnson was moved to a rehabilitation unit for physical  occupational  and speech-language therapy  relying on a multidisciplinary approach to maximize recovery.  Slide 8: Case Discussion In summary  Mr. Johnson's case aligns well with the demographic risk factors and medical predictors  highlighting the value of preventative care  early recognition and timely treatment in patients at risk for stroke.  Slide 9: Conclusion  Aging individuals  particularly from African-American ethnicity with underlying conditions like hypertension and diabetes are at a higher risk of stroke. Healthcare practitioners must be cognizant of these facts and base their care regimens accordingly. They should also focus on educating these at-risk demographics about stroke signs and the importance of quick response times.

Stroke,3,56,Title: Clinical Case Study: Stroke Patient  Slide 1: Introduction In this case study  we will be discussing a 65-year-old African-American male who suffered a stroke. Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a retired teacher who lives with his wife. According to the American Heart Association  African-American men are more prone to strokes compared to their white  Asian  or Hispanic counterparts.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson  was previously diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are known risk factors for stroke. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. His weight and sedentary lifestyle suggests he also has obesity  a common comorbidity with type 2 diabetes. He has been regularly taking prescribed medication for his diabetic and hypertensive conditions.   Slide 3: Presenting Complaints  Mr. Johnson was brought to the emergency room experiencing sudden weakness on the right side of the body  difficulty speaking  and loss of balance. The symptoms started abruptly an hour prior to his arrival at the hospital.   Slide 4: Examination Findings Physical examination showed a blood pressure reading of 180/95 mm Hg. The neurologic examination revealed the right-sided facial droop  expressive aphasia  and right-side body weakness indicative of left-hemisphere stroke.   Slide 5: Diagnosis The mentioned symptoms and relevant medical history pointed to the possibility of a stroke. Medical imaging (CT scan) confirmed the presence of a left MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) ischemic stroke.   Slide 6: Management & Prognosis Mr. Johnson was immediately started on IV thrombolytics (tPA) for clot dissolution. Post-stroke rehabilitation was recommended along with a referral to a dietitian for dietary management. The prognosis is guarded due to his multiple comorbid conditions.   Slide 7: Conclusion Preventative strategies should focus on the control of hypertension and diabetes to reduce the incidence of stroke in such high-risk individuals. Additionally  immediate intervention upon the onset of stroke symptoms is critical in limiting the extent of brain damage and improving recovery outcomes.

Stroke,3,71,Presentation: Case Study of a Stroke Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Title: A patient with stroke: A case study  Slide 2: Demographics According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. and is more common in older adults above 65 years of age. The patient in this case study represents a common demographic: A 72-year-old African American male. African Americans are more likely to have a stroke than any other racial or ethnic group  and males are slightly more likely to suffer a stroke than females.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history that puts him at increased risk for stroke. Prior to the stroke diagnosis  the patient had a 10-year history of hypertension and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago. Both these conditions are major risk factors for stroke and are more prevalent in the African American community. The patient also has a history of smoking and high cholesterol  both further adding to the patient’s predisposition to stroke.  Slide 4: Presentation of Stroke The patient arrived at the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset of left-side weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty in swallowing. Besides  he complained of a sudden severe headache  dizziness  and loss of balance.  Slide 5: Diagnosis A clinical examination and imaging studies (CT/MRI Scan) confirmed that the patient had experienced an ischemic stroke  the most common type of stroke  which occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked.  Slide 6: Prognosis and Management The prognosis for the patient depends largely on the time from stroke onset to treatment  the size of the stroke  and the patient’s overall health status. The patient received immediate thrombolytic therapy  aiming to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the brain. In addition  he has been started on secondary preventive measures  including antihypertensives  statins  and antidiabetic medications along with lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  healthy diet  and regular physical activity.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case reinforces the importance of modifiable risk factors in stroke prevention. Regular monitoring and effective control of hypertension and diabetes  as well as cessation of smoking  are vital for preventing strokes  especially in high-risk groups.
Stroke,3,72,Title: Case Presentation: Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) in a African American Male   Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will discuss the case of a 65-year-old African American male diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Literature shows that stroke incidence is disproportionally higher in African Americans compared to other ethnicities  and men are at a slightly higher risk than women  emphasizing the importance of this case's demographic accuracy.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mr. X  is a 65-year-old African American retired military veteran residing in the urban setting of Chicago  Illinois. He is a widower and lives alone. He seeks medical attention due to sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speech.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. X's past medical history is notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These conditions have been poorly controlled due to inconsistent medication management. He is also a former smoker  with a history of 30 pack-years of usage. His family history is significant for hypertensive cardiovascular disease and stroke.  Slide 4: Hypertension and Diabetes Hypertension and diabetes are recognized as leading risk factors for stroke  both individually and synergistically. In particular  African Americans experience a higher prevalence rate of hypertension than other ethnic groups  contributing to a higher stroke incidence. Former smoking history further elevates Mr. X's stroke risk.  Slide 5: Symptoms and Care-Seeking Behaviour Mr. X experienced sudden weakness in his right arm and leg  along with slurred speech - classical symptoms of stroke. Despite living alone  an immediate call to 911 ensured he reached emergency medical care within the ‘Golden Hour’  which is crucial for inhibiting the progress of a stroke and reducing permanent damage.  Slide 6: Diagnosis and Management  Based on clinical evaluation and a positive brain CT scan indicating a blockage in a major artery within his brain  Mr. X was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. He was immediately started on a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  which can greatly reduce the disability caused by stroke if administered within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms.

Stroke,3,96,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: A Case of Ischemic Stroke: Mrs. Jackson's Story  Slide 2: Demographics & Background  Mrs. Jackson  aged 68  is an African-American woman  from Lowell  Massachusetts  USA. Her ethnic background is particularly significant because African-Americans are more likely to experience stroke than any other racial groups in the U.S.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mrs. Jackson is a retired school teacher with no active lifestyle. She has a past medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes that have not been adequately managed due to inconsistency in taking her medication. Her BMI places her in the overweight bracket.  Slide 4: Precursor Conditions to Stroke   As per extensive literature  her pre-existing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus increase her risk of suffering a stroke. Hypertension is known to cause damaging of blood vessels which restricts blood flow to the brain  leading to stroke  while diabetes  particularly when unmanaged  can accelerate the formation of artery-clogging plaques  also causing stroke.  Slide 5: MRS. Jackson's Stroke  Mrs. Jackson experienced sudden severe headache  confusion  difficulty speaking  visual problems  and right-sided numbness and was rushed to the hospital where a diagnosis of left hemisphere ischemic stroke was made.  Slide 6: Stroke Statistics   Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the United States. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke compared to men  and the risk increases with age  particularly above the age of 60.   Slide 7: Prevention and Management   Focus would be placed on managing Mrs. Jackson's risk factors  primarily her hypertension and diabetes to help prevent recurrence. Adherence to her medication would be reinforced and she may need to consider lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking  limiting her alcohol  a heart-healthy diet and incorporating exercise into her daily routine.   Slide 8: Conclusion  As Mrs. Jackson's case shows  it is vital to manage chronic health conditions to prevent health complications such as stroke. Regular medical check-ups  adherence to medication  and a healthy lifestyle are crucial in controlling health risk factors. It emphasizes the importance of health education and preventive measures in mitigating the adverse effects of these conditions.
Stroke,3,97,Title: Case Study: Stroke in an Elderly African American Patient  Slide 1: Introduction This presentation discusses a case of an elderly African American male patient who suffered a stroke. The demographic characteristics of the patient have been chosen based on the literature documenting higher incidence and mortality rates of stroke among older African American individuals.  Slide 2: Patient's Demographics Mr. Jones is an 82-year old African American male residing at a senior living community in Atlanta  Georgia. His lifestyle includes a low activity level  with rare exceptions for attending weekly church services and engagements with his grandkids. He is a former smoker and has a history of hypertension and diabetes type 2.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History  Mr. Jones has been diagnosed with Hypertension for the past 20 years which has been marginally managed with medication. He has also been managing Diabetes Type 2 for a decade. Six months ago  he was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation  a condition known for increasing stroke risk.   Slide 4: Stroke Onset  Mr. Jones experienced sudden onset of weakness on his right side  difficulty speaking  and loss of balance. These symptoms persisted  prompting his neighbor to call 911.  Slide 5: Hospital Admission Upon arrival at the ER  symptoms suggested a left-hemispheric ischemic stroke. Initial NIH Stroke Scale score was 15  indicating a moderate to severe stroke. A CT scan confirmed the absence of hemorrhage  therefore IV t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) was administered within the therapeutic time window.  Slide 6: Hospital Course Despite the IV t-PA treatment  patient’s symptoms did not improve significantly over subsequent hours  revealing a large vessel occlusion. He underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy 6 hours post initial symptoms onset.  Slide 7: Rehabilitation & Outcome Post stroke  Mr. Jones was transferred to the Stroke Rehabilitation Unit. His progress was significant  albeit slow; he regained some movement and speech  but still needed assistance for daily living activities.   Slide 8: Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment of stroke  which significantly impact the outcome. It also highlights issues related to higher stroke prevalence in African American population and the importance of monitoring and treating critical vascular risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation.

Stroke,5,15,Patient Information: 72-year-old African American male.  Medical History: Known case of poorly controlled hypertension for the last 10 years. Past medical history also includes Type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-year history of smoking.   Presenting Complaints: Patient presents with an acute onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and headache - symptoms present for approximately 2 hours before arrival in the emergency room. He also provides a history of difficulty with vision in the left eye and sudden dizziness. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.  Assessment & Analysis: Based on his acute presentation  age  male sex  race  and medical history of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  he is likely experiencing an ischemic stroke  possibly related to his poorly controlled risk factors. The sudden onset symptoms such as right-sided weakness  slurred speech  impaired vision in the left eye  and headache are consistent with an acute cerebrovascular event.   Plan: Immediate management includes ensuring the patient's vital signs are stable and providing supportive interventions  such as oxygen administration  if needed. The patient will urgently need neuroimaging to confirm the diagnosis and extent of the stroke. Consultation with neurology will be critically important to discuss the potential for thrombolytic therapy (t-PA) given the patient's symptoms began within the therapeutic window. His hypertension and diabetes management should also be reviewed and optimized to lower the risk of future cerebrovascular events.
Stroke,5,16,Demographics: A 68-year-old African-American male.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit ten years ago. There is a family history of ischemic stroke on the maternal side. He lives independently and is functional in performing basic activities of daily living.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulties in speaking clearly that started approximately 2 hours ago. He denies experiencing a headache  nausea  or changes in vision or level of consciousness. Upon examination  he was found to have facial droop  dysarthria  and motor weakness in the right upper and lower extremities.  This presentation is consistent with a potential left hemisphere cerebral ischemic stroke. The patient is within the treatment window (less than 4.5 hours from the onset of symptoms) for potential thrombolytic therapy  provided no contraindications are found. Immediately obtaining a brain imaging study is critical for both definitive diagnosis and treatment considerations.
Stroke,5,17,A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking that started approximately 3 hours ago. She is experiencing confusion but is conscious. She has a past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. On presenting  her blood pressure was found to be 162/94 mmHg. Her speech was slurred and she had significant strength disparity in the right upper and lower extremities compared to the left  consistent with symptoms of a stroke. She has no prior history of stroke. Her last routine physical examination  about a year ago  revealed uncontrolled blood glucose and blood pressure levels. She is a non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. She is currently on medication with Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension but admits that she forgets to take her medication on some days. She also has a family history of cerebrovascular diseases  as her father died of an ischemic stroke.
Stroke,5,18,A 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech  both starting approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. He also complains of a headache  visual disturbances  and a history of not taking his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications regularly. He does not have any history of similar episodes in the past. He has not opted for any smoking cessation programs and has 40-pack-year smoking history. His family history is significant for a brother and father suffering from stroke at an elderly age. He was found to have a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg and a blood glucose level of 220 mg/dl on arrival to ED. Neurologically he is alert but has obvious right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia on examination. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.
Stroke,5,19,A 65-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and tobacco usage presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and a difficulty in speech which started two hours ago. He has no known allergies. His family history is significant for a father who had a stroke. On presentation  he appears anxious  with noted facial asymmetry  slurred speech  and a difficulty in moving his left arm and leg. His blood pressure on admission is 180/100 mm Hg. His pulse is 80 beats per minute. No other significant findings on physical examination. His blood glucose level on arrival is 210 mg/dl. He denies headache  vision changes  or loss of consciousness.
Stroke,5,20,Patient is a 68-year-old African-American male  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  who presents with sudden-onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech. He reports awakening from sleep with these symptoms approximately 2 hours prior to presentation. He denies any headache  seizure  or loss of consciousness. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years and admits non-compliance with his prescribed antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic medications. Family history is notable for stroke in paternal relatives. On examination  patient is found to have right-sided facial droop  dysarthria  and right-sided hemiplegia. Blood pressure is 190/95 mmHg  heart rate is 92 bpm  and patient is afebrile. Urgent neuroimaging is indicated to further evaluate the possibility of stroke.
Stroke,5,21,Patient Information: 68-year-old African-American male.  Medical History:  This is a smoker with a past medical history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  well-managed with oral antihyperglycemics and ACE inhibitors.   Chief Complaint/Presentation: The patient presents with acute onset right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and facial drooping that began 2 hours ago. He denies headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  or trauma.   Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient has right-sided hemiparesis and has notable difficulty finding words but comprehension remains intact (expressive aphasia). His blood pressure is borderline high at 140/85 mmHg on presentation.  The presentation and clinical findings are a close match for ischemic stroke  potentially secondary to uncontrolled hypertension and compounded by the patient's demographic factors  medical history  and lifestyle behaviors (smoking). The onset and nature of symptoms suggest a possible left hemisphere cerebrovascular event. Immediate hospitalization  monitoring  and further intervention  as necessary  are recommended.
Stroke,5,22,Problem Representation:  A 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech for the last two hours.

Investigation: CT Brain - Awaiting report. Blood test shows elevated glucose levels and lipid profile.  Note: This problem representation is based on averages and most common occurrences in stroke patients according to research rather than an actual patient's individual presentation. Stroke can occur in any demographic  including different ages  genders  races  and individuals with differing medical histories.
Stroke,6,3,Problem Representation:  Patient: A 68-year-old African American male  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency room with several sudden onset symptoms including severe headache  unilateral facial droop  slurred speech  and weakness on the right side of his body - all classic symptoms of a potential stroke.  Demographics: The patient is retired and lives in a suburban area with his wife. He is a former smoker and quit 20 years ago. He is moderately active and tends to engage in regular physical activities like walking and gardening. However  his dietary habits are poor  often opting for fast food and high-sodium meals.  Past Medical History: The patient’s past medical history includes hypertension  which he takes medication for  but his blood pressure control has been suboptimal. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago  which is generally well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia and takes statins. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago.  Family History: His father died at the age of 72 due to a myocardial infarction and his mother had a stroke at age 70 and passed away at the age of 78 from complications related to Alzheimer’s disease.  Risk Factors: Key risk factors for this patient include his age  male gender  African American ethnicity  personal history of TIA  hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and poor dietary habits.  This case draws attention to the fact that stroke risk is higher in certain populations  including the elderly  those of African American descent  and individuals with existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. It is also more common in those with a family history of coronary artery disease or stroke.
Stroke,6,4,Patient Profile:  Patient: John Smith Age: 68 years Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired    Demographic Profile:  John is a 68-year-old African American male  living in the urban settings of Atlanta  Georgia. He is a retired engineer  living with his wife. A nonsmoker  John occasionally consumes alcohol. He has difficulty in staying active due to a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. He has been known to have uncontrolled hypertension  and a history of irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). His family history includes individuals with strokes and heart diseases.   Medical History:  - Hypertension: John has been suffering from hypertension for over 10 years. His average blood pressure reading over the last year has been 160/95 mmHg  indicating poorly controlled hypertension. - Atrial fibrillation (AF): Diagnosed 8 years ago with this condition. He has been intermittently compliant with his medication  Warfarin. - Diabetes: Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 6 years ago. It's being managed with Metformin  although with poor glycemic control (HbA1c = 8%). - Obesity: John carries excessive body weight with a recorded BMI of 32 kg/m2. - Sedentary lifestyle: John leads a sedentary lifestyle with low physical activity. - Family History: His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72 and one of his older brothers suffered a stroke at age 66.     Representation of the Problem:  John presents with an acute onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which began a couple of hours ago. Given John's age  race  hypertension  AF  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular diseases  he falls in a high-risk category for ischemic stroke. However  a detailed diagnostic workup including a neurologic examination  lab tests  brain imaging  and possibly  an evaluation of his heart is necessary to confirm a diagnosis and guide treatment. The main problem is to manage his current symptoms  stabilize him  and prevent further damage  and then to work on modifying his risk factors to prevent future events.
Stroke,6,5,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Patient is a 67-year-old African American male  retired truck driver  living with his wife and regularly active in his local community.  Presenting Issue: Patient presents with new onset acute unilateral weakness  confusion  and difficulty speaking that started approximately 3 hours ago. Patient's wife also observes slight drooping of one side of his face.  Relevant Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and high cholesterol for the past 15 years  which are being treated with Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atorvastatin 40mg daily  respectively. He has been a pack-a-day smoker for the last 35 years. In addition  he has type 2 diabetes controlled with Metformin 1000mg twice daily  diagnosed 8 years ago. Furthermore  he has a family history of stroke with his father suffering a stroke at the age of 72.  Lifestyle Factors:  The patient maintains a diet high in red meat and processed foods. His wife reports he has a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement  spending most days inside watching television or reading  with little physical activity. He drinks socially  approximately 2-3 drinks per week. He is a non-drug user.  Demographic Justification:  Researched literature suggests that African American men are at a relatively high risk of stroke  particularly if they have a family history  hypertension  diabetes  and are smokers. Age is also a significant risk factor  with stroke risk increasing after the age of 55. Sedentary lifestyles and diets high in sodium and unhealthy fats additionally contribute to stroke risk. The patient’s occupation as a truck driver could have contributed to his sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits. Therefore  this profile accurately represents a demographic at high risk for stroke as explained in medical literature.

Race: African-Americans are at higher risk for stroke due to higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. 4. Family history: John's father passed away from a stroke  he too was hypertensive.  Presenting Complaints:   Abrupt onset of unilateral weakness of right upper limb and lower limb  difficulty in speaking  and slight deviation of face towards the left.  History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  controlled on medication. Last recorded blood pressure was 140/85 mm Hg. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Diagnosed 10 years ago  on Metformin and sitagliptin. 3. Hyperlipidemia: On statins. 4. Smoking history: 20-pack years  quit 10 years ago. 5. No history of head trauma.  Signs and Symptoms: 1. Motor system examination showed right-sided hemiplegia.  2. Speech: Dysarthria 3. Face: Facial droop on right side.  Investigation:  Immediate CT/MRI scan is suggested to confirm the diagnosis of stroke and rule out hemorrhage. Fasting lipid profile  blood glucose levels  and cardiac echocardiography will be required to assess the other potential risk factors.   Plan: 1. Immediate hospitalization and stroke care unit for thrombolytic therapy  if eligibility criteria are met. 2. Rehabilitation plan after stroke recovery. 3. Strict control of blood glucose and blood pressure levels. 4. Regular follow-ups with neurologist  diabetologist  and cardiologist. 5. Lifestyle modification counseling: healthy diet  regular physical exercise regimen.  Prognosis:  Depends on extent of brain damage  early intervention  and consistency in disease management.
Stroke,6,10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of an acute stroke.   Presenting Complaint: The patient complains of sudden onset of left-sided facial drooping  weakness  and numbness in the left upper and lower extremity that started approximately 25 minutes ago. He also notes difficulty in speaking  and his words are slurred.  Demographics: The patient is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife. He has no history of alcohol or drug abuse. He has a 30-pack year smoking history and is currently still smoking about a pack a day.   Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension for the past seven years  for which he is on Lisinopril 10mg daily  but he notes frequent non-compliance due to forgetfulness. Medical records also documented Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with Metformin 500mg BID.   Family History:  His father died at the age of 70 due to a stroke  and his mother died at the age of 78 from complications related to diabetes.  Clinical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient was found to be conscious but with evidence of expressive aphasia. He exhibited left facial droop and has significant weakness and decreased sense of touch in his left arm and leg.  This patient case presentation is consistent with findings in literature that suggest that stroke risk is higher among individuals with a history of hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and familial history of stroke. African American males are found to have a higher risk of stroke  particularly at the sixth decade of life  and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment predisposes an individual to stroke. This patient is a typical representation of demographic and clinical characteristics for stroke patients.

These symptoms began while he was watching television. His wife noticed these symptoms and called emergency services.  Past Medical History: - Chronic Hypertension: Diagnosed 12 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril 20mg/daily). Blood pressure control has been inconsistent.  - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 10 years ago and has been on statin therapy (Atorvastatin 20mg/daily).  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 7 years ago  managed with Metformin 1000mg twice a day. Recent HbA1c levels indicate poor blood sugar control.  - Overweight: His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 29. - Smoking: 1 pack a day for the past 40 years  recently quit a year ago. - Has a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables. - Family history of cardiovascular diseases: Father had a stroke at the age of 72.  Current Medication: - Lisinopril 20mg/daily - Atorvastatin 20mg/daily - Metformin 1000mg twice/day  Allergies: None reported.  Review of Systems: Physical Examination indicates slight confusion  right-sided facial droop  slurred speech  and decreased power in the right upper and lower limbs.  Based on the demographic data  it has been noted that stroke is more common in males and in individuals over the age of 65. Additionally  John's racial background (Caucasian)  socioeconomic status (middle class)  and location (urban Northeast) align with common stroke demographics. His risk factors include a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes  and smoking. These are all established risk factors for a stroke  and his symptoms along with physical examination findings signify a high suspicion for stroke.
Stroke,6,13,Patient Profile:   Name: John Doe  Gender: Male  Age: 69 years  Race: African American  Geographic Location: Urban setting  Eastern U.S.  Demographic Characteristics:  According to the American Heart Association's 2018 statistics  the risk of stroke is higher in individuals who are older  male  and of African American ethnicity like Mr. Doe.   Past Medical History:  John has a significant medical history of hypertension  which he has managed with medication for the past ten years. He also has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for five years ago  controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. His last HBA1c reading was about 7.0% which is slightly above the normal range. He has also been a cigarette smoker for the past 30 years and has moderate alcohol consumption.   This past medical history  including hypertension  diabetes  cigarette smoking  and alcohol use  increases John's risk of stroke considerably.  Presentation:  John was rushed to the hospital following sudden onset of difficulty speaking  weakness on his right body side  and difficulty understanding speech. He also complained about a severe headache prior to the above symptoms.  This presentation is pretty typical for stroke  particularly the acute onset of language and sensory disturbances  coupled with the severe headache.   Family History:  His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father had a stroke at the age of 75 and his mother died of a heart attack at the age of 68.  Family history is another risk factor that adds to John's risk of having a stroke.   Summary: Considering the given symptoms  past medical history  demographics  and family history  Mr. John Doe has high chances of having a stroke. The specific risk factors are advanced age  male sex  African American ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes  cigarette smoking  alcohol consumption  and a family history of cardiovascular disease.

Lisinopril 20mg once daily for hypertension. 2. Metformin 1000mg twice daily for diabetes control.  Summary: Considering the presented symptoms (sudden numbness on one side of the body  difficulty in speech comprehension  severe headache) and pertinent medical history (hypertension and diabetes)  Noelle's information fits the profile of a typical stroke patient. Her age group  gender  and comorbid conditions further place her at an increased risk of stroke relative to the general population. Immediate stroke evaluation and intervention are necessary.
Stroke,6,17,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Gender: Male  2. Age: 68 years old 3. Ethnicity: African-American 4. Occupation: Retired federal government employee 5. Residential region: Urban area  East Coast  U.S.A.  Presenting Complaint: 6. The patient has come with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness  slurred speech  and confusion which started about 3 hours ago.  Relevant Medical History: 7. Hypertension: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. He has been fairly compliant with antihypertensive medications. 8. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 8 years ago. The diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. 9. Hyperlipidemia: It was diagnosed two years back during a regular checkup. He has been on lipid-lowering agents since then. 10. Smoking history: The patient has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years. He quit smoking 5 years ago. 11. Alcohol: The patient has been a social drinker  consuming alcohol only on special occasions. 12. Obesity: The patient has been clinically obese  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 for the past 10 years. 13. Previous Stroke: The patient had a minor stroke 4 years ago with full recovery following treatment. 14. Family History: His father had a stroke at age 72.  Inference:   According to the demographic representation explored in the literature  the patient fits into the high-risk profile for a stroke. This is identifiable from his age  gender  ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes  previous stroke  regular smoking history  obesity  and family history of stroke. The onset of left-sided weakness  slurred speech (dysarthria)  and confusion signify possible cerebral infarction (Ischemic Stroke). Timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy (if deemed suitable and within the window period) promises a better prognosis. An immediate referral to a stroke specialist or a hospital offering acute stroke care is warranted.

Sudden weakness on the right side of the body including face  arm  and leg 3. Difficulty speaking and comprehending speech 4. Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes 5. Loss of balance and coordination  This problem representation is relevant since the patient is a typical high-risk group for stroke  as older age  male sex  Caucasian race  hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  ischemic heart disease  previous TIA  and family history of stroke are all significant risk factors. The presenting symptoms are consistent with a probable acute stroke. His lifestyle choices - smoking  alcohol  sedentary lifestyle and non-compliance with medication add to his risk. This representation also reflects findings from the literature on stroke epidemiology  demographics  and risk factors.
Stroke,6,28,Patient Representation:   Problem: The patient presents with the acute onset of a right-sided weakness  significant difficulty in speaking  and drooping of the right side of the face  strongly suggestive of a stroke.   Demographic Information: The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male. He is a retired engineer  living with his wife in an urban environment. He has no history of travelling outside the country in recent times. He does not smoke but drinks alcohol occasionally  exclusively wine. He maintains a slightly overweight body mass index of 28.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both conditions being treated with medication for the past 15 years. He had an Myocardial Infarction (MI) 5 years ago. His diabetes remains poorly controlled  with elevated HbA1c levels noted during his last visit. He follows a high-fat diet and has been advised numerous times to adopt a healthier diet  but has been non-compliant. His father died of stroke at age 72 and his older sister currently suffers from hypertension.   Medications: The patient is currently taking: 1. Metoprolol (50mg daily) - For managing hypertension and preventative measure post-MI. 2. Lisinopril (20mg daily) - Further antihypertensive therapy. 3. Metformin (1000 mg twice daily) - For Type 2 Diabetes. 4. Baby aspirin as a preventive measure post-MI. 5. Simvastatin - To manage his high cholesterol levels.  Review of Systems: Patient has recently complained of intermittent headaches and occasional blurred vision. No prior neurological deficits or complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.   Physical examination on presentation: He is alert but demonstrates some difficulty with speech. His blood pressure is high at 180/95 mmHg. Examination showed a right-sided homonymous hemianopia  right-sided facial droop  and profound right-sided weakness in the upper and lower limbs.  Investigations: Now undergoing a CT scan of the head to validate the clinical suspicion of stroke and to determine the type of stroke.   This patient’s demographics—age  race  known history of hypertension and diabetes  eating habits  family history  and recent complaints—all are contributing factors increasing the likelihood of a stroke. 
Stroke,6,29,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Demographic Information: The patient is a 71-year-old African-American male.  2. Presenting Problem: The patient presents a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech  which originated two hours ago.   3. Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and atrial fibrillation. He has been a smoker for 50 years but quit a decade ago.  4. Current Medications: The patient has been on Lisinopril  Metformin  Atorvastatin  and Warfarin.    5. Family History: The patient’s father had a stroke at the age of 60  his mother died of heart disease  and a sister is living with diabetes.  6. Social History: The patient is a retired truck driver  lives with his wife  and has three adult children.  Stroke is common among the elderly  particularly those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation. The risk is also exacerbated by smoking and a family history of stroke. Current medications indicate that the conditions have been managed  but a stroke can still occur due to inadequate control of these conditions or due to the patient's advanced age. Being African-American and male also put the patient at a higher risk of stroke according to the literature. Therefore  this patient's profile is consistent with typical stroke presentation.
Stroke,6,30,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson is a 69-year-old African American male.  Demographics: He lives in an urban area and recently retired from his job as a school principal. He is a widower  lives alone  and has three adult children.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with acute onset left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and facial droop which started about 90 minutes prior to arrival.   Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mr. Johnson has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) but is not on anticoagulant therapy due to a prior history of gastric ulcers. He is a former smoker quitting 15 years ago and consumes alcohol socially.   Family History: There is a family history of stroke; his mother had a stroke at the age of 75.  Current Medications: He is currently taking Metformin (500mg twice daily) and Lisinopril (10mg once daily).  Relevant Lab Results: Initial blood pressure on admission was 180/95 mmHg. Blood glucose levels are elevated. EKG confirms atrial fibrillation. CT brain done on arrival shows no evidence of hemorrhage.  Demographic Representation Explanation: This problem representation adheres to demographic statistics related to stroke. African American populations are known to experience higher rates of hypertension and prevalence of stroke in comparison to other race groups. The fact that the patient is also older (age above 60)  male  and with pre-existing health conditions (hypertension  diabetes  and AF) aligns with literature indicating these as significant risk factors of stroke. His lifestyle factors  such as former smoking and alcohol intake  also increase his vulnerability to stroke. The family history of stroke adds to his risk profile. In terms of geography  living in an urban area also is associated with higher stroke risk due to increased exposure to pollution and potentially unhealthy lifestyle.  The presentation of left-sided weakness  facial droop  and difficulty speaking is typical for a patient with ischemic stroke.
Stroke,6,31,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile: A 72-year-old African American male  non-smoker  and a resident of a suburban area  presents to the emergency department with acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speech that started a couple of hours ago.   Demographic Characterization: The patient's risk factor is increased due to the demographic representation of race  gender and being over the age of 65. Stroke risk is greater among African Americans and men. Moreover  age is also an important factor  as the stroke risk doubles for each decade after the age of 55.   Relevant Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  conditions that increase the risk of stroke significantly. In addition  there is also a history of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) 5 years ago. Past medical treatment includes optimum glucose control  antihypertensive drugs  and antiplatelet therapy following his transient ischemic attack. The patient has suboptimal adherence to his medications and struggles with maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to socio-economic factors.   Thus  the presence of uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  past history of TIA coupled with demographic factors  make this patient at high risk for stroke. Early recognition of symptoms  immediate medical attention and regular follow-ups can help in intensifying preventive strategies. Further management would include re-evaluation of antihypertensive treatment and tighter glucose control along with lifestyle intervention for healthy diet and physical activity.
Stroke,6,32,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Ms. Carey  a 68-year old African American female  has presented in the emergency department yesterday with symptoms of sudden confusion  trouble speaking  understanding and dizziness.  Problem: Suspected occurrence of stroke  Demographic Characteristics: Considering literature on stroke  Ms. Carey's race  age  and gender pose a risk. Stroke rates are twice as high for African Americans when compared to Caucasians. The rate is also higher for people above the age of 65 and the risk is slightly higher in females.  Risk Factors and Relevant Past Medical history: Ms. Carey confirms having a history of hypertension (chronic high blood pressure) and diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years. Both hypertension and diabetes are significant risk factors for stroke. She also reported being a heavy smoker until 10 years ago. She has suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years back  which also placed her in the high-risk category for stroke.  Relevant Social and Environmental Factors: Ms. Carey lives in an urban area with limited access to walkable spaces or healthy food options. This environment might have contributed to her hypertension and diabetes. After retiring as a school administrator  her social activity has reduced significantly  leading to a sedentary lifestyle.  Clinical Symptoms: Ms. Carey reported experiencing sudden confusion  severe headache with no known cause  trouble with seeing in one or both eyes  walking and balance issues  dizziness  and slurred speech.  Family history: Ms. Carey’s father suffered a stroke in his seventies. Stroke can run in families  so her family history constitutes another risk factor.  In summary  Ms. Carey’s demographic characteristics  along with her past medical history and environmental factors align with those commonly found in stroke patients. Primary concerns for Ms. Carey include her risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  previous TIA  and family history of stroke) along with the acute symptoms she presented with in the emergency department.
Stroke,6,33,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 68 years Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired construction worker Living status: Lives with his wife of 40 years Insurance status: Medicare  Presenting Problem:  John Doe reported to the hospital with sudden onset of left-sided body weakness and difficulty speaking that started approximately two hours ago. His wife noticed he was slurring his words and wasn't able to lift his left arm.  Family History:  His father had a stroke at the age of 65. His mother had hypertension and died of heart disease. His elder brother has diabetes.  Medical History:  John Doe has a 20-year history of hypertension  for which he has been taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. He has been a smoker for 50 years and has a 30-year history of heavy alcohol consumption. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and has been managing it with diet and Metformin. His latest HbA1C level checked six months ago was 7.2. He is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. His last cholesterol test revealed high LDL cholesterol levels for which he was prescribed Statins.  Lifestyle:  He is not physically active and is mostly sedentary. His daily routine includes watching TV and doing light household tasks. His diet mostly consists of high-fat and high-sugar foods.  Review of Symptoms: The patient complains of sudden weakness on the left side  difficulty speaking and understanding  trouble seeing in one or both eyes  headache with no known cause  and trouble walking.  Physical Exam:  Vital signs: BP- 170/95 mmHg  HR- 85bpm  irregular  RR- 16 breaths per min  Temp- 98.6 °F (37°C). General Appearance: Obese male appearing his stated age  looks distressed. Cardiovascular: Irregular rate and rhythm. No murmurs  rubs or gallops. Neurological: Left side facial droop  decreased motor strength (3/5) in the left upper and lower extremities  slurred speech  decreased sensation on the left side  normal strength on the right side.   This is a representation of a typical stroke patient  given demographic characteristics and risk factors. Age  ethnicity  family history  long-term untreated hypertension  smoking habit  diabetes  high cholesterol  are significant risk factors for stroke.
Stroke,6,34,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: The patient is around 69 years old  which is the average age of stroke onset as reported by the American Stroke Association. The patient identifies as African-American  as this population has a higher risk of stroke compared to Caucasians. The patient is male  and is retired  so he holds a lower socioeconomic status  which increases his stroke risk. He lives in a rural area  which means he has less access to immediate medical care.  Clinical Presentation: The patient presented to the ER with sudden-onset  severe headache  confusion  numbness on one side of the body  difficulty speaking  and vision problems in one eye. These represent typical signs of a stroke.  Medical History: The patient has a history of Stage II hypertension and has been on anti-hypertensive medication for the past ten years  making it a contributing factor to his stroke. He has a 30-pack year history of smoking  a major risk factor for stroke. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 5 years ago which has been poorly controlled. The patient also has a family history of stroke  his father suffered a stroke when he was in his early 70s.   Other Relevant Histories: The patient is also obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. This puts him at a higher risk of stroke due to potential hardening of the arteries and an increased likelihood of high blood pressure. His diet is high in saturated fats  salt  and cholesterol  which may contribute to the potential plaque buildup in his arteries. He has led a sedentary lifestyle since retiring  adding to the risk.  Druginformation: His medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and a low dose Aspirin regimen as preventive healthcare in cardiology.  Emergency Care: Upon arrival at the ER  a CT scan was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient was administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the appropriate 3-hour timeframe from the onset of his symptoms to optimally dissolve the stroke-causing clot and improve blood flow to the part of the brain being deprived.  Social History: The patient lives alone which takes into consideration that he may need home health services or rehabilitation after stroke recovery. Because of his low socioeconomic status  he may also require assistance from social services for managing his healthcare costs.

Demographics:  - Age: Elderly individuals are more susceptible to strokes  and the average age for males is 73 (African American men are at a higher risk compared to other ethnicities.). - Race: African American men have 1.4 times the risk of having a stroke compared to Caucasian men - Gender: Men have a higher risk of stroke than women  though more women die from strokes. - Living situation: Lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. His wife is able to monitor his health status and provide immediate help.  Medical History:  - Hypertension: John has a ten-year history of hypertension  which is a significant risk factor for strokes. - Dementia: Diagnosed with early-stage dementia two years ago.  - Diabetes: John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for strokes. - Prior stroke: John suffered a minor stroke four years ago  which makes him at higher risk for future strokes. - Smoking: John quit smoking ten years ago after his diabetes diagnosis  but his prior history of smoking is a risk factor. - Lemonade diet: John has long followed a lemonade diet  which given its high sugar content  could exacerbate his diabetes and hypertension  making him more susceptible to a stroke. - Medication: John has been regularly taking medication for his hypertension and diabetes.  Family History:  - Mother had stroke: John's mother had a stroke at age 75  indicating a potential genetic predisposition. - Brother has hypertension and diabetes: A brother with these conditions also contributes to John's risk.     Emergency departments would treat this presentation as a medical emergency  requiring immediate intervention and assessments to confirm a diagnosis and implement appropriate treatments.
Stroke,6,36,Problem Representation:  Patient Representation: A 62-year-old African-American male presents to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of a stroke.  Symptoms: The patient reports sudden onset of difficulty speaking (expressive dysphasia)  inability to move the right side of his body (right hemiparesis)  and problems with balance and coordination. He also acknowledges experiencing a sudden severe headache.  Demographics: Typical socio-demographic characteristics based on the prevalent literature are as follows. He is a retired factory worker with a high school education. He is a widower who lives alone  but he has adult children living nearby who visit him regularly. He has a history of light alcohol consumption  and he is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and Type 2 Diabetes for the past 8 years. He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on and off. He also has a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIA)  with the most recent episode occurring 6 months ago. There is no known history of heart disease or previous strokes.  Relevant Family History: The patient's father had a stroke at age 70  and his mother had hypertension and diabetes.  Relevant Social History: The patient reports a diet high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables. He mentions occasionally skipping meals due to lack of motivation to cook for himself. He also has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.  In this case  the patient's age  race  sex  personal medical history  family history  and lifestyle choices are indicative of a heightened risk for stroke. His uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  along with his history of TIA  are significant risk factors. His sedentary lifestyle  poor diet  and moderate-risk alcohol consumption further increase his risk.
Stroke,6,37,Patient Profile:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 72 years old - Gender: Male - Race: White - Occupation: Retired engineer - Live alone in a single-story house  Relevant demographics based on literature review:  According to studies  the majority of people who suffer strokes are over 60. Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over 65. The risk of having a stroke more than doubles each decade after the age of 55. Strokes can occur at any age including in children but they are more common as people age.  Men have a higher risk of stroke than women  however  more women than men die from strokes. White people are at a higher risk when compared to African Americans  though African Americans are more likely to die from a stroke. Retired and living alone could increase the risk due to decreased physical activity and social interaction.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago. Regularly takes antihypertensive medications. - Dyslipidemia: Prescribed statin therapy since 10 years ago. - Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 8 years ago. On oral hypoglycemic agents. - History of Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIA) 3 years ago  managed and followed-up. - Ex-smoker: Quit smoking 5 years ago. - Occasional Alcohol consumption. - No known drug allergies.  Relevant History:  The presence of multiple risk factors such as hypertension  dyslipidemia  diabetes  and history of TIA increase the chance of stroke. Furthermore  the patient being a former smoker and occasional alcohol consumer also escalates the risk for stroke. In addition  the patient's age and lone living status might contribute to delayed identification and treatment of stroke symptoms  as well as decreased physiologic reserves that complicate treatment and recovery.
Stroke,6,38,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 66-year-old African American male  retired  who lives with his wife. He used to work as a truck driver for over 30 years. He is a non-smoker but used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day until quitting ten years ago. He has a history of moderate alcohol consumption  indulging in 2-3 drinks per weekend. His father died of a stroke at age 70  and his mother has type 2 diabetes.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient initially presented with sudden weakness on the right side of his body  difficulty in speaking  and blurred vision  which occurred while he was watching television at home. His wife also reported that he seemed confused. These symptoms started approximately two hours ago.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide. Moreover  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and has been managing it with metformin. In addition  he has been taking atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia for the past three years. He also had a myocardial infarction eight years ago for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and takes aspirin for secondary prophylaxis.  Lifestyle:  The patient's diet is high in sodium and fats  with little to no regular exercise. He has been counseled multiple times about lifestyle modifications by his primary care provider but has had poor adherence.   Conclusion:  Given the acute onset of the neurological symptoms and the presence of key risk factors such as advanced age  African American race  hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  previous smoking  and family history of stroke  the likelihood of this patient experiencing an ischemic stroke is high. The lifestyle pattern  including diet and lack of exercise  amplifies these risks. High-priority considerations should be given to acute stroke protocols  including neurological evaluation  imaging studies  and potentially thrombolytic treatment  if appropriate  given the timeline of symptom onset.
Stroke,6,39,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Brown is a 72-year-old African-American male  living in the urban area of Detroit  Michigan. He is a retired engineer and has been on Medicare for the past several years. He is a widower and lives alone. His eldest daughter visits him few times a week.   Presenting Problem: Mr. Brown was brought into the emergency department by his daughter  who found him on the floor of his home. He was confused with slurred speech and right-sided weakness.   Patient Demographics: Mr. Brown belongs to a racial group that has a higher risk of stroke  as per data available in medical literature. He is also within the most common age group for stroke occurrences.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a history of hypertension and was prescribed antihypertensive medication  which he has been taking inconsistently due to forgetfulness and financial constraints. He also suffers from Type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. In the past  he was a heavy smoker but quit around 15 years back. He  however  continues to consume alcohol moderately. His diet is relatively high in saturated fats  as he often consumes fast food. He has a sedentary lifestyle and has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29  falling into the overweight category.   Family History: Mr. Brown's father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 67  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 78. He has a younger brother with hypertension and diabetes.  Movements and Mobility: Mr. Brown relies on a cane for mobilizing and requires support while maneuvering stairs. His motor skills have diminished over the past few years  and he has begun to have difficulty in carrying out his day-to-day tasks independently.  Mental State: He has a history of mild depression and takes anti-depressant medication. His daughter mentions that he has been more forgetful recently  often misplacing items and forgetting names or appointments. This could suggest the onset of cognitive impairment.  Social History: Mr. Brown lives alone and has a limited social network  making him at higher risk for social isolation. He neither drives nor uses public transportation  further restricting his mobility. His primary source of emotional support is his daughter who visits him frequently; however  she lives 30 minutes away from his residence.  This case represents a typical patient profile presenting with stroke. He has numerous risk factors  including age  race  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  prior smoking  inadequate physical activity  poor diet  overweight  alcohol consumption  family history of cardiovascular diseases  possible cognitive impairment  and social isolation.

Stroke,6,43,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  John Doe. He is currently retired and usually lives alone in a suburban area. Over the last decade  he has been undergoing treatment for several comorbidities  topping which is hypertension. Along with hypertension  his history also includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic atrial fibrillation. He smokes about a half-pack of cigarettes per day and has been a heavy drinker in the past  although he had reduced the intake in recent years. John has been compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication regimen but is less consistent with his anticoagulation regimen. His family history includes his father  who died of a heart attack at the age of 60  and a brother who had a stroke at age 75. He visited the emergency department today after experiencing sudden severe headache  confusion  and difficulty with speech and balance.  Reason for Presentation:  John Doe is presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of stroke  including sudden onset of severe headache  confusion and trouble with speaking and understanding speech  and balance. Given the combination of his age  gender  multiple comorbidities (hypertension  type 2 diabetes  atrial fibrillation)  a history of high-risk behaviours (smoking  alcohol consumption)  inconsistent anticoagulation therapy  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  he is at high risk for stroke.  This case is representative of typical demographic and clinical characteristics of stroke patients: advanced age  male sex  Caucasian ethnicity  multiple comorbidities (especially hypertension  atrial fibrillation and diabetes)  lifestyle risk factors (smoking  alcohol)  poor treatment adherence  comorbid conditions  and past family history related to stroke or heart conditions.
Stroke,6,44,Patient Profile: - Age: 72 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  - Smoking Status: Former smoker  - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate  - Physical Activity: Sedentary routine  Past Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  under medication - Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 7 years ago  under medication - Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed 5 years ago  under medication - History of transient ischemic attacks (TIA): Occured around 2 years ago  Current Presentation: The patient presented with sudden onset of unilateral weakness on the left side  difficulty speaking and understanding speech  and difficulty in maintaining balance. He reported a headache of increasing severity throughout the day and some blurred vision. The symptoms have been present for around two hours. Physical examination revealed left-sided facial droop and slurred speech.  According to the literature  this age group and race are prominent risk factors for stroke. Men have a higher risk of stroke in their earlier years compared to women  and Caucasians are at a higher risk of stroke compared to other races. Furthermore  the literature suggests that the patient's current symptoms and past medical history of hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  and transient ischemic attacks also strongly indicate the probability of a stroke.
Stroke,6,45,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   A 73-year-old African American male patient who is non-Hispanic  currently living in an urban setting with a socioeconomically disadvantaged status.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with sudden onset of weakness on the right side of the body  slurred speech  impaired vision in one eye  and severe headache.

She was a former smoker but quit 20 years back  and she occasionally drinks wine during family gatherings. Amelia is vegetarian with a BMI of 27 and has been slowly losing weight unintentionally in the past few months. She gets physical infrequently. She has a history of hypertension from her mid-40’s  for which she is on a daily regimen of Lisinopril. She also has a history of high cholesterol and is treated with Simvastatin. She has not been diagnosed with diabetes or heart diseases.  Presenting Problem: Amelia presented with sudden onset of weakness on the right side of her body  difficulty speaking and a severe headache. Her daughter noticed her pronouncing words mistakenly  and her right arm seemed to be slightly dropping when Amelia tried to lift both her arms.  Relevant Past Medical History: -Amelia was diagnosed with hypertension around her mid 40’s. It is controlled well with the help of Lisinopril.  -She also has high cholesterol levels and is on Simvastatin to manage it.  -She is a former smoker but quit smoking 20 years back. -She has not been diagnosed with diabetes or heart diseases.   Note: African American women are more likely to have strokes and hypertension than Caucasian women. Also  the risk of stroke increases with age  particularly after age 65. Hence  Amelia's ethnicity and age put her in a high-risk group. Smoking and the history of hypertension and high cholesterol also contribute to her risk.  Signs & Symptoms of Presenting Problem: -Weakness on the right side of the body -Difficulty speaking and understanding speech -Severe headache -Slight drooping of right arm

Stroke,6,63,Problem Representation:  I. Demographic Information:    1. Age: 66 years old   2. Sex: Female   3. Ethnicity: African American   4. Social History: Lives alone  a retired teacher  active in local community  non-smoker  and occasional alcohol drinker  II. Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension: Patient has been diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago and maintains medication.  2. Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 years ago. She is on oral antidiabetic medication.  3. Atrial Fibrillation: Diagnosed 1 year ago. On medication for rate control and anticoagulation.   4. High Cholesterol: Patient has hyperlipidemia  for which she takes statins.   III. Presenting Concerns:  Patient arrived at the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech starting approximately 2 hours ago. The patient was unable to hold things with the right hand and experienced difficulty in walking.  According to American Heart Association  stroke is more likely to affect people if they're aged 55 or older  increasing in likelihood with age. It is more common in women than men and in African Americans than white people. Moreover  hypertension  diabetes  atriplation fibrillation  and high cholesterol are among the prevalent conditions in stroke patients. The detailed medical history is provided so as to accurately diagnose and develop an effective treatment plan for the case of suspected stroke.
Stroke,6,64,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 67-year-old Latina female.   Presenting Complaint: The patient complains of sudden onset of weakness in her right arm and leg  difficulty in speech  and visual disturbances.   Past Medical History: Patient has a 10-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia. There is no history of smoking or alcohol use.   Family History: Her mother had a stroke at age 72 and her father had coronary artery disease  diagnosed in his late 60s.   Demographics: According to literature  older individuals  particularly those aged above 65 years  have a higher predisposition to stroke. Males and females have similar overall stroke prevalence  however  at older ages  it's more common in women. Ethnic variations are well-documented  with Latina women having a higher lifetime stroke risk compared to non-Hispanic white women.   Relevant risk factors:  1. Age - the risk of stroke increases with age  and the patient falls into the high-risk range. 2. Ethnicity - Latinas have higher stroke risks compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. 3. Gender - While stroke risk is similar across genders at younger ages  women tend to have a higher risk at older ages  mainly due to longer life expectancy. 4. Hypertension - Hypertension is a major risk factor for both types of stroke  ischemic and hemorrhagic.  5. Diabetes - Diabetes is considered an independent risk factor for stroke. 6. Family history of cardiovascular disease - Her family history puts her at a higher predisposition of developing stroke. 7. Hyperlipidemia - High cholesterol can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis  which can lead to a stroke.  This patient representation aligns with typical stroke presentations and is comprehensive in terms of potential risk factors and triggers. It is essential to consider all these factors while evaluating the patient and planning the management strategy.
Stroke,6,65,Problem Representation:  Patient A is a 72-year-old Vietnamese American female who presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe headache  difficulty in speaking  right-sided facial droop  and weakness of the right arm and leg  with symptoms appearing less than one hour ago.  Demographic Characterization: Patient A is a retired school teacher and a widow  living alone in her own home. She has three adult children that live nearby but they are not always available to assist her. She is non-smoker and she does not consume alcohol. As a first-generation immigrant  she has experienced significant language and cultural barriers in accessing healthcare. She has a relatively sedentary lifestyle and her diet is largely traditional Vietnamese cuisine with a high intake of salt and rice.  Past Medical History: Patient A has a history of hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus Type 2  and Hyperlipidemia  which were managed with oral anti-hypertensive  antidiabetic and statin respectively. Despite being on medication  her hypertension and diabetes have been poorly controlled due to noncompliance. She was previously advised to adopt lifestyle changes including dietary modification and physical activity by her primary care physician.   Relevant family history includes that her mother had stroke at the age of 75 and died at 76 due to heart attack. Her brother  aged 78  is currently living with post-stroke disabilities.   Considered together  this individual’s age  gender  ethnicity  socioeconomic status  lifestyle  medical history  and family history are consistent with the fact that older adults  particularly Asians and those with uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia are at an increased risk for strokes. Her familial history of stroke also places her at a higher risk. These factors highlight her vulnerability and need for immediate evaluation and stroke care.
Stroke,6,66,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Education: High school  Marital Status: Widowed  Employment: Retired  Residence: Lives alone in a single-story house  Clinical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed and managed with medication (Lisinopril 10 mg daily) for the past 15 years. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 8 years ago  managed with diet  exercise  and Metformin. 3. High cholesterol: Managed with Statins (Atorvastatin) for 10 years. 4. Smoking history: She quit smoking 5 years ago after a 30-year history (1 pack/day). 5. Alcohol: Occasional/social drinker.  Family history:   Her father had a stroke at the age of 72. Her mother had hypertension and her brother is living with type 2 diabetes.  Presentation:  Jane presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of slurred speech and right-sided weakness. Upon examination  her blood pressure was high (160/90 mmHg)  blood glucose was slightly elevated  and she had noticeable difficulty in speaking and moving the right side of her body.  Social Support:  Jane lives alone but has a supportive network that comprises her two adult children who live within 20 minutes from her and are willing to help with her care and recovery.  This problem representation highlights a typical high-risk stroke patient  considering the crucial risk factors. Stroke incidence increases with age  and the rates are higher for women aged 65 years and older. Hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  smoking history  and a family history of stroke represent significant risk factors. The social support network is also a factor that influences recovery and living conditions after stroke  which is significant for management and prognosis. Jane's demographic details and past medical history map very well with what is typically seen in stroke patients  as per literature.

The information is fictional and designed to represent a common case presentation.
Stroke,6,75,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Demographic Information: A 70-year-old African-American male.  Social History: Lives alone. Former smoker quit 10 years ago. Regular alcohol consumption. Sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. Poor dietary habits  high in fats and salts.  Occupation: Retired engineer.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 55  patient has inconsistent adherence to prescribed anti-hypertensive medication. 2. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diagnosed at age 60  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  patient's sugar levels show poor control. 3. High Cholesterol: High LDL and low HDL found during routine check-ups  patient on statin therapy with poor compliance to medication. 4. Family History: Father had stroke at age 75. Mother had a history of heart disease. 5. Previous TIA: Transient Ischemic Attack occurred 2 years ago.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought to the ER by his neighbor who found him lying on the floor. He is presenting with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  speech disturbance (slurred speech)  and facial droop on the right side  symptoms started about 3 hours ago.  Clinical Findings: Vital Signs: BP 160/90 mmHg  Pulse 80 bpm  Resp 18/min  Temp 98.6F  Neurological Examination: Conscious but confused. Right facial droop  slurred speech  power in right upper and lower limb 2/5  normal power in the left upper and lower limbs.   Diagnostic Test: Ordered a head CT scan to rule out hemorrhage and confirm ischemic stroke. Blood tests show elevated blood sugar and poor glycemic control.  This patient representation is reflective of the typical risk factors associated with stroke  which according to literature include age  African-American race  hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  smoking  alcohol use  sedentary lifestyle  family history of cardiovascular disease  and previous TIA. The demographic profile and clinical presentation is consistent with reported stroke cases.   The immediate care plan would involve administering thrombolytic therapy  considering the timing of symptom onset  and the continuous management of co-existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes  along with lifestyle modifications.
Stroke,6,76,Patient Profile:  - Name: Mrs. Margaret Jackson - Gender: Female - Age: 68 years - Race: African American - Marital status: Widow - Occupation: Retired teacher - Residence: Lives alone  has a caregiver who visits thrice a week - Education: Bachelor's Degree  Presenting Complaint:   Mrs. Jackson was brought to the emergency department by her neighbor after she complained of sudden weakness on her left side. She also noticed difficulty in speaking  slurred speech and lack of coordination.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: Diagnosed 20 years ago - Type II Diabetes: Diagnosed 10 years ago - High cholesterol: Diagnosed 5 years ago - Previous ischemic stroke: Happened 4 years ago  resulted in slight weakness in her right arm - Regular follow-up with a cardiologist for the past 5 years  Family History:  - Father passed away at the age of 72 due to a stroke - Mother with history of hypertension and diabetes passed away at the age of 77 due to heart disease - Older brother (70 years old) also has hypertension and Type II diabetes  Social History:  - Non-Smoker - Occasionally consumes alcohol (glass of wine during special occasions) - Limited Physical activity  Medications:  - Amlodipine 5mg once daily for hypertension - Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes - Simvastatin 10mg once daily at night for high cholesterol  This patient fits the profile of a typical stroke patient as per multiple studies which indicate that stroke incidence is higher among older adults  particularly those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The high cholesterol contributes to the risk of atherosclerosis and subsequently stroke. The fact that Mrs. Jackson is African American also places her at higher risk due to observed racial health disparities. Her previous ischemic stroke significantly increases her chances of having another stroke. The family history of stroke and heart disease also raises her risk.

Stroke,6,77,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  1. Demographics:  A 70-year-old African-American male. He is a retired school teacher  lives with his wife  and has three adult children. The patient's BMI is 28  indicating overweight. He has a history of high blood pressure and Type 2 Diabetes for the past ten years.  2. Medical History: He has poorly controlled hypertension and has been on medication (Lisinopril) for the last ten years with poor adherence. His blood pressure readings are usually around 150/90 mmHg. The patient also has Type 2 Diabetes with HbA1c readings consistently over 7% and has been prescribed Metformin.   3. Habits:  The patient has a 30-year history of smoking  reports drinking alcohol socially  and has a sedentary lifestyle. He also reports poor dietary habits  with a preference for high salt and high sugar foods.  4. Family History: There is a significant family history of stroke and heart disease - both his father and grandfather died of stroke complications in their 70s. His eldest brother had a heart attack at age 65.  5. Current Clinical:  The patient presents with sudden onset of weakness on the left side of the body  difficulty speaking  and loss of balance. These symptoms started approximately an hour ago.  This problem representation is built based on demographic and health disparities identified in literature  including older age  male gender  and African ancestry as risk factors for stroke  as well as comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. The lifestyle factors  like smoking  poor dietary habits  and lack of physical activity  are also known to increase stroke risk. The family history of stroke and heart disease indicates a possible genetic predisposition to these conditions.
Stroke,6,78,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson is a 68-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty finding words  which started approximately three hours ago.  Relevant Past Medical History:  As mentioned  he is a known case of hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled on Lisinopril  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past six years  managed by metformin. He does not follow a strict diet but informs that he takes his medications regularly. He also has a history of smoking 1 pack/day for 35 years but quit 5 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  He is a retired school teacher living with his wife and is usually physically active  managing daily routine work without any assistance. He doesn't consume alcohol.  Family History:  His father died due to a heart attack at the age of 75 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70.  Physical Examination: Mr. Johnson has a regular pulse  blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg and respiratory rate of 18/minute. Neurological examination reveals he has right hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) with an NIH stroke scale of 6.  Impression:  Given Mr. Johnson's presenting symptoms of sudden onset of right-sided weakness  dysarthria (difficulty articulating words)  his risk factors of being hypertensive  a diabetic  and a past smoker  along with his frail age factor and family history  he is highly suspected of having an acute ischemic stroke. Further examination and imaging are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause and extent of the stroke.
Stroke,6,79,Patient Profile:  Name: George Robinson  Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupity: Retired Religion: Christian Marital Status: Married Living Status: Living with spouse  Presenting Problem: Mr. Robinson was brought to the emergency room by his wife after he started slurring his speech and felt weakness in the right side of his body.  Medical History: 1) Hypertension: He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on medication since then. He's been advised lifestyle modifications - dietary changes  regular exercise  moderated alcohol consumption  and cessation of smoking; however  he has had inconsistent follow up and also struggles managing with lifestyle changes. 2) Diabetes mellitus type II: He has been managing this for the last 8 years with oral hypoglycemic drugs. His blood sugar levels fluctuate  suggesting variable compliance with medical treatment. 3) Smoker: He has a history of smoking 1 pack per day since he was in his early 20s. 4) History of TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack): He had a TIA 5 years ago but made a complete recovery. 5) Hyperlipidaemia: Mr. Robinson has been dealing with high cholesterol levels for 15 years and was prescribed statins but his compliance has been poor.   Affirmative Risk Elements: 1) Age: George is a 68 years old male  which places him within the high risk category for stroke. 2) Race: As a Caucasian  his risk for stroke is lower compared to African-Americans  but higher in comparison with Asian and Hispanic populations. 3) Gender: As a male  his lifetime risk of stroke is higher than women in the same age group. 4) Hypertension: This is the major modifiable risk factor for stroke.  5) Diabetes: This disease amplifies stroke development. 6) Smoking: Smoking  as a consistent risk factor  impacts stroke incidence in a substantial manner. 7) Prior TIA: Having had a TIA proves that he was already at an elevated risk for stroke.  8) Hypercholesterolemia: Elevated levels of cholesterol  particularly LDL  in combination with other risk factors increases the risk of stroke.  Social History: George is a retired engineer  married with 2 adult children living independently. He did heavy manual work his entire life. He has a 40 pack year history of smoking  he doesn't exercise regularly  and his diet is high in salt and fats. His spouse and children are actively involved in his medical care.   Family history:  His father died of a heart attack at age 70  and his mother is 90 with dementia. His elder sister had a stroke at 72. No other notable medical history in the familial line.   Medications:  1) Antihypertensive medication 2) Oral hypoglycemics 3) Statins  The goal now is to manage his acute stroke and then work on modifying his risk factors  concentrating on the elements that are actually modifiable such as his hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and lifestyle habits (smoking  diet  and lack of physical activity). Also  the family needs to be educated on the warning signs of stroke and the need for prompt treatment.
Stroke,6,80,Problem Representation:  Patient's Profile: The patient  Mr. John  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a primary residence in an urban area. He has retired from his career as an accountant and now lives with his wife.   Presenting Complaint:  He presents with sudden onset left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and visual impairment. This stroke symptom onset occurred around four hours prior to presentation.   Past Medical History:  John was previously diagnosed with high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia  both of which he manages with medications (Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily for his cholesterol). He has a history of episodic atrial fibrillation  for which he takes Warfarin. Additionally  he has a history of cigarette smoking  alcohol intake  and type II diabetes managed with Metformin. John admits he does not regularly exercise and his diet is high in carbohydrates and fats.   Family History:  His family history indicates his father had a stroke at the age of 75.  Social History:  As previously stated  John is a retired Accountant who has been married for 45 years and has three adult children and four grandchildren. He consumes alcoholic beverages moderately and has a 50 pack-year history of smoking  although he quit ten years ago. John reports adherence to his prescribed medication regimen.  This problem representation is in line with demographic representation. Literature indicates that advanced age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  atrial fibrillation  smoking  alcohol consumption  diabetes  lack of physical activity  and an unhealthy diet are all common risk factors for stroke. A family history of stroke also increases the risk. Males and individuals of Caucasian descent also have a slightly higher risk of stroke. However  stroke can affect people across all demographics.
Stroke,6,81,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: A 65-year-old Caucasian Male.  Acute presentation: Presenting with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and facial drooping lasting for an hour. He additionally reports slurred speech along with sudden severe headache with no known cause.  Past Medical history: 1. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with chronic hypertension for the past ten years. Controlled usually on medications - Thiazide and ACE inhibitors  with occasional bounces in blood pressure.  2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Diagnosed 8 years ago and managed with Metformin and regular exercise  and modified diet.  3. Hyperlipidemia: Managed with Statins.     4. History of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) two years ago  which recovered completely without any treatment.  5. Chronic smoker: He reports a smoking history of 20 pack years.  6. Family history: Positive for Cardiovascular Disease. His father died from a heart attack at the age of 50.  Social history: Lives alone  retired  has limited support system due to single child living out of state.  Review of Systems: Negative  except as mentioned above.  Examination: Alert and oriented. Blood pressure 170/90 mm Hg. Heart rhythm irregular. Weakness in right arm and leg  mild motor aphasia  Face appears asymmetric with drooping of the right side. Remaining examination unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: Given the sudden onset of focal neurological symptoms  a clinical diagnosis of stroke is suspected. Further investigations like CT or MRI of Brain  blood tests are planned. The patient’s hypertension  diabetes  and past history of TIA are significant risk factors which contributed to the present acute event.   This representation provides a comprehensive view of the patient  his acute event  along with significant demographic and past medical history information. The information aligns with the evidence from the literature that typical patients with stroke are often older  male  with comorbid conditions like hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia and history of smoking.
Stroke,6,82,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: African American female  age 72 residing in urban neighborhood.  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of left sided weakness  articulation difficulties and severe headache since the morning.  Medical History: Hypertensive and diabetic for the last 12 years. She has been on oral medications including Metformin and Lisinopril. She reports adhering to the prescribed medication routine and diet controls. Her last HbA1c and  blood pressure measurements (three months ago) indicated moderate control over both her chronic conditions.   Family History: Her father suffered a stroke in his late sixties and her elder sister had a transient ischemic attack at the age of 65. There are also instances of early coronary artery disease with her brother having had bypass surgery in his late fifties.  Social History: She is a retired school teacher  has never smoked  and denies alcohol use. She lives with her daughter and son-in-law.  Current Episode: She woke up this morning with sudden weakness in her left arm and leg  and she is unable to enunciate words clearly. She experienced a severe headache  however denies loss of consciousness  blurry vision  or vertigo. Her symptoms are consistent with stroke.  Note: This representation of stroke patient is to provide a realistic idea of how a typical patient with stroke might present in a clinical setting. It is based on the typical traits found in literature - higher propensity in people above 70  slightly higher prevalence in females and higher risks among African Americans. The patient's history of hypertension  diabetes  and family history of cerebrovascular disease also contribute to the elevated risk of stroke.
Stroke,6,83,Problem Representation  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old African American male is presenting at the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  symptoms that started 1 hour ago.  Demographic Characterization: The patient lives in an urban neighborhood. He is a retired teacher and lives with his wife of 40 years. They have 3 grown children who live within the same city. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. He just turned 68 this month. He follows a regular diet limiting salt and fat intake  however  admits that he doesn't engage in regular physical activity due to chronic back pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known case of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with medication. His hypertension was diagnosed 15 years ago and diabetes 7 years back. He is compliant with his medication for these conditions: Metformin 1000mg twice daily for diabetes and Losartan 50mg once daily for hypertension.  Family History: His father had a coronary artery disease and expired from a myocardial infarction at age 70. His mother  who is still alive at age 91  has a history of hypertension. His younger brother had a stroke at age 62.  Clinical Presentation: The patient states that while watching television  he suddenly developed right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. His wife brought him to the hospital immediately fearing that he might be having a stroke. His vital signs on arrival were stable  blood pressure was elevated at 165/95 mmHg. His speech was slurred and there was noticeable weakness and numbness on the right side of his body  more pronounced in his arm than his leg. He was confused and had difficulty understanding questions.  This demographic representation is based on established risk factors for stroke from literature  particularly for African American men in the age group of 60-75 years. The patient has ongoing chronic diseases like hypertension and type 2 diabetes and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease and stroke  further elevating his stroke risk.
Stroke,6,84,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African American female presented with sudden onset right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The patient lives alone  and she was found by her neighbor.  Demographics: African American women are disproportionally affected by stroke  making her at a potentially higher risk. Living alone also increases her risk due to potential delays in symptom recognition and access to medical care.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is a former smoker  quitting approximately 15 years ago. She also has hyperlipidemia and is currently under the treatment of a statin medication. The patient has a family history of stroke  with her mother suffering a stroke at the age of 65. Her compliance with the anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications can be irregular at times due to perceived side effects.  Referenced Demographics: According to the American Heart Association  stroke mortality is higher among African Americans  possibly due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore  women are more likely to die from a stroke than men  and the risk of stroke increases significantly after the age of 55  further amplifying the patient’s risk profile.   Risk Factors: The patient's hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  previous nicotine addiction  and family history of stroke are considerable risk factors for developing a stroke. Inadequate medication compliance also contributes to poor control of these risk factors.  Current Presentation: The sudden onset of unilateral weakness and difficulty speaking are classic symptoms of stroke  often caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain. The patient’s current presentation and past medical history highly suggest a stroke. Immediate medical attention is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment to minimize potential brain damage.
Stroke,6,85,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: - Age: 71 years - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired construction worker   Presenting Problem: The patient presents with sudden onset of severe headache  slurred speech  weakness on left side of the body  confusion  and disturbances in vision.  Background Information: The patient has a significant past medical history.   - Hypertension: He has been suffering from hypertension for over 15 years. According to patient records  blood pressure control has been primarily suboptimal.   - Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago. Patient's blood glucose levels have been inconsistently controlled.  - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed five years ago.  - Smoking: The patient has a 50-pack-year history of smoking  but quit 2 years ago.   - Alcohol: Regular alcohol intake  approximately 2-3 times a week.  - Obesity: Body mass index (BMI) of 32  classified as obese.  - Previous Stroke: The patient suffered a minor stroke about three years ago  with full recovery of functions.  Family History: He also has a family history of stroke  with his father having suffered a stroke in his late sixties.   Social History: The patient lives alone in a single-story house. He has no readiness or support for the functional decline that may be associated with stroke.  Review of Systems: Neurologic examination presents positive for hemiparesis  aphasia  and hemianopsia.  This patient's profile is reflective of the demographic representation of stroke patients in literature  which indicates higher stroke incidence among older  black individuals  particularly those with uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  prior strokes  and those who smoke or consume alcohol regularly. His social situation also taps into the context that older individuals living alone may have a worse prognosis after stroke.

This representation considers typical risk factors for stroke: age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity  family history of cardiovascular disease  smoking history  and a previous heart attack. Also  it takes into account the average age for stroke onset in males  which is 69  with whites being more susceptible than other ethnic groups."
Stroke,6,87,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint: Complaining of sudden onset of weakness in his right arm and leg  slurred speech  and difficulty seeing out of his right eye that started about an hour ago.   Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes controlled with medication for the last 15 years. He also has a history of dyslipidemia treated with a statin and occasional cigarette smoking (1/2 pack per day for the past 40 years). The patient admits to a somewhat sedentary lifestyle but regularly follows up his monthly appointments with his primary care physician. His blood pressure and blood sugar are reasonably controlled  but he sometimes forgets to take his medicine.  Family History: His mother had a stroke at the age of 75. His elder brother has coronary artery disease diagnosed when he was 60.  Social History:  The patient lives with his wife  retired from his job five years ago  and has a moderate socioeconomic status. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use.  Review of Systems: He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  abdominal pain  urinary incontinence  weight changes  fever  or chills.   Relevant lab findings:  Blood pressure - 155/90 mm Hg  random blood sugar  - 180 mg/dl  Total cholesterol - 185 mg/dl  LDL - 120 mg/dl  HDL - 35 mg/dl  Triglycerides - 250 mg/dl.   This patient's presentation  age  race  gender  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  family history  and lifestyle are consistent with a typical stroke patient as seen in the literature. The exact etiology of this stroke remains to be established by an imaging study  but given his history and clinical examination  this is likely an ischemic stroke.
Stroke,6,88,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 65 years Sex: Male Race: White  Patient History: John is a retired carpenter who started noticing signs of weakness in the left side of his body a couple of days ago. This was accompanied by severe headaches  dizziness  vision problems  and trouble walking.  Medical History: 1. Hypertension: John has been managing his high blood pressure with medication for over 15 years. 2. Diabetes: Patient is a Type II Diabetic and has been on medication for 10 years. 3. Smoke: Ex-smoker. He quit smoking 5 years ago  but had a 25-year history of heavy smoking before that. 4. Alcohol consumption: John drinks alcohol casually  around 2-3 times a week. 5. Dyslipidemia: Patient has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol levels  for which he has been taking statins for the past 5 years. 6. Family History: Mother deceased from ischemic stroke at the age of 72.  Presentation: At the time of presentation  John experienced sudden numbness and weakness in the left side of his body  severe headaches  trouble seeing with both eyes  difficulty walking and maintaining balance  slurred speech  and sudden onset of confusion. He was brought to the emergency department within three hours after the onset of symptoms.  This presentation resonates with existing literature data on stroke patient demographics and medical history. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention  men  especially those aged 60 and above  and persons with a family history of stroke have a higher propensity to develop strokes. Additionally  it is well documented that hypertension  diabetes  smoking  hyperlipidemia  and alcohol are risk factors for strokes. This case aligns with these statistics and represents a typical stroke patient profile and presentation.
Stroke,6,89,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 71 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher Location: California  USA  Chief Complaint: Presented with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech lasting for a few hours.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed five years ago  irregular in medication compliance. - History of high cholesterol  controlled through diet. - History of smoking - quit about 15 years ago. - Occasional alcohol consumption. - Last health check was six months back  blood pressure was found to be slightly elevated  but patient was asymptomatic.  Family History:  - Father died of stroke at the age of 78. - Mother died of heart disease at 76.  Diet and Exercise: - Reports eating a well-balanced diet  but struggles with maintaining a regular exercise regime due to osteoarthritis.  Psychosocial History:  - Widower living independently in his own home. Son visits weekly. - Enjoys reading  gardening  and watching television.  Disease Representation: - Stroke potentially secondary to unmanaged hypertension and history of high cholesterol. - Potential risk factors: advanced age  male gender  quit-smoking history  irregular in medication compliance  and family history of stroke. - Current complaint of sudden onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech  which are typical stroke symptoms.   The demographic representation  pathology  and medical history are based on research literature indicating that stroke incidences are higher in the elderly  in men  and in those with hypertension or high cholesterol. Patient's smoking history  lack of regular exercise due to osteoarthritis  and hereditary factors also contribute to the risk of stroke.
Stroke,6,90,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 69-year-old African-American male  retired truck driver  living with his spouse in an urban environment.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with ≤1 hour history of sudden  severe headache  accompanied by left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for which he has been prescribed medications (lisinopril 10mg once daily and metformin 1000mg twice daily  respectively). He also had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 5 years ago. His adherence to antihypertensive medications is not consistent.  Family History: His father died of stroke at the age of 72 and mother died of breast cancer at age 70.   Social History: The patient is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago after smoking 1 pack/day for 30 years. He consumes alcohol on rare occasions  just socially and never had drug abuse.  Lifestyle Risk Factors: The patient has a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in fat and salt. His BMI is 31  indicating obesity.  Review of Systems: Positive for episodes of sudden vision loss in last week and blurred vision. The patient also reports intermittent chest pain  dizziness  and occasional confusion.  The problem representation is typical for an individual suffering from a stroke. Risk factors include a history of hypertension  diabetes  TIA  as well as modifiable lifestyle risk factors such as obesity and high salt diet. The patient's demographic factors (age  ethnicity  diet  obesity  etc.)  past medical history (hypertension and diabetes)  lifestyle (sedentary  former smoker  rare alcohol use)  and family history (father's death from stroke) are representative of stroke patients as it conforms to epidemiological studies in literature.
Stroke,6,91,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  1. Demographic Information:     A 72-year-old  African-American Female  2. Socioeconomic Status:     Retired Teacher  Single Widow  living alone  relying on her pension.  3. Geographic Location:     Urban resident in New York  4. Past Medical History:     Hypertension for 10 years  currently under medication. Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 5 years ago and controlled through diet and medication. Moderately obese with a BMI of 31 and sedentary lifestyle. Ex-smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago. History of alcohol consumption  in moderation and occasional now.  5. Family History:     Mother had stroke at 75 years of age. Father died of heart disease. Older brother diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient was found unconscious by her cleaning lady. The cleaning lady noticed slurred speech and imbalance in the patient when she arrived. On discovery of the unconscious state  the 911 was called for emergency medical help.  Clinical Findings:  On arrival  she was lethargic and had right-sided hemiparesis and homonymous hemianopia. Her blood pressure was observed as 185/92 mm Hg and blood glucose level was 215 mg/dl.  Reason for Problem Representation:  Given the patient's age  race  medical and family history  she is at higher risk for stroke. Her uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  coupled with her obesity  further raises this risk. Her geographical location at a large populous city can also be a contributing factor given the higher air pollution  stress and other environmental factors. Her current condition of unconsciousness  along with right-sided weakness  visual disturbance and uncontrolled blood pressure  is indicative of a stroke event.  This representation can be useful for healthcare professionals in making quick decisions and prioritizing medical interventions for the patient. It is also useful in explaining the patient's situation to their relatives and understanding the risks associated with her condition.

Stroke,6,94,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 70-year-old African-American male presents to emergency department with sudden onset left-sided weakness  slurred speech  and facial droop.  Demographics:  The patient is a retired teacher who resides in an urban area and lives alone. He smokes a half pack of cigarettes every day and consumes alcohol moderately. He avoids regular exercise and has a diet high in salt and fat. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Past Medical history:  His medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been poorly controlled over the past few years. He has been taking antihypertensive and anti-diabetic medications irregularly. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years back  from which he made a full recovery. He doesn’t have any known allergies.  Demographic Information from Epidemiological Studies:  - Age: Stroke occurs in all age groups but is significantly higher in people who are aged 65 years or older. About two-thirds of strokes occur in individuals over the age of 65.    - Race: The risk of stroke is nearly twice as high for African-Americans than for Caucasians.  - Gender: Men have a higher risk of stroke than women  but more women die from stroke.  - Lifestyle: Individuals who smoke  have a poor diet  and lack physical exercise are at higher risk.  - Geography: Strokes are more common in the Southeastern states  often referred to as the """"stroke belt.""""  - Medical conditions: High blood pressure  high cholesterol  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease are all risk factors for stroke.  - Family history: Individuals with a family history of stroke or heart disease are at greater risk.    - Prior stroke or TIA: Having a previous stroke or TIA increases the likelihood of having another stroke.   In summary  the patient's age  race  lifestyle  geographical location  medical history and previous stroke/TIA all contribute to a high risk of a stroke. This information will be critical in planning his management and care."

Based on John's age  gender  prominent risk factors (hypertension  history of smoking  atrial fibrillation  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia)  family history  and the fact that he had a previous stroke  he is considered at high risk for stroke.
Stroke,6,98,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is Mr. Smith  a 73-year-old African American male who is presenting with acute neurological symptoms of a possible stroke. He is a retired government worker and lives with his wife in an urban environment.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith has been experiencing sudden onset of symptoms such as face drooping on the right side  difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  severe headache  blurred vision  and loss of balance and coordination for the past 2 hours.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a past medical history notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he is on medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). Despite his medications  his blood pressure has remained only moderately controlled. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and he is on Metformin for the same. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He is a teetotaler and there is no history of substance abuse. Furthermore  there is a family history of cardio-vascular disease; his father had a cardiac arrest at the age of 67 and his elder brother had a stroke at the age of 71.  Functional History: Prior to this episode  Mr. Smith was active and independent  able to manage his own daily routine and household chores with ease. His wife verifies that despite his medical conditions  his overall health had been stable prior to today’s event.  Lifestyle Factors: Mr. Smith reportedly does minimal physical activity  doesn’t adhere to a particular diet and tends to skip routine check-ups. He maintains a moderately high-stress lifestyle due to his job. He has regularly scheduled appointments with his primary care physician to manage his chronic conditions.   Risk Factors: Elderly age  African-American race  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  smoking  and the inherited risk of cardiovascular diseases are the significant risk factors in this patient's case referring to his probable stroke. These factors are also as per the demographic representation found in the literature regarding stroke patients.
Stroke,6,99,Patient Problem Representation:  Mr. Allen Foster  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking and facial droop. Mr. Foster  who is typically independent with a sedentary lifestyle  was found at home by his wife and immediately transported to the emergency department.  His past medical history is highly relevant and includes longstanding hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed with atenolol and atorvastatin  respectively  for over 10 years. Still  his compliance has been inconsistent  confirmed by his persistently elevated blood pressure (BP= 165/90mmHg) and LDL cholesterol levels on routine clinic visits. Mr. Foster was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 5 years ago; however  struggles with diet management have resulted in less than optimal glycemic control (latest HbA1c 8.5%).  Moreover  his 50-pack year smoking history (albeit with attempts to quit in the past) coupled with a moderate alcohol consumption  significantly heightens his overall risk profile. His father also suffered a stroke in his early 70s.   Mr. Foster’s social history reveals that he is a retired banker  living in a suburban home with his wife. He confided about his increasing struggle with stress  coupled with a decline in physical activity since his retirement which has resulted in weight gain (BMI 29).   In light of these details  a comprehensive evaluation to confirm a potential stroke and assess its severity is urgently needed. Mr. Foster's multiple vascular and lifestyle risk factors suggest that he has a high likelihood of having suffered a stroke  necessitating immediate investigation and intervention.

His right face droops  and John demonstrates a right-side visual field cut.  Neurological Exam:   - Glasgow Coma Scale: 14/15 (He lost one point for the verbal response due to his difficulty speaking) - Right sided hemiparesis and mild dysarthria. - Right-side homonymous hemianopsia.  CT Scan:  An urgent CT scan of his head revealed an ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory.  The patient represents the typical clinical presentation of an acute ischemic stroke. All key risk factors associated with stroke are present: advanced age  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidaemia  previous smoking history  and family history of stroke. His presentation and investigation results confirm a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. Key problems identified are the need to manage the acute stroke and to optimize secondary prevention measures.
Stroke,7,1,Case Report  Patient Information: Mr. X is a 69-year-old Caucasian man  who has been living an active and independent life in a suburban area in the Rocky Mountain Region. His socioeconomic status is middle class with retirement savings. He is a retired mechanical engineer. Mr. X has been a non-smoker and non-drinker for the past 10 years. Though he lived for 30 years in mutual companionship with his partner  he is presently a widower with two grown-up sons living out of state.  Clinical Presentation and History: Mr. X was brought to the emergency room by ambulance. He reported sudden onset of slurred speech  right-sided weakness  and difficulty understanding speech approximately 2 hours prior to admission. He also complained of dizziness. He was generally in good health until these symptoms started. His past medical records reveal controlled hypertension for the past seven years and managed type 2 diabetes for the last five years. He was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation a year ago and has been stable on prescribed oral anticoagulants. There is a familial history of stroke in the patient’s father and elder brother.   Physical & Neurological Examination: On physical examination  Mr. X was conscious but clearly had difficulty articulating words and was unable to repeat sentences. He could comprehend language but was unable to assimilate his thoughts into words. His vitals were stable and had no signs of cardiac distress.   The neurological examination showed right-sided hemiparesis with a grade of 2/5 on the muscle strength scale and hypoesthesia in the right arm and leg. Right-sided facial droop was also identified. His right upper and lower extremity reflexes were depressed. No cerebellar signs were observed.   Hospital Course of Treatment: After Immediate CT scan ruled out hemorrhage  the patient was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke  potentially due to atrial fibrillation based on his past medical history and the clinical scenario. As he was within the therapeutic window for thrombolysis  he was treated with intravenous rtPA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator)  after which he was admitted to the Stroke Unit for further management and observation.  Mr. X showed progressive improvement over the following days. On the third day of admission  a CT angiography of his head and neck was performed  which discovered moderate stenosis in the left middle cerebral artery - likely the source of his initial stroke.   The patient was started on aspirin  statin therapy  physical and speech therapy as part of his recovery plan.  Outcome and Follow-up: After a week when Mr. X showed significant improvement in his neurological symptoms and was able to move his right extremities against gravity  he was discharged with follow-up appointments scheduled in neurology  cardiology  diabetes  and hypertension clinics. His sons came in to assist with his discharge procedure and home-based care.  Mr. X's case underscores the importance of time-sensitive stroke management  the role of thrombolytics in eligible patients  and the critical value of systematically following the Stroke Pathway for patient care.  This case report will be archived in the stroke register for future reference and teaching purposes. We will also conduct a follow-up after some months to better understand the effectiveness of post-stroke care in Mr. X's case.
Stroke,7,2,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Hypertensive and Diabetic Patient  Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male. He lives in an urban area and is a retired school teacher. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 32  which classifies him as obese. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol consumption. His socioeconomic status is middle class.   Past Medical History: The patient has had a history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus for 18 years and Hypertension for 20 years. Family history includes a mother with stroke and a father with heart disease. His medication history includes Metformin for diabetes  Losartan for hypertension  and a daily aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention. He has no allergies to medication.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started approximately three hours prior.  Clinical Examination Findings: Upon examination  the patient appeared conscious but anxious. Vital signs upon presentation were: blood pressure 172/98 mmHg  pulse 88 bpm  and respiratory rate 18 per minute. His fasting blood sugar was 240 mg/dL  and Hemoglobin A1C was 8.5%. On neurological examination  he demonstrated facial droop on the left side  slurred speech  and left-sided hemiparesis.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An urgent CT head scan was performed which showed an area of low attenuation in the right middle cerebral artery distribution  indicating recent ischemic stroke. Other laboratory findings showed elevated LDL cholesterol levels at 160 mg/dl (normal range: <130 mg/dl) and elevated serum creatinine levels at 1.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dl)  indicating renal insufficiency.   Management and Outcome: The patient was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. As less than 4.5 hours had passed since the onset of symptoms  he was a candidate for thrombolysis and intravenous Alteplase was administered. Stroke neurology  nephrology  and endocrinology were consulted. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed with medication adjustments. He was started on a statin for the high cholesterol levels. Speech and physical therapy were initiated. After a hospital stay of two weeks  the patient showed gradual improvement  regaining some motor and speech functionality.  Discussion: This case represents a common scenario in the United States  where stroke remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia are well-established risk factors for stroke  as seen in this patient. This case underscores the importance of proactive management of risk factors for stroke in a demographic population that is shown to be more vulnerable to the disease. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are key in preventing life-threatening conditions like stroke from happening in the future. 
Stroke,7,3,Case Report: Stroke   Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic female  living in an urban area with her spouse. She is a retired school teacher.  Chief Complaint:  She visited the health care facility with complaints of sudden weakness on the right side of her body  slurred speech and difficulty walking that started two hours prior to hospital presentation.  History of Present Illness:  Her symptoms began suddenly while she was reading a book  completely unaware of any precipitating factors. The weakness made her unable to hold the book  and she found it challenging to speak to her spouse. There was no reported seizure or loss of consciousness  no headache  no visual changes  and no bladder or bowel incontinence.  Past Medical History:  She has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for 10 years  intermittently compliant with prescribed medications. She is an ex-smoker  having quit 15 years ago  and admits to alcohol consumption only on social occasions. No history of stroke or any known neurological conditions. No family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Physical Examination:  On presentation  the patient‘s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  pulse rate 78 beats/min  temperature 37.1°C  and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination were normal. Neurological evaluation showed a motor power of 2/5 on the right side of the body (face  arm  and leg)  slurred speech  and mild facial droop on the right side. Her gait was affected because of the weakness. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 13/15 (E4V4M5).  Diagnostic Assessment:  Lab investigations showed normal complete blood picture and renal function test. Her fasting blood glucose level was 165mg/dl  slightly above the target range.  A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head revealed a hypodense area in left hemisphere  which is indicative of an acute infarct region. Based on her clinical presentation and CT findings  a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was made.  Treatment and Management:  The patient was given intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) as she was within the therapeutic window period of 4.5 hours. Her hypertension and diabetes were managed with appropriate medications. She was referred for physiotherapy and speech therapy for her rehabilitation.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of timely identification and management of acute ischemic stroke. Despite her known history of hypertension and diabetes  the patient neglected the regular medical follow-ups  which likely contributed to the acute episode. Public health interventions to increase awareness regarding the importance of regular health check-ups  especially for individuals with chronic illnesses  could be beneficial.
Stroke,7,4,Title: A Case Report of Middle-aged Male with Embolic Left MCA Stroke   Patient Profile: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  an ex-smoker  and a moderate alcohol consumer  living in an urban setting. He has worked as a manager in a financial institution for nearly 30 years  leading a sedentary lifestyle with a lack of regular physical activity. He is overweight with a BMI of 28. His family history includes hypertension and stroke  with his father suffering a fatal stroke at the age of 70. The patient is currently separated from his wife and living alone.  Medical History: Among his comorbidities are Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  controlled with metformin  and hypertension  managed with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Both were diagnosed eight years ago. Hypercholesterolemia was also diagnosed five years ago and has been under control with statin therapy. He had been suffering from mild episodes of headache and dizziness particularly on sudden standing up for the past six months but had not brought it up with his physician.  Recent Illness: The patient presented at the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  aphasia  and visual neglect on the right side. The initial NIH Stroke Scale score was 17; Brain imaging demonstrated an acute infarct in the left MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) territory  confirmed as embolic in origin by subsequent investigations. Carotid Doppler tests were performed revealing a significant stenosis in the left internal carotid artery. His blood pressure was 160/92 mmHg  glucose was 238 mg/dl  while other labs were essentially within normal limits. ECG showed no arrhythmias  whereas echocardiography revealed no intracardiac thrombus or valvular abnormalities. He had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 (age  hypertension  diabetes).  Management: Given the onset of symptoms about 2 hours prior to arrival  the patient was treated with the recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA). Further  antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated after 24 hours of rtPA administration to prevent secondary stroke. Statin therapy was optimized to manage hyperlipidemia and he was encouraged to follow dietary advice and lifestyle modifications.  Outcome: With substantial improvement over the next few days  he was discharged with a referral to the stroke clinic and physiotherapy for motor rehabilitation. On follow-up  he reported significant improvements in his muscular weaknesses  aphasia  and visual neglect.
Stroke,7,5,Title: Acute Cerebral Ischemic Stroke in a 65-Year-Old Female Patient with Hypertension and a History of Smoking  Patient Demographic Information:   The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who lives in a suburban area. The patient is retired  previously working as a school teacher  and is living with her husband.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient's husband identified symptoms of sudden weakness and numbness in the right side of her body and slurred speech  subsequently immediately calling for emergency medical assistance.   Past Medical History:  The patient has chronic hypertension  controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). She has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit ten years prior to this incident. She has no known history of diabetes mellitus or heart disease. However  her father experienced a heart attack in his late 50s. She has no history of alcohol or other substance use. The patient has not undergone any surgeries in the past. She reports inadequate physical activity and admits to a diet high in sodium and fats.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  she was alert and oriented to time  place  and person but had difficulty speaking. She exhibited right-sided hemiparesis with a strength of 2/5 and a right facial droop. Her blood pressure was elevated (180/110 mmHg) with a regular pulse of 80 beats per minute. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A non-contrast CT scan of the head revealed an area of low attenuation in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)  indicative of an ischemic stroke. Blood test results revealed normal blood glucose  electrolytes  and complete blood count except for slightly raised total cholesterol (220 mg/dL). An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was outside the window of thrombolytic therapy  which is generally administered within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Nevertheless  the patient was started on aspirin (325 mg daily)  and hypertension was managed with labetalol to maintain systolic blood pressure under 180 mmHg.   The patient also received intensive physical and occupational therapy in the days following the acute incident to aid in the recovery of function. Smoking cessation counseling was reinforced  and she was referred to a registered dietitian for dietary modification.  Follow up and Outcomes:  The patient made a slow but progressive recovery. Her speech improved significantly  and motor strength in her right arm and leg had a gradual improvement over the course of several weeks of intensive rehabilitation. She is continuing physical therapy and occupational therapy in an outpatient setting. Her cholesterol level and blood pressure are being optimally controlled with medication and diet modifications.   Teaching Points:  This case exemplifies the known relationship between hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol diet  physical inactivity  and ischemic stroke. The importance of prevention  in this case  cannot be stately enough and should involve rigorous control of hypertension and cholesterol  regular exercise  a balanced diet  and no tobacco. This case also underscores the importance of recognizing the symptoms of stroke and of seeking immediate medical attention.
Stroke,7,6,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in an Elderly Patient with Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Case Description:  Patient Information: A 72-year-old African American male.  Chief complaint: The patient was brought to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden onset of weakness on the right side of the body and difficulty in speaking lasting for approximately three hours.  History of present illness: The patient was in his usual state of health until three hours before admission  while having dinner with family  he suddenly experienced an inability to lift his right hand and slurred speech without any complaint of headache or dizziness.  Past medical history: He had a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension. He is a non-smoker and denies any regular alcohol use. No family history of cerebrovascular disease.  Personal and family history: The patient was born and raised in Alabama. He worked as a primary school teacher and has been retired for the last eight years. Father died of a heart attack at the age of 76 and mother died of old age at 85.  Physical examination upon admission: On examination  his blood pressure was 162/98 mmHg  pulse 80 per minute  and respiratory rate 18 per minute. Neurologic examination revealed right facial palsy  motor aphasia  and right-sided hemiplegia. Initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14.  Laboratory examinations: A routine blood test showed high blood sugar level (13.3 mmol/L). Hemoglobin A1C was 7.6%  serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl  and LDL cholesterol was 130 mg/dl.  Imaging examinations: A CT scan of the brain done immediately on his arrival at the ER confirmed an acute left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke.  Final diagnosis: Patient was finally diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke.  Treatment: The patient was not a suitable candidate for intravenous thrombolysis due to the time of symptom onset more than 3 hours. He was started on aspirin  atorvastatin  and continued with his regular antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications.  Outcome and follow-up: The patient was transferred to the neurology ward for further management and rehabilitation. At the one-month follow-up visit  the patient showed moderate improvement in his neurological deficits (NIHSS score dropped to 9).  Lessons from the case: This case highlights the important role of effective long-term control of diabetes and hypertension  both of which are well-established risk factors for stroke. Public awareness on stroke symptoms to ensure timely intervention should also be emphasized.   Concluding Remarks: Stroke is a critical and often disabling event that requires immediate attention and care. This case underlines the necessity for prompt diagnosis and intervention  as well as effective management of comorbid conditions such as T2DM and hypertension  particularly in populations with higher susceptibility.

In terms of neurological history  he experienced an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory about six months ago. No past surgical history was reported.  Presenting Complaint/Case Presentation: The patient presented with persistent difficulty in walking and balancing  experiencing a tendency to 'drift' towards the left side. He also had difficulty in expressing himself in words. He has no problems with understanding  reading  or writing.  Assessment: On examination  his cognitive examination was intact with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 28/30. Language assessment showed fluent speech with paraphasic errors. The comprehension of verbal and written language was intact. The right lower facial droop was present. He had a positive Romberg's sign and sensory examination revealed mild impairment of proprioception. No other cranial nerve abnormalities were detected.  Imaging Findings: A CT scan of the head revealed encephalomalacia in the right MCA territory  in keeping with the previous history of stroke. No acute infarct or hemorrhage was seen.  Discussion: Mr. X's persistent difficulty in walking and left-sided 'drift' may represent a neurological condition known as 'pusher syndrome'. This is often observed after right hemisphere strokes and is characterized by postural imbalance  with a tendency to 'push' towards the paretic side  opposing corrective forces. His difficulty in spoken language can be attributed to 'expressive aphasia' secondary to his right MCA stroke.  Management and Follow-up: He was started on an aggressive multidimensional stroke rehabilitation program  including occupational  physical and speech therapy. Antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemic medications were optimized. He was advised to continue atorvastatin for secondary prevention of stroke. Regular follow-up  with a plan to reevaluate his clinical status in three months  was organized.  Informed Consent: Informed consent for the case report was obtained from the patient.

Stroke,7,8,"Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 68-year-old Female with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report  Introduction: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  with nearly 800 000 people experiencing a stroke each year. Manifestations include sudden unilateral numbness or weakness  confusion  difficulty speaking or understanding speech  visual disturbances  difficulty walking  and severe headaches.  Patient Information: This case involves a 68-year-old African-American woman  Mrs. X  who was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) following an acute episode of right-sided weakness  facial droop  and slurred speech. She is a resident of an urban neighborhood in New York City. She is retired and living with her husband.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she was afebrile with blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 80 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Neurologic examination revealed right facial droop  right-sided hemiparesis  and expressive aphasia.  Past Medical History: Her medical history was significant for hypertension for the past fifteen years  managed with lisinopril and amlodipine. Her family history was positive for stroke with both her father and elder brother having suffered strokes in their early seventies. She has been a non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. She has no known drug allergies.  Diagnostic Assessment: A non-contrast CT scan brain was immediately ordered  which displayed an area of early ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory. A subsequent MRI confirmed a left MCA territory infarct.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the patient’s presentation within the 4.5-hour window from onset of symptoms  she was administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) after obtaining informed consent. She was admitted to the stroke unit where her hypertension was managed with her usual antihypertensive drugs and she was placed on aspirin 325 mg per day.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: After intensive inpatient physical  occupational  and speech therapy  her strength improved  and her speech became clearer. At her two-month follow-up visit  she had only mild expressive aphasia and minimal right arm weakness.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of quick recognition and treatment of acute ischemic stroke  which has a direct impact on the prognosis of the patient  as demonstrated by the considerable improvement in our patient’s outcome. Regular management and control of risk factors such as hypertension can aid in the prevention of stroke and its devastating consequences.

Stroke,7,9,Patient Profile:   Mr. Smith  a 68 year old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department after being found unconscious at his home by his daughter. He is a retired salesman and a widower living alone in an urban area.   Chief Complaint:  The daughter reported that he had sudden difficulty in speaking and weakness on the right side of his body before he became unconscious.   History of Present Illness:  Upon further investigation  it was discovered that Mr. Smith had two similar episodes in the past three months. However  those persisted for only a few minutes and he recovered fully without any medical intervention. He brushed it off as episodes of severe exhaustion related to his age.  Past Medical History:  He is known to have hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for the last 10 years. His blood pressure and glucose levels are often elevated despite being on antihypertensive and oral hypoglycemic agents respectively. Additionally  he has a 40 pack year history of smoking and occasional alcohol intake. He is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. He had a myocardial infarction ten years back for which he underwent angioplasty and stenting. There is no known history of stroke in the family.   Physical Examination:  Mr. Smith was afebrile with a blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg  pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. He was unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. His right sided limbs were flaccid with a power of 0/5. The left sided limbs had normal power. Pupillary reaction was sluggish on the right side but normal on the left. Reflexes were diminished on the right side compared to the left. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations:  An emergent non-contrast CT brain showed a large area of hypodensity in the left middle cerebral artery territory. His Hemoglobin A1c was 8.0% with fasting plasma glucose of 160 mg/dL and a random plasma glucose of 240 mg/dL. His lipid profile showed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (150 mg/dL).  Impression:  Given his significant past medical history  physical findings  and CT brain findings  a diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made.  Management:  Mr. Smith was immediately initiated on intravenous thrombolytics within three hours of his stroke onset under strict monitoring in a stroke care unit. He was also started on dual antiplatelets  statin  and antihypertensive medications. His diabetes was managed with insulin. Part of his care plan included smoking cessation  dietary modification  and planned physiotherapy.  Discussion:  Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability. The risk factors in Mr. Smith's case – hypertension  diabetes mellitus  obesity  and smoking – are modifiable and can contribute to stroke incidence. It is vital to rigorously control these risk factors which could have perhaps averted or mitigated this unfortunate event in Mr. Smith’s life.

Stroke,7,13,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 64-year-old Caucasian Male with Hypertension and Type II Diabetes: A Case Report  I. Introduction  Presenting an interesting case report of a Caucasian male patient who  despite maintaining a healthy lifestyle  was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. A case-provoking detail is the patient's medical history of hypertension and Type II diabetes.  II. Patient Information  The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male  lives in a suburban neighborhood  married with two grown-up children  a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. He was retired  with a history of working as a mechanical engineer. His diet was mostly balanced with regular home-cooked meals. He has been on medication for hypertension and type II diabetes for roughly ten years.   III. Medical History  The patient's mother had a stroke in her 70s  suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to cardiovascular conditions. His elderly sister is living with Type II diabetes and hypertension  just like him. His cholesterol levels were fluctuating around the higher side of the average range  for which he had not taken any medication. There was no previous history of any cardiac condition  transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.  IV. Case Presentation  The patient was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. On admission  his blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  and blood glucose level was 230 mg/dl. A CT scan was promptly performed revealing an early left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. Echocardiography did not reveal any cardiac thrombi.  V. Treatment and Progress   The patient was initially managed with an IV administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Despite being outside of the window of direct thrombolysis  he was considered for mechanical thrombectomy. However  due to the rapid progression and extensive location of the infarct  this treatment was not pursued. He was shifted to the Stroke Unit where he was put on a combination therapy of aspirin and atorvastatin  along with strict glycemic control measures and antihypertensive agents.  After spending 12 days in the hospital  the patient was discharged with prescriptions for his medications and was enrolled in a rehabilitative program to manage his hemiparesis and aphasia. He was also advised to undergo regular follow-ups with a neurologist  a cardiologist  and an endocrinologist.  VI. Conclusion  This case study reveals the unpredictable nature of ischemic stroke in patients with a history of chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes  despite a relatively healthy lifestyle. It underscores the importance of regular health screenings and efficient control of underlying risk factors in such populations to avert fatal or debilitating events like a stroke.  VII. Patient Consent  A verbal and written consent was obtained from the patient to use his medical records for the treatment and for the purpose of this case study.
Stroke,7,14,Case Report  Patient Information:   Mr. J  an 85-year-old African American male  was admitted to our hospital for left-sided weakness and speech difficulty. He is a retired architect  living with his wife in an urban residence. His wife reported that he had been fit and well until a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 6 hours before admission. Mr. J is a non-smoker  with occasional alcohol consumption. There is no known drug abuse or occupational exposure to hazardous substances.  Past Medical History:   Mr. J had been diagnosed with hypertension in his early seventies and is currently on medication (Ramipril 10mg daily). He also has Type-II Diabetes  controlled with metformin (500mg) twice daily  diagnosed at the age of 75. He suffered from a Myocardial Infarction (MI) 3 years ago with subsequent placement of a drug-eluting stent which demands he takes daily aspirin (81mg) for antiplatelet therapy. His last routine health check-up had taken place a month ago  where his blood pressure and blood sugar levels were under control  and there was no significant change concerning his well-being.  Presenting Concerns:   On the day of admission  Mr. J experienced sudden onset of speech difficulty  followed by left-sided weakness. He showed no signs of confusion or altered consciousness. No previous episodes of transient ischemic attack were reported. There were no additional symptoms like headache  vertigo  vomiting  or seizures.  Clinical Findings:   On examination  Mr. J's vitals were stable. Neurologically  he was conscious and cooperative but showed signs of expressive aphasia. Left-sided hemiplegia was evident  along with left upper and lower limb weakness. His face was drooping on the left side. His GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) was E4V3M5  and the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 11  suggesting moderate stroke. His pupils were equally reactive  and there was no abnormality in the fundus examination.  Diagnostic Assessment:   Primary ECG and cardiac enzymes were normal  ruling out acute MI. Blood investigations  including complete blood count  electrolytes  and coagulation profile  were within normal limits. Blood sugar was slightly elevated  146 mg/dL. CT scan of the brain confirmed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory non-hemorrhagic infarct  confirming the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke.  Therapeutic Intervention:   As the window period for thrombolysis had passed by the time the patient was admitted to the hospital  he underwent conservative management. This included antiplatelet therapy  control of triggering factors such as hypertension and diabetes  as well as speech and physical therapy for left-sided weakness and speech disturbance.  Follow-up and Outcomes:   After 2 weeks  Mr. J demonstrated substantial improvement in his motor power and speech. He was referred for outpatient rehabilitation and is currently under regular follow-up with neurology  cardiology  and endocrinology. Patient adherence to prescribed medications and therapy has been outstanding  leading to optimistic prognosis.  Patient Perspective:   Mr. J expressed relief at the multi-disciplinary interventions provided by the hospital team. He is hopeful and motivated to comply with necessary treatment and rehab for overall recovery.

Stroke,7,15,Case Report: Ischemic Stroke in a 67-Year-Old African-American Female  Patient Information:  The patient is a 67-year-old African-American female  retired school teacher  non-smoker  and she's light alcohol consumer (two drinks per week). She has been residing in the urban area of New York since birth. She has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus which are being managed by medications. There is no history of similar disease in her family.   Clinical Findings:  The patient was brought to the emergency department with an acute onset of left-side weakness and slurred speech  which started approximately two hours ago while having lunch. She also reported experiencing a sudden severe headache. On physical examination  the patient appeared alert  but her speech was slurred. The left side of her face was drooping.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Investigations revealed a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg  blood glucose of 197mg/dl and a body mass index of 32.0. An immediate CT scan of the brain was performed  which depicted a low-density area in the right middle cerebral artery territory  indicative of acute infarction. High-density areas observed suggested possible hemorrhagic transformation. Fundoscopy revealed changes characteristic of diabetic retinopathy. No significant findings were observed in any of the remaining ancillary tests  including lipid profile and renal function test.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted to the stroke unit. Anti-hypertensive treatment was promptly adjusted to optimize blood pressure  and her glucose levels were intensively managed. She received intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within the 4.5-hour window period.   Follow-Up and Outcome:  A significant improvement was observed after 24 hours  with partial regression of her symptoms. Despite initial progress  48 hours post-admission  the patient's neurological status started deteriorating again  with increased slurring of speech and worsening left-sided weakness. Emergent neuroimaging suggested hemorrhagic transformation of the initial ischemic area  which was managed conservatively due to the high risk of surgery. Her blood pressure and glucose levels were tightly controlled. After a week  her condition stabilized  and her rehabilitation program was initiated.   Patient Perspective:  The patient understood her condition  including its complications and risks. She expressed gratitude for the immediate attention and care provided by the medical team  and recognized her necessity to improve her glycemic control and life habits  such as diet and exercise  to decrease risks of stroke recurrence.   Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of aggressive management and close monitoring of hypertensive and diabetic patients. Stroke  especially with a pre-existing co-morbidity  is a major medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Continuous medical education and vigilance can lead to early detection  timely management  and better prognosis of stroke even in the presence of complications.
Stroke,7,16,Case Report: Ischemic Stroke in a 68-year-old Male  Abstract:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus was admitted to the Neurology department with left-sided weakness and visual disturbances. Despite the previous diagnosis and the progressive decline in health  the patient was non-compliant with the hypertension and diabetic medication. His medical  surgical  and family history  alongside other relevant factors are discussed.   Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of weakness on the left side of the body associated with clumsiness while walking and a loss of balance. He also reported difficulty seeing things in his left field of vision. The patient was alert upon presentation and revealed that he has type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago and hypertension for the last 15 years  but he admitted to non-adherence to prescribed medications for both conditions. He has no known allergies  is a non-smoker  and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Personal and Family History:  The patient is retired and lives with his wife. He has two children  both leading healthy lives. His father died from coronary artery disease at the age of 64  and his mother has a history of stroke at 70 years old.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs were stable although blood pressure was elevated at presentation (165/90 mm Hg). Neurologic exam revealed decreased strength (4/5 motor strength) in the left upper and lower extremities  impaired coordination on the left side (as demonstrated by a Finger-to-Nose test)  and left homonymous hemianopia. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  CT scan revealed an occlusion in the right middle cerebral artery. Blood tests showed HbA1c of 8%  suggesting poor glycemic control and slightly elevated cholesterol levels. His ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of acute ischemia.  Treatment:  The patient received thrombolytic therapy with intravenous Alteplase within 3 hours of symptom onset. He was also started on antihypertensive and antihyperglycemic therapy along with a cholesterol-lowering agent (statin). Physical therapy was initiated the day after admission to assist in motor recovery.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the significance of medication adherence in managing chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes to prevent devastating sequelae  like ischemic strokes. Identification of high-risk patients  patient counselling and education about the disease  its complications  and the importance of medication compliance are essentials in the management of these patients. Also  early detection and swift management of strokes can improve outcomes and reduce disability.

Stroke,7,18,Title: Intracranial Hemorrhagic Stroke Event in a Geriatric Hypertensive Patient  Patient Profile: Mr. W  a 68-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  resided in Saginaw  Michigan with his spouse. He had no significant alcohol or tobacco use history but had a sedentary lifestyle with minimum physical activity. His diet consisted mainly of fried foods and processed meals  making it high in sodium and cholesterol.  Past Medical History: Mr. W has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes. Despite efforts of lifestyle modifications and multiple antihypertensive therapies including beta blockers and diuretics  his average blood pressure readings remained around 160/90 mmHg. He has been on Metformin for managing his blood glucose levels and a statin for managing his dyslipidemia.  Presenting Concerns: He was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) in a state of altered consciousness by his wife  who reported that she found him lying on the floor  unable to get up. The patient appeared confused with a facial droop and right side weakness. Further  he had slurred speech.  Assessment: Immediate examination revealed Mr. W's Glasgow Coma Scale was 13/15 (E4V3M6). His blood pressure was 185/102 mmHg  heart rate of 92 beats/minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. Neurological examination revealed contralateral hemiparesis and facial droop  suggestive of focal neurological deficit. His NIH Stroke Scale was calculated as 11  indicating a moderately severe stroke.  Management & Outcome: A CT scan done immediately revealed an acute left-sided intra-cerebral hemorrhage. With a consultation from neurologist  he was immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and managed conservatively with antihypertensive drugs  neuro-protective  and supportive care  given the contraindication for thrombolysis or surgical intervention in hemorrhagic stroke.  Hospital course was complicated with pneumonia  managed with appropriate antibiotics. After a lengthy hospitalization  the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further management of his neurological deficits with the aid of physical  occupational  and speech therapy.  Discussion: This case highlights the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in uncontrolled hypertensive African-American patients in their late 60's  emphasising the critical balance needed in the management of hypertension in the geriatric population. It depicts the complexities and challenges in achieving adequate blood pressure control in hypertensive patients  which is necessary to prevent such severe complications.   Conclusion: This case underlines the critical importance of aggressive management of hypertension and other modifiable risk factors  including diabetes and hyperlipidemia in preventing cerebrovascular accidents. 
Stroke,7,19,Title: An Ischemic Stroke in a Female Patient with Uncontrolled Hypertension  Introduction:  Stroke is the second leading cause of disability worldwide  and its incidence and prevalence noticeably rise as the population's age increases. Hypertension is a known significant risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. This case report details a 68-year-old Caucasian female who had a history of uncontrolled hypertension  which led to an ischemic stroke.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman from a suburban area. She had a medical history of high blood pressure for the past 10 years but often neglects taking antihypertensive medications due to side effects. She had no history of diabetes or smoking  but family history revealed her mother had multiple strokes in her later life.   The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after being found down by her daughter. Reported symptoms were slurred speech  right arm weakness  and facial droop. Upon arrival to the ED  her National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 15  which indicates moderate stroke severity. The patient's blood pressure was 190/100 mmHg. She was tachycardic but had a regular rhythm with no murmurs. Neurologic examination revealed right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia  with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14.   Her blood tests showed that her lipid profile  coagulation profile  and kidney function were all within normal ranges. However  her fasting blood glucose was slightly elevated at 112 mg/dL.  A non-contrast CT scan of the brain confirmed the presence of a large left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct  which is consistent with an ischemic stroke. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done and found no evidence of intracardiac thrombus  patent foramen ovale  or any other potential sources of emboli.  The patient was given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) since it was within the 3-hour window. She was then admitted to the Stroke Unit for further management and care. She also underwent physiotherapy and occupational therapy during her hospital stay. A secondary prevention strategy was discussed with her including the importance of regularly taking her antihypertensives and lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet  regular exercise  and limiting alcohol.

Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension for 20 years which is managed with Lisinopril. Her other significant history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cholesterol. Both conditions are controlled with metformin and a statin  respectively. There is no known previous history of stroke in the patient or the family. The patient is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.   Physical Examination: On examination  she was alert but had dysarthria. Neurologic examination showed 4/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities  mild facial droop on the right side  and expressive aphasia.   Investigations: Imaging studies included a CT scan without contrast  which revealed left middle cerebral artery territory ischemia confirming our suspicion of an acute ischemic stroke.   An EKG was performed  showing atrial fibrillation. A lipid profile was also collected and showed high cholesterol levels and LDL  while the HbA1c level was within a managed range.   Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation  which had been previously undiagnosed.  Management: The patient was administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the therapeutic window of onset of symptoms  which resulted in the patient’s mild improvement within 24 hours. She was started on Apixaban for stroke prevention due to atrial fibrillation  and further modification of antihypertensive medication was done  with increased dosage of Lisinopril.  Long-term management includes lifestyle modifications like low salt and cholesterol diet  physical exercise  and good diabetic control. Patient and caregiver education was provided regarding stroke symptoms and timely hospital visit for any future episodes.   Follow-Up: The patient demonstrated considerable improvement upon a one-month follow-up with a slight residual weakness in the right upper and lower limbs  but her speaking ability significantly improved. Her blood pressure was regularly monitored and controlled  and she was managed for her newly diagnosed atrimial fibrillation.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of regular check-ups in patients with hypertension and other risk factors to diagnose silent atrial fibrillation  a risk factor for stroke. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management can help prevent potentially life-threatening events like stroke.

Stroke,7,21,Title: A Case of Unilateral Weakness and Facial Droop in an Elderly Female: Stroke Diagnosis  I. Patient Information  The patient is a 70-year-old African-American female  a retired schoolteacher  living in a semi-urban geographical location in southern California. She was brought to the emergency department by her daughter after the sudden onset of right-sided weakness and facial droop. She has been a nonsmoker but had mild alcohol use. The patient is a widow and lives with her daughter. She has not been involved in any significant physical activity and has a history of hypertension controlled with medication.  II. Clinical Findings  On admission  the patient presented with sudden onset right-sided hemiparesis and facial droop. She had slurred speech but was lucid and understood the doctor's inquiries. Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg and heart rate of 85 beats per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 96% while breathing room air. There was no sign of trauma  and neurological examination revealed decreased strength in the right arm and leg. A facial droop was also observed on the right side of her face.   III. Diagnostic Assessment  The patient's blood workup was mostly significant for elevated blood sugar levels. An electrocardiogram indicated no acute cardiac events. Non-contrast CT of the head showed a hyperdense lesion in the left middle cerebral artery distribution  suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. An MRI confirmed the same. Carotid doppler showed mild blockage in the right internal carotid artery.  IV. Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was started on an intravenous thrombolytic agent (Alteplase) approximately 3 hours after symptom onset  as she was within the window period for thrombolytic therapy. Furthermore  a neurologist was consulted  and she was placed under care in a stroke unit where she was started on a hypertensive management regimen and aggressive physical therapy  along with her continued thrombolytic therapy.  V. Follow-up and Outcomes  The patient demonstrated gradual recovery over several weeks. With aggressive physical therapy and suitable medication  the patient was able to regain some functionality  though with residual right-sided weakness. She remained somewhat hypertensive  but it was managed with ongoing alterations in her medication regimen.  VI. Discussion   This case report suggests that quick recognition of stroke symptoms and immediate medical intervention can positively influence the prognosis in patients with stroke. This patient's hypertension and sedentary lifestyle put her at an increased risk for stroke. Despite the remaining right-sided weakness  the patient's condition improved considerably  highlighting the potential positive effects of early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. To lower her risk of recurrence  the patient was counseled on the importance of physical activity  diet control  and regular monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
Stroke,7,22,Title: An Improved Outcome of Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke in A Middle-Aged Woman with Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Patient Description: The patient  a 62-year old African-American female  lives in the urban area of Boston  Massachusetts  USA. She is a retired elementary school teacher  has two children  and is a non-smoker with an occasional alcohol intake.   Presenting Complaints: Her daughter found her unconscious in her apartment and immediately called emergency services. She reports her mother's slurred speech and difficulty moving her right arm in a phone conversation they had earlier that day.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for the past ten years  for which she takes 5mg of amlodipine daily but has been non-compliant in the recent past as revealed by her daughter. She was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  which she manages with Metformin. There's no family history of stroke but her father had myocardial infarction at the age of 70.   Clinical Findings: Upon arrival at the emergency department  her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 12. Her blood pressure was high at 200/110 mm Hg. Neurological examination uncovered hemiparesis on the right side and a positive Babinski sign. She had impaired speech and was unable to follow commands properly.  Diagnostic Procedures: An emergent non-contrast CT scan was performed revealing an acute left-sided middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct. Lab investigations showed elevated fasting blood glucose levels at 190 mg/dl and a slightly elevated HBA1c of 8.1%  indicating poor glycemic control. Her lipid profile was abnormal with elevated LDL and triglycerides. ECG indicated left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of any acute myocardial infarction.  Treatment: She was given a loading dose of IV aspirin  followed by oral aspirin 100mg per day. Meanwhile  her blood pressure was managed using intravenous Urapidil. After specialist consultation  she was deemed ineligible for thrombolysis given the time frame and extent of the presenting symptoms. She was admitted to the stroke unit and physical therapy was initiated early.  Her diabetes was managed with an insulin regimen until her glucose levels became stable.  Outcome and Follow-up: Her condition improved over the next few weeks  with physiotherapy aiding the in recovery of motor function though mild weakness persisted. A strict diet plan was advised in collaboration with a dietitian and regular monitoring of her blood pressure and blood glucose levels were instructed. She was referred to a cardiologist and neurologist for outpatient follow-up.  Conclusion: Strong family and social support  aggressive management of her hypertension and diabetes  and early physiotherapy contributed to an improved stroke outcome  in this case  underscoring the need for prompt medical attention and treatment compliance in patients with high-risk comorbidities.
Stroke,7,23,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke Secondary to Atrial Fibrillation in a 74-year-old African American Female  I. Patient Demographics Patient Information: 74-year-old African American female Occupation: Retired Nurse Residential Area: Urban Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of slurred speech  right-sided weakness with difficulty in walking  II. Past Medical History The patient has a known case of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (Afib) diagnosed six years ago. She is on medication for both conditions: Atenolol 50mg/day for hypertension and Warfarin 2.5mg/day as anticoagulant therapy for Afib. Unfortunately  the patient's last International Normalized Ratio (INR) was suboptimal at 1.9 about two months ago  suggesting the undercoagulation status. Besides  she also has a history of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been an ex-smoker for ten years and does not consume alcohol.  She had no known allergies. Her family history is significant for stroke and cardiovascular diseases. She lives alone and is functionally independent.  On discussion  she revealed poor medication adherence  primarily due to the inconvenience of frequent INR checks and her belief that she had been feeling well.  III. Clinical Findings Upon examination  her blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg  and irregularly irregular pulse was noted. Neurological findings were suggestive of left hemisphere involvement  including right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) was recorded as 14.  IV. Diagnosis and Treatment Plan Prompt neuro-imaging with CT scan was performed  which revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. The findings  coupled with her clinical presentation  history of Afib  and the suboptimal INR  led to the confirmatory diagnosis of an ischemic stroke secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon due to poorly controlled atrial fibrillation.  The patient was beyond the time window for thrombolysis. Therefore  she was immediately started on an intravenous infusion of labetalol for blood pressure control and switched over to a DOAC for her atrial fibrillation with a plan for closer follow-up and medication adherence counselling.  V. Follow-up The patient was referred to an interdisciplinary team comprising physical  occupational and speech therapists for her rehabilitation. Given the patient's social situation (living alone) and newly acquired disabilities  a comprehensive plan was made for home adaptation and potential caregiver assistance.  This case highlights the importance of a patient-centered approach  with emphasis on proper medication adherence and counselling  more so in elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities. More patient-friendly approaches like DOACs in place of warfarin  although cost-prohibitive  might assist in better compliance leading to improved outcomes in such scenarios.

Stroke,7,27,Title: Case Report on a Stroke Patient: A 72-Year-Old African American Male   Patient Presentation:   A 72-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with an acute stroke. The patient was transported by emergency medical services approximately 2.5 hours after symptom onset. He was found to have left side weakness  facial droop and difficulty in speaking which had started suddenly. His wife reported that he seemed confused and his speech was slurred.   Demographics: Race - African American Age - 72 years Gender - Male  Marital Status - Married Occupation - Retired Banker  Medical History: The patient’s history includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction approximately eight years previously. He also smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past fifty years  and had a sedentary lifestyle due to restrictions on physical activity following his myocardial infarction.  Examination: On examination  patient's blood pressure was elevated (190/110mmHg). His Body Mass Index was 28 suggesting overweight. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 16  which indicated a moderately severe stroke. The brain imaging was promptly conducted which revealed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion  and the patient was subsequently thrombolyzed with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).  Outcome and follow-up: The patient responded well to the immediate thrombolysis. His NIHSS score improved to 7 over the next 24 hours indicating a significant decrease in the severity of his stroke symptoms. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility after 5 days in the hospital. His discharge plan included an antiplatelet drug  statin therapy  antihypertensive medication  and insulin for his diabetes mellitus. He was also referred to smoking cessation program and dietary counseling. Follow-up after one month showed further improvements with a NIHSS score of 3 and patient regained much of his arm strength and his speech improved. However  mild residual weakness was still evident on his left side. His risk factors had been well-controlled.   Discussion: This case illustrates the common theme of risk factors of stroke  notably poorly controlled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  a history of cardiac disease  and smoking. Based on literature  the African American population has higher incidence and prevalence rates of stroke compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Moreover  their stroke events are more severe and have higher mortality rates. Thus  it underscores the importance of preventative measures  such as regular screening  better control of comorbidities  promoting healthier lifestyles  and smoking cessation especially among high risk populations.

Stroke,7,31,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 65-year-old African American Female with a History of Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Introduction: Stroke  one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide  is multifactorial and complex to manage particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Here  we discuss the case of a 65-year-old African American female presenting with acute ischemic stroke who had known hypertension  diabetes mellitus and a family history of stroke.  Case Report: Patient Information: A 65-year-old African American female patient was presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a sudden onset of confusion  facial droop on the left side  and difficulty speaking.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient was found to have weakness on the left side of her body. Her blood pressure was 165/90 mmHg  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and her blood glucose level was elevated at 200 mg/dL.  Medical History: The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which she was taking metformin and lisinopril respectively. Her father had died of a stroke at the age of 70.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: The patient’s symptoms and medical history suggested a possible stroke. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed that showed a thromboembolic event in the right hemisphere. An electrocardiogram revealed an irregular heartbeat suggestive of atrial fibrillation.  Therapeutic Intervention: The neurologist on call evaluated the patient and intravenous tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) was administered within the therapeutic window  following the confirmation of ischemic stroke.  Follow-up and Outcomes: After receiving tPA  the patient’s symptoms improved somewhat  though some mild weakness and language difficulties persisted. She was started on anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation and was referred to a stroke rehabilitation program.  Conclusion: In African Americans  stroke is more prevalent and more fatal  linked significantly with comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes which our patient had. Her case further highlights the importance of quick response and intervention in the emergency department for prompt administration of tPA – a proven therapy in reducing disability caused by acute ischemic stroke. Lifelong management of hypertension  diabetes  and AF is essential in lowering stroke recurrence and overall cardiovascular risks in such high-risk populations.
Stroke,7,32,"Title: Ischemic Stroke in a 65-Year-Old African American Male with Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Report  I. Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male residing in an urban setting of New York. He is retired and lives alone. He has a history of smoking  consumes alcohol moderately and maintains a poor diet  chiefly consisting of high-fat  high-sodium foods. He is not physically active and his body mass index (BMI) is 28  placing him in the overweight category.  II. Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset confusion  slurred speech  and left-sided weakness.  III. History of Present Illness:  The patient's symptoms reportedly started early in the morning upon waking up from sleep. He had difficulty speaking and experienced sudden weakness on the left side of his body which led to a fall. He managed to reach the phone and call a neighbor for help  who subsequently contacted emergency services.  IV. Past Medical History:  He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago but reports inconsistent management due to his reluctance towards regular medication usage. He occasionally takes antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) when he feels """"uncomfortable"""" but not on a daily routine as prescribed. He has no history of diabetes or any cardiac conditions. The patient refuses to undergo regular health screenings  so his 10-year-old diagnosis of hypertension might hide other undiagnosed medical conditions.  V. Diagnostic Assessment:  Upon admission  his blood pressure was significantly elevated (190/110 mm Hg). Neurological findings suggested left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed a fresh infarct in the right middle cerebral artery region  confirming an ischemic stroke. His blood glucose level was normal  but blood lipid profile showed elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram were normal.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset per guidelines. His hypertension was managed aggressively with labetalol and lisinopril to maintain BP within an acceptable range for stroke patients.  VII. Follow Up and Outcome:  Considering his previous non-adherence to medication  case management became involved to ensure proper patient education and follow-up. Rehabilitation therapy was initiated to manage left-side weakness and improve mobility. Lifestyle modifications including a low-sodium diet  regular physical activity  smoking cessation  and limiting alcohol consumption were discussed.  VIII. Learning Points:  This case highlights the importance of patient education and regular compliance to antihypertensive therapies. Non-adherence can lead to poorly controlled hypertension and potentially result in catastrophic outcomes such as stroke. Ensuring that patients understand the vital need for strict compliance to therapy can prevent such major complications. This particular case also emphasizes the high risk of stroke among African Americans  which is partly due to higher rates of hypertension and more severe blood pressure elevation.  "
Stroke,7,33,Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired engineer and currently resides in the suburbs of New Jersey  US. The patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes for which he is on medication. He is a former smoker and quit about ten years ago. He reports being generally physically active  but his diet is reported to be high in sodium and low in vegetables and fruits.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden weakness on the left side of his body  inability to speak coherently  and reported a feeling of confusion.  Medical observations: At the time of emergency admission  his blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg  pulse was 92 beats per minute  and blood glucose level was reported to be 245 mg/dl. On physical examination  the patient exhibited facial droop on the left side  slight drooling  and difficulty in moving the left limbs. He was unable to understand or follow commands and his speech was slurred and incomprehensible.  Investigations: His Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillations. A non-contrast CT scan of the brain revealed a large ischemic infarct at the right Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory  confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.  Treatment and management: The patient was not a candidate for thrombolysis due to a delay in presentation. Antihypertensives were administered to control his blood pressure. For stroke management  he was started on Aspirin (antiaggregation) and Atorvastatin (lipid-lowering). Blood sugar levels were controlled with insulin.  Course and prognosis: Post-stabilization  he was transferred to a stroke unit for specialized care and rehabilitation. His speech improved over the following days  though he still struggled with complex sentences. Motor function gradually improved with physical therapy though residual weakness was apparent.   The patient received education on dietary modification and medication adherence. He was discharged home with a plan for cardiac rehabilitation  physiotherapy  and regular outpatient follow-ups. His future risk of recurrent stroke will depend on adequate risk factor management primarily blood pressure  blood sugar  and medication adherence.  Signed  [Doctor's Name] [Institution's Name]
Stroke,7,34,Title: An Intracranial Hemorrhagic Stroke in a Diabetic  Hypertensive Patient: A Case Report  Patient Information: Patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and premature minor strokes. He lives in a mid-size city in the South-East of the USA. The patient is a retired truck driver and a reformed smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 30-year pack-a-day habit. He lives with his wife and has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Findings: The patient was brought to the emergency department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and facial drooping. On admission  he was found to be afebrile  with a blood pressure of 190/100 mm Hg  a pulse of 90 beats/min  and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. Neurological examination confirmed weakness in right upper and lower limbs.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory tests demonstrated a random blood sugar level of 280 mg/dl  creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dl  and lipid profile indicating hypercholesterolemia. A brain Computerized Tomography (CT) scan showed left cerebral hemisphere intracranial hemorrhage. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram ruled out cardiac etiology for his symptoms.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the stroke unit  where his blood pressure and glucose levels were managed. Due to the hemorrhagic nature of the stroke  thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated. He was started on aggressive blood pressure control  with an initial goal to reduce systolic blood pressure to 140 mm Hg. Insulin was started for the management of his hyperglycemia.  Follow-Up & Outcomes: The patient's strength improved gradually over the course of two weeks  concurrent physical and speech therapy was initiated. A repeat CT scan done post 2 weeks showed stabilization of the intracranial bleed. Unfortunately  despite initial improvements  the patient is left with mild residual weakness and speech impairment. Clinic appointments with neurology  endocrinology  and his primary care physician have been arranged for ongoing optimal management of his diabetes  hypertension  and stroke sequelae.  Patient Perspective: The patient was generally appreciative of the care he received but expressed delay in understanding the severity of his medical conditions previously. He also accessed diabetes clinics and hypertensive clinics for regular follow-ups and expressed the goal of improving his lifestyle to prevent further complications.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of aggressive management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in high-risk individuals to prevent the catastrophic consequences of stroke. Moreover  the need for regular follow-ups and patient education about the importance of medication compliance cannot be overstated. Another notable point is that vascular risk factors disproportionately affect Black American populations  suggesting the need for strategies to improve healthcare access and delivery for minorities.
Stroke,7,35,CASE REPORT  Patient Information:   Mr. W.R.  a 69-year-old African American male  was admitted to the tertiary care setting after experiencing sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking.  Medical History:   The patient has a known history of hypertension  which was diagnosed 10 years ago  and is controlled with Lisinopril 20mg daily. He is also a previous smoker  having quit 5 years ago  but had a smoking history of 20 pack-years. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 was diagnosed 7 years ago  managed with Metformin 1000mg twice daily. There is no documented history of alcohol or substance abuse. His family history reveals that his father had an Ischemic Stroke at the age of 71.  Current Condition:   Upon admission  the patient was alert and oriented to person  place  and time but demonstrated slurred speech and severe aphasia. He had right-sided hemiparesis and facial droop. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 21  indicating a severe stroke.  Investigations & Results:   A CT scan of the brain revealed an early Ischemic Stroke in the left middle cerebral artery distribution  confirmed by an MR Angiography which revealed occlusion in the left MCA. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL cholesterol (145 mg/dL). Fasting blood glucose was also elevated (193 mg/dL). The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of atrial fibrillation. Neuroimaging confirmed the diagnosis of an Ischemic Stroke.   Hospital Course:  The patient arrived 2 hours post-symptom onset and was immediately given a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). Despite this  persistent occlusion of the left MCA was noted  thus he underwent mechanical thrombectomy successfully within a timely manner.   Post-procedure  he was admitted to the Stroke Unit for further care and management. His antihypertensive regimen was adjusted  and he was started on Atorvastatin 80 mg daily along with dual antiplatelets therapy (DAPT) - Aspirin 81 mg daily plus Clopidogrel 75 mg daily. His blood glucose levels were managed with appropriate diet and Insulin therapy.   Additionally  he was referred to physiotherapy for rehabilitative care. His condition gradually improved over weeks. His speech began to return with noticeable clarity  and he experienced significant improvement in his right-side motor function with only slight residual weakness by the time of his discharge.   Follow Up:  Mr. W.R. was discharged with an outpatient follow-up plan  including regular monitoring by his primary care physician and referrals to a cardiologist and endocrinologist for management of his hypertension and diabetes  respectively. Speech and physical therapy were also recommended for his continued rehabilitation.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of rapid assessment and intervention in the event of a suspected stroke. It also underlines the role of comprehensive preventive and post-stroke care for comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus to minimize the risk of recurrence.

He is an active smoker with a 20-pack year history. He consumes alcohol socially and describes his diet as “standard american cuisine”.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson's medical record reveals a history of hypertension  well controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily for the past 10 years. He also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  managed with metformin 500mg twice daily  but with inconsistent control as identified in fluctuating HbA1c values. His last recorded HbA1c 3 months ago was 9.2%. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago and is using atorvastatin 20mg daily. His last LDL was 110 mg/dL. He is not currently on anticoagulant therapy. His family history is positive for stroke in his mother and diabetes in both parents. He has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaint and Examination:  Mr. Johnson was brought to the hospital in the early morning hours when his wife noticed he was struggling to get out of bed  presenting with signs of motor impairment on his right side. When EMS arrived  the patient was also found to have dysarthria and a corner of the mouth droop indicative of facial palsy. No complaints of headache  vision changes  or loss of consciousness were reported.  Neurological Examination revealed right hemiplegia (absence of voluntary movement) and hemianesthesia (loss of sensation) with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 18. Other immediate test results showed blood glucose levels of 198 mg/dl under fasting conditions  and an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.  Diagnosis:   Mr. Johnson’s symptoms  along with the findings from his clinical and neurological examinations  are indicative of an acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery.  Plan:  Mr. Johnson was immediately started on intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)  given he was within the 4.5-hour window post symptom onset. Arrangements were made for an emergency brain CT scan  which later confirmed the absence of hemorrhage and hence supportive of the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. He was planned to be started on aspirin 325mg daily  later to be decreased to 81mg after a few weeks  as secondary prevention based on current AHA stroke guidelines. His atorvastatin was planned to be uptitrated to 80mg daily in line with current stroke prevention guidelines. He was also advised  along with his wife  about the benefits of smoking cessation  moderated alcohol consumption  and maintaining a heart-healthy diet  with consideration of referral to dietary and cessation support services.   Follow-up:  Long-term management involves rigorous control of his diabetes and hypertension  continuation of his antiplatelet therapy and statin. He would be reviewed in the stroke clinic after discharge  with more frequent follow ups initially. The plan also includes referral to rehabilitation services for assessment and physical  occupational and speech therapy after his medical condition stabilize. Finally  Mr. Johnson's social circumstances - living with his wife  retired - would require evaluation for potential home modifications to accommodate his post-stroke disability  and the need for in-home physical rehabilitation. His wife is current primary caregiver  but should additional help be required  an evaluation would be made for external agency assistance.

Stroke,7,44,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 67-Year-Old African American Male with Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus   Patient Information:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male who presented at our facility with sudden onset weakness in the right limbs and slurred speech.  Medical History:  Significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  both controlled on medications. His medication regimen includes Metformin 500mg bid for diabetes and Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension. No known drug allergies. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history but quit 15 years ago. No known family history of stroke. No previous history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes. His adherence to medication schedule and lifestyle modification has been occasionally inconsistent in the past. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and his diet is rich in sodium and carbohydrates with minimal fruits and vegetables intake.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared distressed with noticeable slurring of speech. He had a blood pressure of 175/95 mmHg  a heart rate of 98 beats per minute  and a blood glucose level of 250 mg/dL. A NIH stroke scale scored 12. Neurological examination showed acute onset expressive aphasia  right-sided hemiparesis  and homonymous hemianopia. No signs of infection were noted and cardiopulmonary examination was normal.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent MRI Brain without contrast showed an acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic infarction. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Blood and urine tests revealed poor glycemic control and elevated lipid profile but no signs of infection or kidney disease. An echocardiogram was unremarkable  thereby reducing the suspicion of a cardioembolic source. Carotid Doppler indicated significant stenosis in the left internal carotid artery  suggesting large artery atherosclerosis as a potential mechanism of the stroke.  Therapeutic Intervention & Follow-Up:  After a discussion with his family  it was decided not to proceed with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration due to the relative contraindication of uncontrolled hypertension and elevated blood glucose levels. Antihypertensive and insulin were administered to control the blood pressure and hyperglycemia followed by initiation of antiplatelet therapy. He was treated under a comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program  including physiotherapy and speech therapy. He was advised to follow a low salt  low carb diet  and regular exercise. His hypertension  diabetes  and the newly added antiplatelet regimen will need to be closely monitored on future visits. Stroke education and smoking cessation counseling were added to his recovery and prevention plan.  Patient Education:  The patient was educated regarding the importance of medication adherence  blood pressure control  glycemic control  a healthier diet  regular exercise  and routine follow-ups.  This case report emphasizes the significant impact of modifiable risk factors in stroke occurrence and the importance of public health efforts towards early detection and management of these risk factors not only in the African American population but across all demographic groups.

Management: After ruling out contraindications for thrombolysis  the patient received IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) about three and a half hours from the onset of his symptoms as per acute ischemic stroke guidelines.   Outcome and Follow-up: Mr. Smith’s affordable functional recovery was noted at a three-month follow-up with improvements in his communication skills and motor function. His NIHSS score improved to 4  and he was enrolled in a rehabilitation program. He was also started on Clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention.  Learning Points:  1. Mr. Smith's case reinforces the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms promptly and following established stroke treatment guidelines. 2. It underlines the importance of continuous management and regular follow-up of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in patients with a history of TIA or stroke. 3. It showcases the potential for significant patient improvement when treated promptly with appropriate management. 4. Rehabilitation is an essential part of stroke management to recover as much function as possible and return to independent living.
Stroke,7,46,Title: An Intracerebral Hemorrhage in A Hypertensive African American Female: A Case Report   Patient Presentation:   A 60-year-old African American woman  working as a school teacher  residing in Alabama  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of hemiparesis on her right side  slurred speech  and an inability to maintain balance. The symptoms started suddenly while she was conducting her online classes at home. The patient was reported to be in her normal health condition till the symptoms appeared. An examination revealed an acutely ill-looking patient  anxious  with a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension for over 15 years  for which she has been on medication (amlodipine 5mg  hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily). The patient also reported poorly managed T2DM (type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) for 10 years  managed on Metformin 500mg  twice daily. Family history indicated that the patient's father died of a stroke  and her sister is a diagnosed hypertensive patient. The patient has a past history of smoking (10 cigarettes/day) and alcohol use  specifically red wine (1-2 glasses/day)  both of which she stopped about 8 years ago.  Clinical Findings:  Neurological assessment revealed right-sided weakness (muscle power 2/5)  slurred speech without any aphasia  slightly decreased sensations on the right side  and dysarthria. The rest of the cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Examination of the chest and other systems did not reveal any abnormalities.   Diagnostic Assessment:  The CT scan of her brain showed left parietal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage with moderate mass effect. Hemoglobin A1c was 9.2%  indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Fasting lipid profile showed hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 237 mg/dL  HDL 35mg/dL  LDL 132 mg/dl  triglycerides 198 mg/dL). Fasting blood glucose was 206mg/dL.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit  received antihypertensive and intravenous insulin therapy. Neurosurgery consultation was sought  and the decision was made to manage the patient conservatively due to the location and relative stability of the patient.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Post admission  the patient continued showing signs of stabilization and minor improvement in right-sided weakness following treatment. Her blood pressure was controlled  and she was shifted to the ward on the fifth day. She received physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the hospital  which was continued upon discharge. The patient was recommended for a follow-up in the stroke clinic and referred to a diabetes clinic for better control of her blood sugar levels.   Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of meticulously managing hypertension and diabetes  given their closeness in relation to the high stroke risk. The patient's demographic profile  heritage  and personal lifestyle had influenced her health status significantly  shedding light on the continued need to address health disparities and elucidate the role of individual and socio-economic factors in disease risk. 
Stroke,7,47,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 68-year Old Male with Hypertension and Diabetes  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old African American man was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of weakness in the right side of the body  difficulty in speech  and facial drooping noted when he woke up from sleep. He lives with his wife and they have no children. He is a retired factory worker and is currently unemployed  and a non-smoker. He has a medical history of systemic hypertension (for 15 years) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (for 8 years)  both of which are treated with oral medications. He is not known to abuse substances or alcohol and there is no history of stroke in his immediate family.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  vital signs were stable. The patient was alert  coherent but had noticeable aphasia. The neurological examination showed signs of right hemiparesis (strength  2/5) and right facial droop. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13  indicating moderate to severe stroke.   Diagnostic Assessment: Blood analysis revealed that he had slightly raised fasting glucose levels and HbA1c levels. Lipid profile showed elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels. CT scan of the brain showed a hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign indicating vessel occlusion  consistent with acute ischemic stroke. An ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of atrial fibrillation.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the presentation within the therapeutic window (less than 4.5 hours since waking with symptoms)  the patient was administered intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Post t-PA protocol  he was transferred to intensive care for 24 hours for continuous monitoring.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient's symptoms improved mildly over time. At hospital discharge  his right side weakness improved to strength 4/5  but persistent mild aphasia remained. He was prescribed antiplatelets  statin therapy  along with antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs. A referral for outpatient physiotherapy and speech therapy for language rehabilitation was done. Post discharge follow-ups were advised on a regular basis.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the critical need for timely intervention in acute ischemic stroke. The case also emphasizes the significance of primary prevention strategies and strict control of common modifiable risk factors like hypertension and diabetes in minimizing the risk of stroke.

Stroke,7,48,Case Report: Ischemic Stroke in an elder male patient  I. Patient Information Name: Confidential (for the purposes of this report  let's call him John) Sex: Male  Age: 75 years old Ethnicity: African American  Living Environment: Urban Occupational History: Retired  former accountant  II. Chief Complaint John presented in the Emergency Department (ED) with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and facial droop. The symptoms occurred approximately two hours prior to hospital arrival.  III. Medical History John is a known hypertensive for 18 years  poorly controlled as evidenced by his blood pressure record throughout the years. He has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He is also known to have hyperlipidemia for 10 years and is on statin therapy. He experienced a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) 5 years ago  which was medically managed. He is a smoker with over 50-year pack history. There is no known history of similar cases in his family.  IV. Physical Examination Findings On examination  his blood pressure was elevated at 190/110 mmHg  heart rate normal at 70 beats per minute  body temperature normal at 36.7°C  and respiratory rate normal at 16 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormalities. Neurological examination showed right hemiplegia  expressive aphasia  facial droop on the right side  and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 18. His sensory function on the right side was also diminished.  V. Diagnostic Tests A non-contrast CT scan of the brain confirmed an acute ischemic stroke with a large infarct in the area served by the left middle cerebral artery.  VI. Diagnosis John was diagnosed with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke.  VII. Treatment Upon diagnosis  IV thrombolysis was administered as John was within the therapeutic window for receiving tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Despite his high blood pressure  it was decided to give IV tPA under close blood pressure monitoring. This decision was based on the high NIHSS score indicating severe stroke  where the benefits of thrombolysis outweigh the risks of potential hemorrhagic conversion. Aggressive blood pressure management was started. Long-term plans for rehabilitation  lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation  diet)  and adherence to medications were discussed.  VIII. Discussion John’s stroke risk factors included advanced age  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  previous TIA  and smoking. Perhaps his hypertensive status had the most significant role; uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to various complications  including stroke. Also  his African American ethnicity is associated with a comparatively higher risk of stroke. This case illustrates the need for improved control and management of modifiable risk factors to prevent debilitating illnesses like stroke in the elderly population.  NB: Consent for publication was obtained from John.   Reference: Morgenstern LB  Smith MA  Lisabeth LD  et al.

Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both managed with medications for over a decade. The family history reveals a father who suffered a stroke in his mid-70s. The patient has a 20-year history of tobacco use but quit five years ago. Patient occasionally consumes alcohol  but in controlled amounts.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient presented with a blood pressure of 165/98 mmHg. There were notable signs of speech difficulty and right-sided muscle weakness  alongside diminished reflexes on the right side.   Investigations: Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Blood tests showed slightly increased blood glucose levels and a high cholesterol.   Diagnosis: Ischemic Stroke.   Treatment: Patient was immediately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  a clot-busting drug  as per the American Stroke Association guidelines for treating acute ischemic stroke. He was later put on ongoing anticoagulant therapy along with aggressive risk factor management including control of blood pressure  diabetes  and cholesterol level.  Prognosis: With optimal management of his comorbidities  as well as physiotherapy to regain right-sided muscle strength  his prognosis is cautiously optimistic. However  given his age  prior stroke history in the family  and his historical lifestyle factors  a complete recovery may be challenging.   Summary: This case highlights an instance of an acute ischemic stroke in a 72-year-old African-American male with pre-existing hypertension  type-2 diabetes  and a family history of stroke. The patient's delayed presentation post-symptoms onset may be due to the lack of awareness about the signs of stroke. It underscores the importance of early symptom recognition and immediate medical attention in improving the prognosis of stroke patients. It also emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive preventive measures for individuals with high vascular risk factors.

He lives alone and is widowed for five years. He has two adult children who are engaged in their respective professions.   Medical History   Mr. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension diagnosed ten years ago  manageable with amlodipine (10 mg daily)  and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed seven years back  being maintained on daily oral metformin (1500 mg). He had cardiac arrhythmia detected about three years ago  and atrial fibrillation specifically  which is being controlled with prescription medication. He is known to have smoked almost a pack of cigarettes daily since his mid-twenties but had quit ten years ago. Also  Mr. X has mild chronic kidney disease (Stage 3 CKD) and has been on a restricted diet for the same.   Reason for Current Hospital Admission   Mr. X was brought to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset right-sided weakness  difficulty in speaking and confusion. These symptoms had developed suddenly while he was having lunch at home. His neighbor called for ambulance services when he noticed signs of distress.   Examination and Diagnosis   On arrival  the patient was hemiplegic on the right side with a noticeable facial droop and slurred speech. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was found to be 15 (severe stroke). An emergency CT head scan showed an area of infarction in the left Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory  suggesting an acute ischemic stroke. A cardiac echo revealed atrial fibrillation with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%.   Discussion   This case represents a clinical scenario of acute ischemic stroke in the elderly population. The common risk factors include age  male gender  a history of hypertension  diabetes  atrial fibrillation  past smoking  and chronic kidney disease. These factors have been found to be consistent with the demographics reported in the extensive literature on cerebral stroke. Ischemic strokes represent a significant percentage of cerebral stroke cases and are generally associated with a considerable degree of morbidity and mortality  making their prompt recognition and management crucial.   Mr. X's case shows that despite being at an increased risk for stroke due to multiple risk factors  his symptoms were recognized promptly  thereby initiating immediate medical intervention that potentially reduced the severity of his condition. His case also serves as a reminder about the importance of comprehensive long-term management of atrial fibrillation and other risk factors in reducing stroke incidence.   Following his stroke  Mr. X was started on aspirin and atorvastatin  along with adjusting his antihypertensive medication and Increasing the anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. His management plan also now includes intensive physiotherapy  speech and language therapy  in addition to optimized preventive therapies to manage his comorbidities.

Stroke,7,54,Case Report: Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) in a 65-Year Old Male  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  who is a smoker for over 40 years. He lives with his wife in an urban setting. He has a family history of hypertension and stroke.  Chief Complaint: The patient was brought to the emergency department of the local hospital by his wife due to a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and sudden loss of balance.  History of Present Illness: The patient was initially in his usual state of health until two hours prior to presentation  when he suddenly developed right-sided weakness  facial droop  and slurred speech. His wife reportedly found him on the floor  unable to stand on his own.    Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension  which was diagnosed 10 years ago  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago. His medication history includes Lisinopril and Metformin. However  he was non-compliant with his medications and has reported not taking any medications for the past 3 months. He has no known allergies.   On-going Care and Treatment: On admission  the patient’s blood pressure was markedly elevated at 190/100 mmHg. His random blood glucose was also dangerously high at 290 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was immediately obtained and showed an acute infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery.  The patient was administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) immediately and subsequent management revolved around hypertensive and hyperglycemic management in accordance with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Consequently  he was admitted to the stroke unit for close monitoring and initiated on aspirin  Statin  Lisinopril and insulin. Speech therapy  occupational therapy and physical therapy were also initiated for rehabilitation.  Discussion: Our case highlights the complex challenge posed by patients with multiple uncontrolled risk factors for stroke. Despite knowing his diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes  the patient  unfortunately  demonstrated poor medication and lifestyle compliance  leading to this life-threatening emergency. It emphasizes the need for effective strategies to promote medication compliance  the importance of controlling blood pressure and blood glucose levels  and better availability of preventive care for such at-risk individuals.   Although no two stroke patients present the same way  our patient’s symptoms of right-sided weakness  facial droop  and slurred speech are very typical of left middle cerebral artery infarction. Furthermore  given the history of hypertension  smoking  diabetes  the patient was at high risk for stroke.  Conclusion: Stroke is a major health concern  particularly in individuals with modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. Early recognition of symptoms as well as aggressive risk factor management is essential in preventing devastating consequences.   This case underscores the importance of patient awareness and the invaluable role of evidence-based medical management in stroke prevention. Future efforts should aim to better understand barriers to care and to develop interventions that promote compliance and control of risk factors  especially in high-risk populations.
Stroke,7,55,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 65-year-old African American Male With History of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  Patient Information: Mr. James  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of an acute stroke. He was immediately trialed on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and scored 15  indicative of moderate to severe stroke. He is a resident of Jacksonville  Florida  lives with his wife  and is a retired high school teacher.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus  which have been managed with antihypertensive (Lisinopril)  statin therapy (Atorvastatin)  and oral hypoglycemics (Metformin)  respectively  over the past 10 years.   He is a non-smoker and reports an active lifestyle which involved walking 3-4 times a week -- although he acknowledges he had been less active in recent months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. No past surgical history is recorded.  Clinical Findings: On examination  Mr. James had right-sided weakness  aphasia  and mild facial droop but was alert and oriented to time  person  and place. His vitals were stable: BP- 142/90 mm Hg  HR- 84/min  RR- 18/min  and Temp- 97.6°F.  Diagnostic Assessment: A non-contrast CT scan of the head was performed showing small acute infarctions in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery hinting at an ischemic stroke. His blood work recorded mild elevation in his LDL cholesterol level (140 mg/dL) and fasting blood glucose level (190 mg/dl).  Therapeutic Intervention: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administered within 3.5 hours of symptom onset as there were no contraindications like recent surgery  history of hemorrhagic stroke  or current anticoagulant use with international normalized ratio (INR) more than 1.7 or prothrombin time (PT) greater than 15 seconds.  Mr. James was admitted to the stroke unit for further investigation  anticoagulation  blood pressure  lipid  and glucose control  as well as physical and speech therapy.   Discharge and Follow-up: In due course  Mr. James showed some improvement and was discharged home with continued outpatient therapy. He was advised to maintain his medication for hypertension  diabetes and hyperlipidemia  and was additionally prescribed Aspirin to prevent recurrent strokes. Follow-up appointments with Neurology  Endocrinology and Cardiology were scheduled for further assessment and management.   In conclusion  this report highlighted how the early recognition and administration of appropriate therapeutic interventions can effectively manage acute stroke which significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Prevention strategies  patient education  and follow-ups should be a priority considering the patient's risk factors. 
Stroke,7,56,Title: A Case Report on Late Presentation of Stroke in an Elderly Female Patient  Patient Information:  A 76-year-old African-American female presented to the emergency department of our clinic  escorted by her daughter. She was known to have a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  both adequately controlled with medications.  Chief Complaints:  The patient's daughter reported that her mother had suddenly developed slurred speech and weakness on the right side of the body. These symptoms had started approximately five hours prior to their arrival at the hospital.  Past Medical History:  The patient's medical history included hypertension  for which she had been prescribed amlodipine 5mg once daily  and Type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin 500mg twice a day. The patient did not smoke or consume alcohol. She also denied any history of heart disease or previous strokes. There was no family history of stroke or other neurological diseases.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient was alert but anxious with blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and blood glucose level of 8.6 mmol/L. Neurological examination revealed mild dysarthria  right-sided facial droop  and right-sided hemiparesis. Her speech was slurred  but language comprehension was intact. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was calculated to be 5.  Investigations:  A CT scan of the brain ruled out a hemorrhagic stroke. She was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. However  the patient was not eligible for thrombolytic therapy as she presented beyond the recommended window of 4.5hours.  Treatment:  Due to the woman’s late presentation  receiving tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) was not an option. She was admitted to the stroke unit and started on an antiplatelet drug as per the standard protocol. Neurology  cardiology  and endocrinology services were consulted. Control of modifiable risk factors  such as blood pressure and blood glucose  was optimized.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the dangers of delayed hospital presentations in cases of stroke. The reasons for the delay were multifactorial  but lack of recognition of stroke signs played a significant part. It emphasizes the importance of public health initiatives to educate about stroke symptoms and the urgency of immediate medical care.
Stroke,7,57,Title: A Case of Ischemic Stroke in an Elderly Woman with Hypertension and Atrial Fibrillation  Case Report:  Patient Information: A 69-year-old Caucasian female presented herself to the emergency department due to sudden onset of weakness in her right side of the body and slurred speech. The symptoms have been persistent for approximately 2 hours prior to hospital admission. The patient resides in an urban setting and is a retired schoolteacher. She lives with her husband  a retired mechanic. She is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed right-sided hemiparesis  facial droop  and dysarthria  indicative of a possible stroke. The patient scored 12 on the NIH Stroke Scale on admission. Further  the patient was found to be alert but seemed anxious and confused.  History: The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and non-valvular atrial fibrillation  for which she was on medication (atenolol and warfarin). She was otherwise healthy. Her recent INR was 2.4  within therapeutic range for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. There is no family history of strokes or heart disease.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: The patient underwent a brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast  which ruled out a hemorrhagic stroke. MRI imaging confirmed an acute ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. An ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation but showed no signs of acute ischemic changes. An echocardiogram revealed no intracardiac thrombus or significant valvular disease.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the busy nature of the hospital at the time of admission  the thrombolysis window (4.5 hours) was unfortunately missed. Given the patient's risk factors and the nature of her stroke  she was initiated on aspirin (81mg daily)  atorvastatin (80mg daily) and her current therapeutic warfarin was continued. She was also referred to speech-pathology  physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation.  Follow-up and Outcomes: She responded well to the therapy during her hospital stay and was stable enough to be discharged after 7 days of admission. Her hemiparesis and dysarthria showed significant improvement with therapy over time. Blood pressure was well managed with modified antihypertensive regimen during her stay. At one-month follow-up  she was living at home and receiving outpatient rehabilitation services.   Patient Perspective: The abrupt onset of her symptoms and her experience in the hospital left the patient with significant fear and anxiety. Patient health education regarding preventive lifestyle modifications  importance of adherence to her medications was given to empower her to actively participate in her recovery and reduce risk of future strokes.  Conclusion: This case underscores the need for timely management to limit disability in stroke  the critical role of long-term therapeutic management in patients with high-risk factors and the role of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in improving outcomes for stroke patients.

He has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which are reasonably controlled with oral medication. Further  he has an aversion to tobacco and alcohol.  Case Presentation: The patient was brought to the emergency department with an acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech  beginning approximately one hour before arrival. On initial assessment  the patient appeared confused  with evident right-sided facial droop  and inability to raise his right arm. His speech was slurred but he was able to follow small commands. Clinical examination confirmed right-sided hemiparesis and expressive dysphasia  suggesting left-sided brain injury.   Initial Evaluation and Progress: His blood pressure in the emergency room was notably high (200/120 mmHg) - a hypertensive emergency. The blood glucose level was slightly elevated (180 mg/dL). An urgent non-contrast CT scan of the head showed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct  without hemorrhage.   Given the patient’s presentation and radiologic findings  a diagnosis of acute left MCA ischemic stroke was made.   Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately started on IV tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) within the therapeutic window after ruling out contraindications. His hypertension was managed concurrently. Post fibrinolytic therapy  his symptoms remarkably improved within 48 hours  with residual minor weakness in the right upper limb.  Long-term secondary stroke prevention was initiated with aspirin  statin  and a revised antihypertensive regimen. Intense physical and speech rehabilitation was implemented during the patient's hospital stay and was continued post-release.  Learning points: This case highlights the potential devastating outcomes of poor hypertension management  especially in the elderly population with prior cardiovascular comorbidities. It stresses the need for regular and more thorough follow-ups and health education in this demographic for early identification and timely management of such episodes. Furthermore  it points to the importance of emergency health services and rapid  effective acute stroke care in improving patient outcomes.
Stroke,7,59,Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke in a 62-Year-Old Hypertensive African-American Woman with Type-II Diabetes Mellitus  Case Report:  Introduction: This case involves a 62-year-old African-American woman  who presented with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. The demographics suggest a strong correlation between stroke incidence in African Americans with a prevalent rate of hypertension and type-II diabetes mellitus  common in this ethnic group.  Patient Information: The patient is a 62-year-old African-American woman  who is a retired teacher and lives with her husband. She has a history of hypertension for 15 years and type-II diabetes mellitus for 7 years. She is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease - her father had a myocardial infarction and her older brother  a stroke. Her BMI of 31 which classifies her as obese.  Presenting Concerns: The patient was brought to the ER by her husband when she suddenly developed slurred speech  right-sided weakness and facial droop after waking up from a nap. No seizures  fever or history of trauma was reported.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient had impaired orientation  partial motor aphasia  right-sided hemiparesis  homonymous hemianopia  and right-sided facial droop. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale was assessed at 12. Blood pressure was measured at 194/110 mmHg  and blood glucose level was elevated at 237 mg/dL. Heart rhythm was irregularly irregular  suggestive of atrial fibrillation.  Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent non-contrast CT scan of the brain showed an early infarction in the distribution of left middle cerebral artery. The patient’s laboratory results showed elevated HbA1c levels at 9.2%  LDL cholesterol of 155 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was not a thrombolysis candidate  as she presented to the hospital beyond the therapeutic window of 4.5 hours. She was started on IV fluids to maintain hydration  insulin for hyperglycemia control  and intravenous Antihypertensive medication to lower blood pressure. She was also started on anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.  Follow-up and Outcome: After admission to the stroke unit  the patient’s condition improved slightly over the next three days but showed significant functional impairment. She was transferred to the rehabilitation department and provided with aggressive physiotherapy  occupational therapy  and speech therapy. Upon discharge after four weeks  she showed remarkable improvements  with only minimal facial droop and slightly slurred speech remaining.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude for the care she received  she was made aware of the importance of medication adherence  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups to help control her caridiometabolic risk factors and prevent another stroke.  Conclusion: This case illustrates that hypertension and type-II diabetes mellitus not well controlled  are significant risk factors for stroke  particularly in African-American women. It underlines the importance of primary prevention strategies  like adequate control of hypertension and diabetes  to reduce stroke incidence in at-risk populations.

Stroke,7,62,Title: Atherosclerotic Stroke Secondary to Uncontrolled Hypertension in a 63-Year-Old African-American Male  Introduction: We present the case of a 63-year-old African-American male with hypertension who had a stroke secondary to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. This case calls for an immediate examination in the management of hypertension  a common preventable risk factor for atherosclerotic stroke in an elder age group within the African-American population.  Case Report: Mr. J  a 63-year-old African-American male with a ten-year history of poorly controlled hypertension  was brought into the emergency department (ED) with complaints of sudden-onset left-sided weakness and aphasia  which had started an hour before presentation. His past medical history was significant for hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and a 20 pack-year smoking history. He had a family history of hypertension  and both his parents had passed away due to complications from stroke.  Upon arrival  his vital signs were stable  blood pressure measuring 180/110 mmHg  pulse rate 92 beats per minute  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and temperature 98.6 °F. Neurological examination revealed a patently conscious man with left-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia. A National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 21 was recorded.  Immediate brain CT scan excluded intracranial hemorrhage and revealed a right middle cerebral artery territory ischemic infarct. His initial blood tests showed an elevated blood glucose level of 190 mg/dl and a normal coagulation profile. Urinalysis revealed traces of protein  but no glucose  ketones  bilirubin  or nitrites. His electrocardiogram (EKG) was unremarkable apart from left ventricular hypertrophy.  Management of stroke initiated with thrombolysis; however  given the poor hypertension control and ongoing smoking habit  a referral was also made to a stroke neurologist and an endocrinologist to optimize diabetes control. Antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy were concurrently adjusted.  The patient was transferred to the stroke unit where his blood pressure and blood sugar were monitored closely. He went through multiple sessions of physical  occupational  and speech therapy. After two weeks  with frequent medication adjustments  the blood pressure was better controlled. His symptoms improved gradually  and NIHSS dropped to 12 at discharge.  Discussion: This case highlights the significant role of uncontrolled hypertension in the development of atherosclerotic strokes among elderly African-American men. It is salient in showing that stroke secondary to hypertension is potentially avoidable with better management of blood pressure and population-based interventions aimed at lifestyle modification.  Conclusion: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability. Uncontrolled hypertension  a modifiable risk factor  represented in this case of an African-American male  is the most potent risk factor for stroke. A community-based approach for early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension could be key to reducing stroke incidence in this high-risk population.

Stroke,7,73,Title: An Exceptional Case of Ischemic Stroke in an Unusually Young Male Patient with Undetermined Past Medical History   Patient Profile:   Mr. X  a 35-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. His occupation includes working as an IT professional  currently residing in Chicago  Illinois  USA. He is a non-smoker and does not have any known chronic alcohol intake. His family history was vague due to estrangement but there was no reported stroke or other major genetic conditions to his knowledge.   Clinical Presentation & Diagnosis:  On December 12  2021  Mr. X woke up experiencing significant trouble in moving his right arm and leg. His speech was slurred and he also reported a sudden severe headache. He was brought by a family member to the emergency room within 2 hours of symptom onset.  Upon admission  an immediate neurological examination demonstrated a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 18  revealing profound hemiparesis on right side  facial palsy  dysarthria and mild neglect. Patient had no other significant neurological deficits observed.  A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed a large area of poor perfusion in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory on the left side. Further investigation with CT angiography confirmed thrombotic occlusion of the proximal part of the left MCA  leading to the diagnosis of an acute left MCA ischemic stroke.  Treatment & Outcome:   Administration of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) was initiated within 3 hours of symptom onset. Subsequent mechanical thrombectomy following rtPA was also performed as per the current guidelines for large vessel occlusion.   Post-intervention  the patient showed significant improvement in symptoms and a repeat NIHSS score was 4. He was then transferred to the stroke unit for further care. His stay at the hospital was complicated by pneumonia  which was managed with antibiotics. Rehabilitation and secondary stroke prevention measures were adopted after discharge.  Discussion:  This case represents an unusual scenario of acute ischemic stroke manifesting in an otherwise healthy  young adult male with no prior known history of predisposing vascular risk factors. African-Americans have been reported in literature to have higher stroke occurrences because of a higher prevalence of conditions like hypertension and diabetes. However  our patient did not have any of these conditions but still experienced an ischemic stroke.   Further testing revealed that the patient had multiple silent lacunar infarcts  previously had unknown hyperhomocysteinemia and carried the factor V Leiden mutation  suggesting a propensity towards hypercoagulability. These may be significant contributing factors to the patient's stroke episode  demonstrating the importance of detailed medical and genetic evaluation in younger patients with stroke.   This case emphasizes that stroke  which is traditionally considered a disease of the elderly  can occur in younger individuals as well and lays stress on the need for increased awareness and intervention in the younger population for stroke risk factors and possible genetic conditions leading to strokes.

Stroke,7,85,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. B (to maintain confidentiality) Age: 69 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: African-American  Residential Status: Lives independently  Presenting History:   Mrs. B visited to the emergency department of our hospital with a complaint of severe headache  slurred speech  confusion  and sudden numbness on the right side of her body. The symptoms began two hours prior to admission. Her initial blood pressure (BP) on arrival was 190/105 mmHg. Mrs. B also reported having blurry vision and slight difficulty in maintaining balance.  Past Medical History:  Prior to the occurrence of these symptoms  the patient was independent in all activities of daily living (ADLs). She was diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type 2  approximately ten years ago. She has been using her medications as prescribed for these conditions; however  compliance has periodically been poor.   Mrs. B was a smoker for about 20 years  having quit approximately five years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally  once or twice a month  with no history of illicit drug use. The family history reveals that her father had a stroke at age 75 and her mother lived into her 90s with no significant health issues.   Examination:  On neurological examination  Mrs. B displayed motor strength of grade 2/5 on the right side of her body  both upper and lower limb. Sensations were diminished in the same areas as well  and she had right-facial droop. No signs of cranial nerve palsies were present on examination. Her coordination and gait could not be evaluated due to her motor weakness. Pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally.   Investigations:  A head CT was immediately ordered which showed an occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery and signs of an early ischemic stroke. An ECG done suggested left ventricular hypertrophy. Laboratory tests revealed elevated blood glucose levels and high cholesterol.   Management & Follow-up:  After securing the airway  oxygen supplementation was initiated. Intravenous thrombolysis was performed within 3 hours of symptom onset as recommended by American Stroke Association guidelines for ischemic stroke. Antihypertensive medication was administered to bring her blood pressure under control.  Telephonic follow-up a week later with the patient's primary care physician revealed that Mrs. B was getting rehabilitation at a local skilled nursing facility and was improving.  Conclusion:  This case is notable as it highlights some of the critical risk factors for stroke such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  advanced age  race and history of smoking. There is a need for more vigorous control of these risk factors to prevent the occurrence of stroke in high-risk groups. Regular follow-up and reinforcement of the importance of medication compliance is crucial in managing these risk factors.
Stroke,7,86,"Case Report: Ischemic Stroke  Patient Information  Mr. B.P.  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  residing in suburban Massachusetts  was presented at the emergency department of our hospital for sudden onset of right-sided weakness and speech impairment. He is a retired teacher  married  and has two adult children. He is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption. He has a past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension.   Clinical History and Examination   Mr. B.P. clarified waking up at about 7 AM with a sense of his right arm and leg feeling """"heavy"""". He also noticed that he was slurring his speech. He immediately reported these symptoms to his wife  who called for an ambulance at 7:15 AM. By the time they arrived at the hospital  an hour had passed since the onset of symptoms.   Initial examination showed that he was conscious  oriented  and cooperative. His blood pressure was elevated at 160/90mmHg  and his resting heart rate was 85beats/min. He had expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis  with a strength of 3/5 in both his right upper and lower extremities assessed using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength. His gait could not be assessed due to his incapacity to move without assistance. He had a left-sided gaze preference and no sensory deficit.   Investigations and Workup   An immediate CT scan was performed that indicated no signs of intracranial hemorrhage. His ECG and cardiac enzymes were normal  ruling out acute myocardial infarction. However  echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood workup revealed an increased HbA1c of 9.5% and random blood sugar was 240 mg/dL  indicating poor control of his diabetes.   Stroke team felt this was a case of acute ischemic stroke  and as the timeline from the onset of symptoms was still within the window period for thrombolysis  he was given intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA). Meanwhile  his treatment for diabetes and hypertension was also reviewed and treated accordingly.  Outcome and Follow Up   His symptoms started improving within 24 hours of thrombolysis treatment. By the third day  his speech got better and his right-sided weakness decreased significantly (4/5 on MRC scale). He was discharged on the 7th day with the advice to continue his anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications. He was also started on a statin and antiplatelet therapy.   He was set up for outpatient physical therapy for right-sided weakness and speech therapy for residual expressive aphasia. A 3-month follow-up with the neurology team was scheduled and regular follow ups with his primary care physician for management of diabetes and hypertension were advised.    The patient's demographic information  medical history  presentation  diagnosis  treatment  and follow up are indicative and in accordance with the common presentation of ischemic stroke in the elderly population.  Learning Points:  This case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing the symptoms of stroke early and initiating the appropriate management in the 'golden hour'. It also highlights the significant role of good control of diabetes and hypertension in preventing such severe neurological complications."

She is a non-smoker  non-drinker  and has a family history of stroke.  Medical History:  The patient has a ten-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago. She has been on oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin) and antihypertensives (Lisinopril)  but compliance was wavering due to socioeconomic barriers including medication costs. She was not under any antiplatelet therapy before the stroke. There were no previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient was brought to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking that had started 3 hours prior. She had no preceding headaches  seizures  or loss of consciousness. No previous such events were reported in the past by the patient or the family.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  she appeared distress but was conscious and oriented. Her BP was 180/90 mmHg  pulse 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  Neurological examination revealed an expressive aphasia  left-sided hemiparesis  and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12 indicating a moderate stroke.   Diagnosis:  An immediate CT scan of the head was performed showing a right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. The patient’s blood glucose was elevated (223mg/dl)  and other lab findings showed poor glycemic control (HbA1c of 9.1%). Lipid profile was also abnormal with LDL cholesterol 136 mg/dL. The EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient was diagnosed with Acute Ischemic Stroke  Hypertension  and Diabetes Mellitus based on the clinical presentations  imaging  and laboratory findings.  Therapeutic Intervention:  As the patient presented within the therapeutic window for intravenous thrombolysis  she was administered recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Her hypertension was treated with intravenous antihypertensive medications.   Patient was transferred to the stroke unit for close monitoring and further management.  Follow up:  Her left-sided hemiparesis and aphasia improved gradually over subsequent weeks with physical therapy and rehabilitation. Her antihypertensive therapy was optimized  and she was also started on a statin and antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin). Diabetes management included optimizing oral agents and incorporating a dietitian-assisted meal plan. She was enrolled in a program for medication financial assistance to ensure future medication adherence.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of adequate control of risk factors such as hypertension  and diabetes in preventing ischemic stroke.

There was no significant family history of stroke  heart diseases  diabetes nor any other serious chronic illness. His last routine health check-up was two years ago  and documentation showed a blood pressure measurement of 159/95 mmHg.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department presenting with acute onset of severe headache  left-sided weakness and difficulty in speech that lasted for approximately 2 hours. Visual disturbances  loss of balance  difficulty in swallowing or a change in mental status were not reported.   Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared conscious but anxious. Vitals were recorded as - Blood Pressure: 188/110 mmHg  Pulse: 92 beats/minute  irregular and Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths/minute. Neurology exam revealed left hemiparesis with reduced power (3/5)  hyporeflexia  and impaired fine motor skills. He also had dysarthria and left-sided facial droop.   Investigations: Initial lab investigations showed a slightly elevated blood glucose and a normal lipid profile. An emergent CT scan of the head was performed and revealed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation while the Echo showed no clot in the heart.  Diagnosis and Treatment: An ischemic stroke was diagnosed based on the clinical findings and imaging studies. The patient was deemed ineligible for thrombolytic therapy because he presented after the therapeutic window for tPA administration. Antiplatelet therapy was initiated with Aspirin  along with statin therapy. He was also started on anticoagulation to manage atrial fibrillation. The hypertensive crisis was managed with intravenous antihypertensives.  Outcomes and Follow-up: The patient was hospitalized for ten days and showed slow but steady improvement with physiotherapy and rehabilitation services. His blood pressure was well controlled with antihypertensives. He was discharged with prescriptions for antihypertensive  antiplatelet  and anticoagulation medications. He was also advised regular exercise  diet control and quitting alcohol. Regular follow-ups were scheduled before his discharge.  This case highlights the importance of effective blood pressure control and medication compliance in halting the progression of systemic diseases  thereby reducing the risk of life-threatening consequences such as a stroke.
Stroke,7,92,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke in 62-Year Old Male Patient   Patient Information:  A 62-year-old Caucasian male presented at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset right-side weakness and slurred speech for about one hour. The patient was independent in activities of daily living  obese with a BMI of 30  was a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years and both have been fairly well controlled with medications.

Stroke,7,95,Title: Ischemic Stroke in a Hypertensive and Diabetic Elderly Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Stroke is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with ischemic stroke accounting for about 87% of all cases. It is highly prevalent in individuals with hypertension and diabetes mellitus  which are recognized primary risk factors.  Case Report: Patient Information: Mrs. S.  a 73-year-old Caucasian female from the Midwest United States  presented at our hospital emergency room with complaints of acute onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech. She lived alone and was brought in by a neighbor who found her in the distressed state. The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years and has been taking oral anti-hypertensives (Lisinopril) and anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin). She has no history of smoking or alcohol use.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient was conscious but appeared anxious. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scored 12  reflecting a moderate severity stroke. Blood pressure was significantly elevated at 190/110 mmHg. Blood glucose level was 267 mg/dl  above the patient's usual controlled levels. Other clinical examinations included left hemiparesis and dysarthria. No other significant abnormal findings were noted.  Diagnostic Assessment: CT scan of the brain revealed an acute ischemic infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory. No hemorrhagic transformation was noted. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm.

Stroke,7,96,"Title: Case Report on a 62-Year-Old Female Patient Presenting with Ischemic Stroke Symptoms  Patient Details:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female  who resides in an assisted living facility in Minneapolis  Minnesota. She weighs 155 lbs. and is 5'2"""" tall. She is a retired school teacher and recently widowed.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been actively managed for over ten years. Her hypertension treatment includes daily administration of 5mg Amlodipine and 50mg Losartan  while her diabetes is controlled by diet restrictions and daily 1000mg Metformin. Aside from these conditions  she has been otherwise healthy and has never smoked or consumed alcohol substantially.   Current Presentation:  The patient was brought to the emergency department following symptoms of sudden onset difficulty in speaking and drooping of the right side of her face. Her family members who were present during the episode reported that the symptoms appeared suddenly  approximately an hour before her arrival at the hospital. On arrival  the patient was conscious but displayed confusion and slurred speech. She displayed motor deficits on the right side of her body.  Clinical Investigations:  Upon physical examination  the score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was found to be 10  which is indicative of moderate severity. The patient’s other vital signs on admission were: blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg  heart rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation level of 96% on room air. Her lab results indicated blood glucose level of 198mg/dl and her platelet count  complete blood count  renal function  liver function  and electrolytes panel were within normal limits.  An emergent CT scan of the brain was performed which showed a left hemispherical middle cerebral artery territory infarct. No hemorrhage or mass effect was detected. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  performed on the following day  confirmed these findings. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and 2D Echocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no evidence of embolic sources.   Management and Outcome:  Based on the clinical history  physical examination  and imaging findings  an ischemic stroke diagnosis was confirmed. The patient was ineligible for thrombolytic therapy due to the unclear time of symptom onset. She was given daily 75mg of Clopidogrel as secondary prevention for stroke and also started on 20mg Atorvastatin for cholesterol control. She was further referred to a physiotherapist and a speech/language therapist for management of right-sided hemiplegia and dysarthria. After a hospital stay of 12 days  her symptoms had slightly improved  and she was discharged with a continued care plan.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the clinical presentation  diagnosis  management  and outcome of a senior patient with a moderate ischemic stroke. It underscores the importance of prompt detection and management of risk factors  particularly in patients with a known history of hypertension and diabetes."
Stroke,7,97,Patient Information:  Mr. James  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset of speech difficulty and drooping on the left side of his face. The patient also reported feeling a weakness on the left side of his body. He was transported to the hospital by his wife who found him in a distressed state at their home. The patient is a retired mechanical engineer  married with 3 adult children  and resides in the rural outskirts of South Carolina. He is a lifetime non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He denies any illicit drug use.   Past medical history reveals that Mr. James was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been taking medication (Losartan 50 mg daily  and Atorvastatin 20 mg daily) for the past 10 years. He has been attending annual medical check-ups regularly and has been generally compliant with his medications.   Family medical history is significant with both his parents having suffered from strokes in their late 60s. His elder brother has hypertension and his younger sister has diabetes mellitus.  In the emergency room  his vital signs on presentation were: BP: 174/92 mm Hg  PR: 86/min  RR: 16/min  Temp: 98.4°F  Oxygen saturation: 96% (on room air).  On physical examination  he was found to have slurred speech  left-sided facial droop  and substantial left-sided body weakness which was more pronounced in the arm than the leg (power 2/5 and 3/5 respectively). The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  His NIH Stroke Scale score was calculated as 12. Immediate non-contrast CT brain was performed which revealed early signs suggestive of an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory.  An urgent neurologist review was requested  and the patient was administered Alteplase (a tissue plasminogen activator) within the recommended therapeutic window for acute ischemic stroke. He was then shifted to the neuro-intensive care unit for close monitoring.  The patient's case emphasizes the importance of managing modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia promptly and adequately. Despite the patient's compliance with his medications  it might be postulated that the familial predisposition could have contributed to his stroke. This highlights the necessity of individualized patient treatment plans  factoring in genetic predispositions along with environmental and lifestyle factors.   This report also provides a practical example of the importance of rapid response systems in early stroke identification and administration of reperfusion therapies  which can significantly improve patient outcomes.
Stroke,7,98,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Doe Age: 68 Gender: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired from work as a Postal Worker Insurance Status: Medicare  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty with speech  which started approximately two and a half hours prior to presentation. He also reported experiencing a severe headache. He was immediately triaged and evaluated due to suspicion of an acute stroke.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. He also reports occasional alcohol consumption but denies any use of tobacco or illicit drugs. His father had died from stroke while relatively young  aged 70.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. Doe had a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg and a blood glucose level of 240 mg/dL. Neurologic examination demonstrated left-sided hemiplegia  left-sided hypesthesia  and mild aphasia. A review of other systems revealed no other significant findings.   Imaging Studies:  A noncontrast CT scan of the brain completed within an hour of arrival revealed a hyperdense cerebral artery sign in the right middle cerebral artery  highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke.  Treatment and Progress:  Mr. Doe was immediately started on aspirin and intravenous rehydration. The decision to commence thrombolytic therapy was made swiftly. After consultation with a neurologist  Mr. Doe was administered intravenous recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the three-hour window from symptom onset. Control of his blood glucose and blood pressure was achieved through continuous monitoring and medication adjustment.   In the days following treatment  Mr. Doe showed some improvement with residual mild left-sided weakness and speech difficulties. A multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurologist  a physiotherapist  a speech therapist  and a dietician were consulted to monitor his progress and work on rehabilitation strategies.   Discussion:  Mr. Doe's case highlights the critical role of rapid evaluation  diagnosis  and management of ischemic stroke to minimize potential disability. It is important to note that African-Americans are at a higher risk for stroke than other racial groups  and this risk is even more prominent for men. Other predisposing factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and family history were present in this case.  In conclusion  timely delivery of thrombolytic therapy remains crucial for the management of acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore  control of underlying predisposing conditions and prompt rehabilitation measures can greatly affect the prognosis and quality of life in stroke survivors.
Stroke,7,99,Title: A Case of Ischemic Stroke in a 65-Year-Old African American Male with Hypertension History  Introduction:  This case report involves a 65-year-old African American male patient with a past medical history significant for hypertension and tobacco use. The African American population has been found to have a higher risk of stroke compared to white counterparts according to various research  and this case underlines the importance of focused intervention strategies for this demographic.  Case Presentation:  Mr. J  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided body weakness accompanied by slurred speech. Further examination revealed left-sided facial droop. Symptoms started approximately 2 hours before his arrival to the hospital. His past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which he has been on a regimen of Lisinopril 20mg daily. He admitted to being a smoker with a 20-year history of tobacco use  but denies alcohol and illicit drug use. There was no relevant family history of stroke.  Clinical Findings  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  On physical examination  Mr. J’s blood pressure was considerably high at 170/90 mmHg; his heart rate was regular at 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute and his temperature at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. His BMI was 27.1. Neurological examination showed left hemiparesis and dull left-sided reflexes. His speech appeared slightly slurred but he was alert and oriented to person  time and place.  A CT scan was immediately performed which revealed no evidence of hemorrhage  but a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct was suspected due to clinical presentation. A follow-up MRI confirmed the diagnosis of a right MCA stroke.  Therapy  Outcome and follow up:  The time of onset to hospital arrival exceeded the window for thrombolytic therapy with tPA. As a result  he was admitted to the stroke unit for acute management including blood pressure control  secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy and statin  and regular physiotherapy. His hypertension was managed with Amlodipine 5mg and Lisinopril was continued. Atorvastatin 40 mg was initiated for secondary prevention  given the ischemic nature of the stroke. He was also strongly advised to cease tobacco use. At discharge  he showed slight improvements in his left-side weakness and speech.  Long term follow-up will be with a stroke team and his primary care physician. An extensive rehabilitation plan involving physiotherapy and speech therapy over the course of several weeks to months was outlined  along with recurrent assessments to control hypertension and manage stroke risk factors.  Discussion:   A stronger understanding of the higher stroke risk within the African American population might assist in improved care and interventions. Culturally competent strategies could help reach more individuals in the community  giving people advice about alterations in lifestyle habits  diet  exercise  and the importance of medication compliance in preventing future strokes.     Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of the timely diagnosis and management of hypertension  especially in high-risk populations. It also highlights the need for socio-demographically tailored strategies for stroke prevention. 
Stroke,7,100,Patient Profile: Name: Juan Miguel Delgado Age: 65 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired civil engineer Living Situation: Lives with his wife Location: San Antonio  Texas  USA  Case Presentation:  Mr. Delgado  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset right-sided weakness  aphasia  and difficulty walking which started approximately two hours prior to admission. Mr. Delgado admitted to experiencing this for the first time and was brought to the hospital by his spouse.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Delgado’s past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He quit smoking 10 years ago following a 20-year history of a half-pack of cigarettes per day. He reports occasional alcohol consumption. He also had a transient ischemic attack two years ago  for which he is on aspirin (81mg daily). There is no known history of illicit drug use  prior strokes  heart disease  or kidney disease. His family history is notable for his father having had a stroke at the age of 75.  Clinical Examinations and Diagnostic Tests:  Upon physical examination  Mr. Delgado exhibited severe aphasia  right facial droop  and right-sided hemiparesis. Initial laboratory tests were within normal ranges except for elevated blood glucose (190 mg/dl) and HbA1c (7.8%). Blood pressure on admission was 180/105 mmHg. Cholesterol levels were borderline high with LDL at 140 mg/dl and HDL at 35 mg/dl.  An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan of his brain revealed left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct. An electrocardiogram (EKG) illustrated normal sinus rhythm without any significant findings. A carotid ultrasound showed a 50% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery. The left internal carotid artery was clear of any blockage.  Final Diagnosis and Treatment:  Based on his symptoms  physical examination  and imaging results  Mr. Delgado was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. Given his presentation within the thrombolytic therapy window  he was given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Post-treatment  he was admitted to the Stroke Unit for monitoring and further management.  Subsequent Management:  General management included blood pressure control  blood sugar control  cholesterol-lowering medication  and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). His regimen included diet modification  physical and occupational rehabilitation  and speech therapy.   Take Home Points:  This case highlights that acute ischemic stroke treatment necessitates swift identification and appropriate management. It also underscores the importance of strict hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes management in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) to help prevent subsequent strokes. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  moderate alcohol consumption and healthy diet should also be emphasized.

Stroke,9,1,Case Presentation  Patient Demographics: Mr. Thompson is a 65-year-old African-American male  retired  married  and father of three adult children. Compute networks indicated that middle-aged African-American men have a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke. Mr. Thompson resides in an urban community where studies have shown high rates of stroke.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a ten-year history of hypertension  which is the leading cause of stroke worldwide. Despite being diagnosed  he was inconsistent with his medications due to cost and difficulty adhering to the medication schedule. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle and is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago. Mr. Thompson is otherwise healthy  with no previous history of diabetes  heart disease  obesity  or blood disorders.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thompson was presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and associated facial droop.  Family History: His father experienced a stroke at age 72  which is consistent with studies indicating familial clustering of stroke events. However  the rest of the immediate family is generally healthy with no medical history of a similar presentation.   Examination and Investigations: On examination  Mr. Thompson demonstrated a reduced power of 3/5 in the left upper and lower limbs  dysarthria  and left-sided facial droop suggesting an acute right hemispheric stroke. Full blood counts  blood sugar level  cholesterol  and coagulation profile were ordered. A CT scan revealed an ischemic infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory.  Discussion: The case endorses multiple stroke risk factors with the most significant being a history of non-compliance with hypertensive mediation  a sedentary lifestyle  previous smoking  and familial predisposition. Despite the cessation of smoking  the risk of stroke remains steady as older age is a major non-modifiable risk factor.  This case presents a common demographic where African-Americans were found to have increased stroke prevalence. Health planning should account for effective communication and intervention methods tailored to this demographic. Programmes that assist in reducing the cost of medications  encouraging regular physical activity  focused health education may contribute to improved medication compliance and might have prevented Mr. Thompson's stroke.  Plan: Given the patient's recent stroke  an interdisciplinary team approach to managing Mr. Thompson's recovery will be put in place. This will include input from physicians  rehabilitation therapists  dietitians  and social workers to support both Mr. Thompson and his family comprehensively during the recovery period  this will also include follow-up management of his hypertension.
Stroke,9,2,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe is a 65-year-old African American male with a diagnosis of a recent ischemic stroke.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which have remained moderately controlled over the last 10 years. He quit smoking 5 years ago  after a 30-year habit of one pack a day  but his diet remains high in fats and sodium. There is no previous history of infectious or cardiovascular diseases. He was on regular medication for his diabetes and hypertension including Metformin (1000mg/day) and Lisinopril (10mg/day).  Demographics: Mr. Doe is retired and lives with his wife in an urban area. He is not very active and has a BMI classified as obese. He completed high school but no further education. He receives Medicare for his health coverage.  Family History: His family history is significant as his father died at an early age of 60 due to a stroke  and his mother  aged 79  is alive with a history of hypertension and diabetes. His only sibling  an older brother  aged 68  has a history of heart disease.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe presented with symptoms of severe headache  trouble walking  slurred speech  and numbness on the right side of his body. His wife reports these symptoms appeared suddenly this morning.   Physical Examination: Mr. Doe is afebrile  but his blood pressure is elevated (170/95 mmHg) when measured in the ER. Neurological examination revealed a right-sided facial droop  motor deficits in the right upper and lower extremities  mild dysarthria  but no noted cognitive or sensory deficits.  Investigations: His CT scan showed no hemorrhage but an MRI showed an ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Other blood tests indicated poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c 8.0%) and lipids are moderately elevated.  Management: Mr. Doe was immediately given aspirin to prevent clotting and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration initiated. Long-term  he will need tighter control of his blood pressure and diabetes  and modification of his diet and physical activity levels.  Discussion: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  with higher rates in African American individuals than in white individuals. Risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  smoking  obesity  diet  and a sedentary lifestyle are of concern  as are genetic and familial risks. Prompt treatment is key to minimizing damage and enhancing recovery. Encouraging lifestyle modification and strict control of blood pressure and diabetes reduces the risk of recurrent stroke.   In Mr. Doe's case  his demographic and lifestyle factors  combined with his family history  likely contributed to his stroke event. His case highlights the importance of addressing these factors proactively in at-risk populations  for prevention and management of stroke.
Stroke,9,3,Patient Profile:  Mr. Ortiz  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  experienced sudden weakness on his left side this morning. He was ambulating normally at home when this occurred. His wife noticed slurred speech and facial droop  and immediately called EMS.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Ortiz has a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  Type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia  for which he is not compliant with his medications due to his purported lack of symptoms. He has a 20 pack-year smoking history  though he quit 15 years ago. Besides these  he denies a history of any other major illness or surgeries in the past.  Demographics:  Mr. Ortiz is retired and lives with his wife. He used to work as a janitor in a local school. He completed high school education and does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was born and raised in the United States.  Family History:  His father died from complications of a stroke at 78 and his mother had Type II diabetes and died from myocardial infarction at 81. His older brother  70 years old  is currently managing Type II diabetes  and his 65-year-old sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  Presenting Complaints and Examination Findings:  Mr. Ortiz was conscious but noticeably distressed upon arrival. He presented with dysarthria  left facial droop  and weakness in the left upper and lower limbs. His blood pressure was elevated at 190/100mmHg. Other vital signs were within normal limits. A detailed neurological examination revealed a significant decrease in motor power (3/5) on the left side of the body.  Investigations:  An urgent CT scan showed an occlusive thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery with non-contrast enhancing ischemic brain tissue  confirming an acute ischemic stroke.  Management:  Given the patient’s presentation and CT scan findings  he was a candidate for thrombolysis. After discussing the potential risks and benefits with his wife  intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered within the therapeutic window. He was further started on aspirin  lipid-lowering therapy  and measures to control his blood pressure and blood glucose levels.  Follow-up and Prognosis:  Mr. Ortiz has been referred to physical and occupational therapy. His prognosis will depend on his adherence to the medication regimen  control of modifiable risk factors  and response to rehabilitation. His family history of stroke and personal history of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes puts him at high risk  emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring and intervention.   Patient Education:  Mr. Ortiz and his wife have been counseled on the importance of medication adherence  lifestyle modification  regular follow-ups  and early recognition of stroke symptoms. A referral for a smoking cessation program and dietary consultation has also been made.
Stroke,9,4,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke within the left middle cerebral artery territory. He resides in an urban  low-income area and worked as a taxi driver prior to his retirement.   Past Medical History:  He has a history of poorly controlled type-2 diabetes  hypertension  transient ischemic attacks (TIA)  hyperlipidemia  and stage-3 chronic kidney disease. He has been prescribed medication including metformin  Atorvastatin  and Lisinopril but compliance has been haphazard due to financial constraints.   Family History:  Both his parents died of cardiovascular-related events in their early 70s. His only sibling  a younger brother  suffered from a stroke at the age of 63. A genogram elicited a significant history of stroke on both paternal and maternal sides of his family. There’s also a common thread of hypertension and type-2 diabetes within the family.  Social History:  He is a current smoker with a 30-pack year history of smoking. He consumes alcohol occasionally. He lives with his wife and has a history of irregular follow-ups with his GP due to financial constraints and transportation issues.  Presentation:  He was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after being found by his wife  experiencing difficulty speaking and right-sided weakness. On examination  he had a blood pressure of 185/95  heart rate of 90 bpm  and random blood sugar of 280 mg/dL. His National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12  indicating a moderate severity stroke. An immediate Computed Tomography (CT) confirmed ischemic stroke with no signs of hemorrhage.  Assessment:  Based on the NIHSS score  the clinical presentation  and CT results  the patient was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. The cause of the stroke is thought to be multifactorial  relating to poorly managed hypertension  diabetes  history of smoking  and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient’s low socioeconomic status and unplanned medication non-adherence act as additional risk factors.   Plan:  The patient was given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the appropriate time window following stroke symptom onset. He was admitted to the Stroke Unit for closer monitoring and he was also started on secondary prevention measures including an antiplatelet (Aspirin)  a statin (Atorvastatin)  and an antihypertensive (Lisinopril). His glycaemic control was also addressed with Insulin initiation. He was counseled about the importance of lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  regular monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugar levels  and adherence to medications. In consultation with a social worker  plans were made to facilitate affordable medications and regular follow-up appointments. An appointment with physical therapy and occupational therapy was scheduled to assist with right-sided weakness and improve functionality.   This case emphasises the burden of stroke among African American males and the influence of socioeconomic status  highlighting the need to address health inequities in stroke prevention and care.
Stroke,9,5,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information:  Patient Initials: E.D.  Age: 58  Sex: M  Race: African American  Occupation: Taxi Driver  Presenting Issue:  E.D. presents with symptoms indicative of a stroke. He reported sudden difficulty in speaking and understanding speech  weakness  numbness of the face and limbs  one side of the body specifically. He has a significant headache that started abruptly  including trouble with vision  dizziness  and loss of balance.   Past Medical History:  E.D. has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is prescribed antihypertensive medication and statins but admits to occasionally missing doses due to his irregular work shifts. He has a 18 pack-year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. He does not restrict salt or fats from his diet  significantly. His BMI stood at 29 indicating overweight  leading towards obesity.  Family History:  He has a family history of stroke  with his father having suffered a major stroke at age 65  leading to mortality. His mother was a hypertensive  and his only sibling elder brother  is also a known hypertensive and diabetic but has no history of stroke. No immediate relatives had documented heart disease.  Clinical Findings:  Upon neurological examination  E.D. demonstrated facial droop on his right side  slurred speech  and right side body weakness. His blood pressure was recorded as 180/110 mmHg  notably above normal. His total cholesterol count was also marginally high than normal.  Diagnosis:  Based on the presentation  history  and clinical examination results  E.D. was diagnosed with ischemic stroke. MRI imaging confirmed it.  Treatment Plan:  He was administered intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) under the given time window for its application  considering the direct correlation between faster treatment times and better recovery rates post-stroke. Secondary prevention will include strict adherence to his antihypertensive and cholesterol medications  healthy low-sodium  low-fat diet and incorporating regular physical activity.  Plan for Follow-up:  E.D. will be referred to physical and occupational therapy to manage his post-stroke symptoms and improve his functional capacity. He also needs to be followed-up with a dietitian for controlling dietary factors affecting his blood pressure and lipid profile. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled with his general physician and a neurologist for monitoring his medication adherence  blood pressure and lipid control  as well as any signs of stroke recurrence. Psychosocial support to handle potential stroke-associated depression/anxiety will be considered  as needed.  As a part of community/population health strategy  increased awareness regarding warning signs of stroke  the importance of prompt medical attention  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be recommended as a prevention measure based on E.D.'s case. Especially for the African American population  given higher stroke morbidity and mortality rates compared with other races. It would be important to consider the socioeconomic and cultural factors affecting an individual's health practices and access to healthcare resources.

Stroke,9,7,Patient Profile:  The patient  Mr. John  is a 68-year-old African-American male  who was brought to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of a stroke. He is a retired engineer  a widower for 5 years  and lives with his eldest daughter in Chicago. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having passed away from a fatal heart attack at the age of 71 and his elder sister died of stroke at the age of 62.  Present Illness:  Mr. John was found by his daughter  unconscious on the bathroom floor. He was immediately rushed to the hospital. Upon arrival  he was experiencing right-sided weakness and had slurred speech  indicative of a possible stroke.   Past Medical History:  Mr. John has been a known hypertensive for the last 10 years and has type II diabetes mellitus for 8 years  for both of which he takes medication regularly. He also suffers from occasional bouts of atrial fibrillation for which he takes an anticoagulant. Mr. John was a smoker for about 20 years but quit 15 years ago. He has also been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels  for which he has been taking statins.  Physical Assessment:  On evaluation  he was conscious but disoriented. His blood pressure was found to be 175/100 mm Hg  pulse 80/min  irregular  and respiratory rate was 22/min. Neurological examination showed right homonymous hemianopia and right-sided facial droop. His speech was slurred  and he had right-sided hemiparesis.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  An urgent CT scan was performed which ruled out hemorrhage and confirmed the presence of a left MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) territory infarct  confirming the stroke. His blood tests showed an elevated glucose level and lipid profile.  Treatment Plan:  The urgent treatment plan includes controlling high blood pressure  stabilizing blood glucose levels  rehydrating the patient  and initiating thrombolytic therapy. He may also need physical and occupational therapy rehabilitation to regain lost functional abilities.  Conclusion:  Mr. John has various risk factors for stroke including age  race  hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  family history  and smoking. Regular monitoring and control of his blood pressure  blood glucose level  and cholesterol level is essential to prevent the recurrence of stroke. Lifestyle modifications including diet control and physical exercise will also be beneficial.  Note:  African American men have been identified as having a high risk of stroke  with hypertension and diabetes being the most prevalent risk factors. The patient's past medical history of heart disease further increases the risk. Therefore  this case highlights the importance of regular monitoring and appropriate management of these modifiable risk factors.
Stroke,9,8,Patient Presentation  The patient is Mr. J  a 68-year-old African American male retired accountant  who lives with his wife in Atlanta  Georgia.   Chief Complaint  Mr. J was urgently admitted to the ER after he was found at his home having difficulty in speaking and drooping face on the right side. His wife  who called the ambulance  mentioned that symptoms commenced suddenly about an hour ago.   History of Present Illness  According to patient accounts  Mr. J says that he suddenly felt unsteady and noticed he was having trouble speaking. He initially brushed it off  thinking it was due stress  but alerted his wife when his face started to droop and he experienced weakness in his right arm. He denies symptoms like headache  chest pain  difficulty breathing  loss of consciousness  or any bowel or bladder issues.  Past Medical History  Mr. J is a known hypertensive for 10-years  which was poorly controlled due to difficulties with medication compliance. He had also been diagnosed with type II diabetes 5-years ago  which was managed through oral hypoglycemic agents and a modified diet. He had a previous episode of Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) 3 years ago. He does not have any history of heart disease  lung disease  kidney disease  or any surgically treated ailments.  Family History  Family history is significant in that his father suffered a stroke  and mother was a type II diabetic. His two older siblings are hypertensive.  Social History  He is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago. He admits to occasional/social alcohol use. He lives with his wife  and they have four adult children.  Physical Examination  On his physical exam  his blood pressure is elevated at 185/90 mmHg. Neurologically  he has weakness on the right side of his body  right facial droop  and slurred speech with some word-finding difficulties.  Diagnostic Results  An immediate CT head is carried out  which reveals an ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery region. His blood tests show elevated blood glucose levels and HbA1c  indicating poorly controlled diabetes.  Discussion  Mr. J  a 68-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and type II diabetes  presents with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  facial droop  and speech difficulties which is consitent with an acute stroke. His hypertensive state  age  ethnicity  genetic predisposition  and prior TIA episode  put him in the high-risk category for stroke. His poorly controlled diabetes can also be contributing to his cerebrovascular disease.  Plan of Care  The most important immediate intervention for an ischemic stroke is the prompt administration of thrombolytic therapy  if there are no contra-indications. Subsequently  Mr. J will require intensive rehabilitation. His diabetes and hypertension will need to be managed more effectively for secondary prevention. Lifestyle modifications including a low salt  low sugar diet  regular physical exercise along with cessation of alcohol should be encouraged. He will also need persistent follow-ups to monitor his response.  In conclusion  Mr. J's case represents an ischemic stroke in a patient with high-risk factors which include uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes mellitus  prior TIA episode  African American race  and a positive family history of cerebrovascular disease. This reinforces the need for meticulous management of modifiable risk factors to prevent such severe debilitating outcomes.
Stroke,9,9,Patient Presentation  Patient’s Initials: J.D.  Age: 68 years  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  J.D.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents in the emergency department after being found unresponsive in his home. According to the neighbors  they had noticed his absence in the daily routine for approximately 12 hours before they decided to check up on him.   Past Medical History:  J.D. has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which were diagnosed 15 years ago. He has been non-compliant with his antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications and follow-up appointments. J.D. is also frequently seen at the local bar  suggesting possible chronic alcohol use. There's no history of previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks. No known allergies are recorded.  Family History:  His mother had a history of stroke and his father had cardiovascular disease. His older brother  currently 71  suffers from hypertension but has not experienced a stroke.   Recent Health Behavior:  Upon further interviewing neighbors and close friends  they reveal that lately  J.D. has shown symptoms such as personality changes  difficulty walking  unsteady movements  and occasional slurred speech  but attributed them primarily to his alcohol consumption.  Clinical Presentation:  On examination  J.D. is found unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. He presents with right-sided weakness and has a blood pressure reading of 170/95 mmHg. His blood glucose level reads 215 mg/dL  well above the normal range. Neurologic findings confirm right hemiparesis and facial droop. His pupils are equal but show a sluggish response to light.   Given the clinical presentations and medical history  J.D. is immediately sent for a CT scan  which shows an occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery  indicating an ischemic stroke.  Plan:  J.D. is immediately started on intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy. He is also given antihypertensive therapy to manage his blood pressure  and hyperglycemia is treated to prevent further neuronal damage. He is closely monitored in the Stroke Care Unit with aggressive rehabilitation planned upon stabilization of his health.  Prognosis and Follow-up:  Regular follow-ups  along with strict compliance with antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications  will be crucial once J.D. is discharged. His risky behaviors  such as alcohol consumption and medication non-compliance  need to be addressed  and appropriate lifestyle modifications should be encouraged. Ongoing outpatient physical and occupational therapy will be integral to his rehabilitation. 
Stroke,9,10,Patient Profile: Our patient is a 72-year-old African American male  named Mr. Jones who lives independently at his own home in the urban area.   Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia for more than 20 years. He is a former smoker  ceasing approximately 30 years ago. He has had very minimal alcohol use. Remarkably  he presents no prior history of strokes or transient ischemic attacks.  Complete Demographics: Mr. Jones is a retired construction worker and a widower with four adult children. In terms of education  he only went through 8th grade education. He is of a lower socioeconomic status and relies on governmental medical insurance. Mr. Jones has poor English proficiency and usually consults the hospital through his bilingual (English and Amharic) daughter.  Family History: His family history reveals a paternal history of stroke and a maternal history of a heart disease. Both parents had hypertension and his two older brothers are living with diabetes and hypertension.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Jones was presented to the ER by his family with complaints of sudden onset of left-sided numbness and weakness  accompanied by a difficulty in speaking which lasted for about two hours.  Physical Findings: Upon neurological examination  he was found to have moderate left-sided weakness  expressive aphasia  and mild facial droop. MR imaging confirmed an acute ischemic stroke in the right hemisphere.  Management: Mr. Jones received the necessary timely intervention  including thrombolysis. He was then admitted to the stroke unit for further management including antithrombotic therapy  secondary prevention measures  and consideration for rehabilitative therapy given the physical findings.  Discussion: In consideration of the overall picture  it is important to note the contributing factors; Mr. Jones falls into a high-risk demographic due to his race and age. His longstanding history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and diabetes further exacerbated his risk alongside his minimal educational attainment and socioeconomic status.  This case highlights the crucial role of effective stroke education  risk factor management  and other intervention measures in preventing stroke  particularly amongst diverse populations. It also signifies the need for culturally- competent  and linguistically appropriate healthcare policies and practices in stroke prevention and treatment.   The patient's care plan should be targeted towards the management of his chronic diseases (hypertension  diabetes) and the identified stroke risk factors. It was also noted that there were social determinants coming into play - living alone  language barriers - that could impact his recovery and ongoing care. Additionally  the positive family history of stroke implies that Mr. Jones' immediate family might benefit from stroke risk education and screening for stroke risk factors.
Stroke,9,11,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Garcia  a 72-year-old Hispanic female and retired schoolteacher  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and a drooping face. Her daughter  who lives with her  noticed these symptoms around 8 am when Ms. Garcia was trying to have her breakfast  and quickly rushed her to the hospital. The patient arrived at our emergency department approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes from the onset of her symptoms.  Past Medical History: Ms. Garcia has been hypertensive for the past 15 years. She is also a type 2 diabetic for 10 years. Both conditions are managed with medication  but Ms. Garcia's adherence to her medication schedule is inconsistent. She also used to smoke one pack a day but quit 20 years ago. She has no history of heart disease  cholesterol disorders  or cancer. She underwent a hysterectomy at the age of 50.   Family History: Her mother  who died aged 82  suffered from hypertension and had a stroke in her mid-70s. Ms. Garcia's only sibling  a brother  aged 76  has recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's. Her father died in his mid-60s from complications due to chronic alcoholism.   Social and Lifestyle Factors:  Ms. Garcia lives with her daughter and her two grandkids. She is widowed. She enjoys cooking  reading and going to church. Ms. Garcia's diet is mostly traditional Mexican  heavy on tortillas and beans  and lesser on fruits and vegetables  contributing to her obesity  a BMI of 32.  Clinical Findings:  Vitals upon arrival: BP 180/95  Pulse 88  Temp 98.6  Respirations 16  Oxygen saturation 98% on room air  BMI 32. Physical exam findings were consistent with a neurological deficit on the left side with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14.   Investigations and Diagnosis:   A CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage  leading to a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The patient was immediately started on intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy  within the appropriate therapeutic window. The MRI further confirmed an acute ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory.   In the current case  the patient's age  gender  and ethnicity are typical demographics reported in stroke literature. Her pre-existing comorbidities  especially hypertension and diabetes  are well-acknowledged risk factors for a stroke. Also  her non-compliance with medications and her high-fat diet leading to obesity further increased her risk. This case re-emphasizes the importance of proper management of comorbidities  medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications in the prevention of strokes.
Stroke,9,12,Patient Case Presentation: Stroke   Patient Information:  The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male named Robert. He is a retired schoolteacher living with his wife of 50 years in the urban city of Baltimore  Maryland. He is a father of two adult children and has four grandchildren.  Presenting Complaint: Robert arrived at the hospital emergency department presenting with sudden onset of speech difficulty  weakness on the right side of his body  and difficulty walking. These symptoms were noticed by his wife who rushed him to the hospital.  Medical History: Robert has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension  a condition he has been battling for 18 years. Despite being prescribed antihypertensive medications by his primary care physician  his adherence has been inconsistent over time. Additionally  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus seven years ago which is currently being managed with oral medications. He is also struggling with obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. Robert admits to a past heavy smoking habit of 20 years  which he quit at age 50.  Family History: Robert's family history is significant. His father passed away from a massive myocardial infarction at the age of 67. His older brother  aged 75  was diagnosed with a stroke two years ago and is currently in a rehabilitation facility. Roberts's mother  now deceased  also had a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis: Upon examination  Robert displayed unilateral facial drooping and expressive aphasia. His blood pressure was significantly elevated at 170/100 mmHg. A neurological evaluation showed right-sided hemiparesis with scoring 3 out of 5. Fasting blood glucose level was high at 200 mg/dl. A brain MRI revealed an area of infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory  confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.  Summary: Robert's case is typical of the significant prevalence of stroke among African-American males over 65  related in large part to the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension within this demographic. His other risk factors  including type 2 diabetes  obesity  and family history  contributed to his current condition. Robert's case highlights the critical need for the aggressive management of modifiable risk factors for stroke  such as hypertension and diabetes  especially in high-risk populations.

Stroke,9,13,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Roger Kim  is a 65-year-old African American male residing in an urban community discovered unresponsive by his wife. Mr. Kim's family history revealed the presence of hypertension  diabetes  and stroke. Mr. Kim has a ten-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus that is controlled with medication. Recently  he has been complaining about occasional headaches. He is a non-smoker and only uses alcohol in moderation.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Roger Kim has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past ten years and is on Lisinopril 20mg daily. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus about seven years ago and has been maintaining control with Metformin 500mg twice daily and insulin add on therapy. Mr. Kim also has diagnosed hyperlipidemia and is on Simvastatin. He appears to have a messier diet and rarely exercises. There is no history of surgeries  allergies or other significant illnesses and previous consultations were unremarkable.  Social History:  Mr. Kim is retired and lives with his wife. He has two children who are both healthy. He has a 40 pack-year (a pack-year = number of packs per day x number of years smoked) history of cigarette smoking  but he quit about 15 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has no history of illicit drug use.  Family History:  His father died in his early 70s due to myocardial infarction and his mother suffered a stroke in her late 60s. MR. Kim's older brother has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is also a known familial history of hyperlipidemia.   Clinical Course and Findings:  On examination  abnormal findings were right-sided hemiparesis  speech impairment  and facial droop. An urgent CT scan revealed ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery. Mr. Kim received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and is being monitored in the stroke unit. He is continuing working with speech  physical and occupational therapists daily to regain his functionality.  Given his clinical course and history  the patient's stroke is most likely due to uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There is also a high probability that his predisposing diabetes and family history also contributed to his stroke.   Plan:  Treatment involves managing secondary preventive measures to control his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Really emphasizing lifestyle changes including adhering to a low sodium  low cholesterol diet  and increasing physical activity. He and his family are being educated about the importance of medication compliance  managing blood pressure  glucose and cholesterol levels.

Stroke,9,22,Patient Profile: A 72-year-old African American male (research indicates that African Americans are more vulnerable to strokes compared to other demographics) retired truck driver  named John Doe  was admitted to our medical facility presenting signs of acute stroke.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been under control for the past ten years with medication (metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension). Additionally  he has high cholesterol levels  managed with statins. He's a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but before quitting  he had a pack-per-day habit for 25 years. He has limited physical activities due to osteoarthritis. He does not have a history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Family History: Stroke-related illnesses run in Mr. Doe's family. His father died at the age of 74 from a stroke. Moreover  his elder brother  now 76 years old  survived a stroke two years ago. Diabetes and hypertension are other aspects noticeable in his family history.  Present Illness: John Doe presented himself to the Emergency Department with sudden numbness and weakness on the left side of his body  slurred speech  confusion  and difficulty walking that started approximately three hours prior his arrival. He also reported having a severe headache  dizziness  followed by vomiting.  On Examination: Vital signs at triage: BP 178/95 mmHg  pulse 86/min  temp 98.7 and respiratory rate of 14/min. Glasgow coma scale score - 14/15; NIH stroke scale score - 16 indicating moderate to severe stroke. On neurological assessment  presence of left hemiparesis  facial droop and dysarthria were observed.  Interventions: Mr. Doe underwent CT scan immediately which identified an ischemic stroke. An MRI was also done later to confirm the size and location of the infarct. He was given IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) considering the onset time of symptoms was within the therapeutic window of use. A neurologist and cardiologist were consulted  his blood pressure was brought under control and his other comorbidities were addressed.  Conclusion: John Doe's case illustrates the importance of managing risk factors for stroke  as well as the critical nature of prompt medical intervention when someone displays stroke symptoms. Despite his family history of stroke and personal history of several significant risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and obesity)  it appears as though Mr. Doe might have minimized or not perceived his real risk level. Consequently  concerted effort towards public education targeting recognition of stroke symptoms  particularly in at-risk populations  could lead to earlier treatment and possibly improve outcomes.

Stroke,9,25,"Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Johnson Age: 65 Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired School Teacher  History of Present Illness: Jane  an African-American female aged 65  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and facial drooping which began approximately 90 minutes prior to arriving at the hospital.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2-diabetes  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She has also been battling obesity. She has previously smoked for around 10 years but quit smoking about 15 years ago. She has no known drug allergies and is regularly monitored for her hypertension and diabetes management.  Family History: Her family history is significant for cardiac diseases and stroke. Both her parents suffered from hypertension and heart diseases. Her father died at the age of 72 due to a heart attack  and her older sister suffered from a stroke at the age of 57.   Clinical Observations: On examination  Jane was conscious but had a notable difficulty speaking. She had a BP of 170/100 mm Hg  a pulse of 80/min  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Neurological examination found Jane to have right-sided facial weakness  reduced muscular power in the right upper and lower limbs  and impaired speech.   Investigations: Stroke was suspected  and Jane was urgently taken for a computed tomography (CT) scan of her head  which confirmed the presence of an ischemic stroke on her left cerebral hemisphere.  Case Presentation: Jane  a 65-year-old African-American female with a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and a significant family history of heart diseases and stroke  presented with acute right-sided weakness  facial drooping and speech difficulty. Investigations confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The precipitating factor in this case would be her uncontrolled hypertension  family history  and previous history of smoking considering the demographic representation in the literature that states that stroke is higher in African American women  majorly due to hypertension. Her management involved immediate admission to the hospital's stroke ward  where she was started on intravenous thrombolytic therapy  began physical therapy  and was watched closely for any complications.   This case emphasizes the need for better control of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. It also highlights the importance of immediate medical attention in the outcomes of stroke treatment  knowing the phrase """"time is brain""""."

Stroke,9,28,Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male named John Thompson. John is a retired carpenter from Boise  Idaho. He lives with his wife and has four adult children and seven grandchildren. He was moderately active prior to hospitalization and participated in woodworking as a hobby. He is a former smoker  who quit 10 years ago after a 30-year habit  and a moderate drinker - one to two drinks per week.  Reason for Presenting to Hospital: John presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty talking and altered consciousness which lasted for approximately two hours. These symptoms are consistent with a stroke  as confirmed by a CT scan.  Past Medical History: John has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He also suffers from atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a moderate risk of stroke due to this condition. He also had an anterior myocardial infarction in his 50s.  Family History: John's family history is significant with his father having died at 68 due to a myocardial infarction. His paternal grandfather also had a stroke that limited his mobility later in life. From his mother's side  there is a history of diabetes and hypertension. One of his siblings  a sister  was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at 62 years old.  Medication History: At the time of presentation  his medication schedule included daily lisinopril for hypertension  simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia  and baby aspirin for atrial fibrillation.  Investigations: The initial examination revealed a score of 14 on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). His blood pressure was 165/95 mm Hg. The CT head showed a small infarct in the left middle cerebral artery. His blood work upon admission revealed increased cholesterol levels  high levels of clotting factor  and no signs of infection. Electrocardiograph (ECG) at the time of presentation confirmed his atrial fibrillation.  Hospital Course: John's stroke symptoms gradually reduced over the first 48 hours of supportive care and management. However  the stroke has left him with marked right-sided weakness and communication difficulties due to aphasia.  Plan for Discharge and Follow-Up: John was referred to a rehabilitation center to support his mobility and speech. He will also follow up with his primary care physician and a neurologist for his anticoagulant and antihypertensive management. His cholesterol medication will be reviewed and likely increased. Lifestyle modifications including a heart-healthy diet  exercise as tolerated  and stroke education were emphasized.  This case presentation represents the story of many patients diagnosed with stroke globally. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability and often leads to severe long-term impairment. Hypertension  atrial fibrillation  and hypercholesterolemia  as seen in John's case  are common risk factors associated with stroke. Therefore  this case also gives insight into secondary prevention strategies for stroke  such as control of hypertension  anticoagulation for AF  and cholesterol management.

Stroke,9,32,Patient Identification: Mrs. Maria Lopez  68 years old  Latina female  retired teacher  living in San Francisco  CA with her retired husband.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. Lopez was brought to the emergency room by her husband because she suddenly developed difficulty in speaking and weakness on her right side.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Lopez has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  diagnosed 10 years ago  which was being managed with medication (Lisinopril 10 mg once daily and Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day). She also has moderate osteoarthritis but remains physically active.  Family History: The patient’s father suffered from a heart disease and her mother had diabetes. One of her older sisters also suffered a stroke in her early 70s.   Clinical & Diagnostic Findings: Upon evaluation  Mrs. Lopez was conscious but showed slurred speech  right facial droop  and right-sided hemiparesis. The attending physician ordered a CT scan which showed an ischemic stroke in the left cerebral hemisphere.  Treatment: The patient was swiftly administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as per stroke protocol  considering her symptoms began less than three hours ago. The patient was admitted to the stroke unit for further monitoring and management.  Social History: Mrs. Lopez is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She enjoys gardening and walking in the neighborhood park. She is religious and participates in church activities regularly.  Further Discussion: Given Mrs. Lopez's age  ethnic background  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history  she is at a heightened risk for stroke. According to the literature  Hispanic women have a relatively higher risk of stroke compared to Caucasian counterparts  and the risk is significantly higher among those with cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia. The prompt management of stroke by administration of tPA and the subsequent continuous monitoring were in line with the American Stroke Association guidelines. Additional management includes physical therapy for her right hemiparesis and speech therapy  which will be integral parts of her recovery.  Education Plan: Constant monitoring and control of her existing hypertension and hyperlipidemia is mandatory to prevent another stroke. As part of her discharge planning  Mrs. Lopez will need education on understanding the signs and symptoms of stroke  the importance of continuing her medication  engaging in physical activity  maintaining a healthy diet to manage her cholesterol levels  attending her physical and speech therapy appointments  and making appropriate lifestyle changes. She may also benefit from a stroke support group.
Stroke,9,33,Case Presentation:  Patient Background:  The patient is a 69-year-old African-American male  currently residing in the urban neighborhood of North Philadelphia  PA. He is a retired construction worker  a widower  and lives with his only daughter. The patient is a lifelong smoker and seldomly exercises due to his arthritis. His diet consists of high-cholesterol foods along with a moderate intake of alcohol in the evenings. His father died from a stroke and his mother passed away from diabetes-related complications.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with classic stroke symptoms – sudden onset of left-sided weakness  confusion  and blurred vision. He denies headache  fever or any other symptoms.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Both these conditions have been managed with medication for over 10 years. The medications include Lisinopril 20mg once a day and Simvastatin 20mg before bedtime. In addition to these  he has been managing his osteoarthritis with over-the-counter pain medication.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient's blood pressure is elevated (160/100 mmHg). He is afebrile. Neurologic examination reveals left hemiparesis and left facial droop. His speech is slurred  but comprehension is intact.  Investigations:  An emergent CT scan of the head shows early signs of ischemia  suggesting that he suffered an ischemic stroke. His cholesterol levels are also found elevated.  Management:  He was administered Alteplase  a clot-busting drug after confirming the eligibility. Post thrombolysis  he is kept under observation in the stroke unit. His hypertension is managed with angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent further cerebrovascular accidents. Since he presented within the 3 hours window  he was eligible for thrombolysis  for which he provided consent.  Outcome:  The patient showed significant improvement after thrombolysis. His strength on the left side improved  and speech became clearer although the progress was slow and would require extensive physical and speech therapy. His daughter was educated about stroke  its risk factors  and lifestyle modifications required to prevent a recurrent stroke.  In conclusion  in this case  the patient's race and personal lifestyle choices such as smoking  diet  and lack of exercise  as well as his family medical history of stroke and diabetes  have likely contributed to his ischemic stroke. This case illustrates the importance of proactive management of risk factors to prevent such adverse events.
Stroke,9,34,Patient Profile: Mr. James Wilson Demographics: 65-year-old African American Male  Chief Complaint: Sudden weakness on the right side of the body  Presenting Condition:  Mr. James Wilson  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided body weakness  difficulty in speaking and a drooping face on the right side - all classic symptoms of a possible stroke.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus  both of which have been controlled with medication. He is a smoker with a 40 pack-year history and has a moderate alcohol intake. He also has a past diagnosis of atrial fibrillation  which is currently asymptomatic and has been managed with prescribed anticoagulants. In addition  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago.  Family History: Mr. Wilson's mother died from a stroke at the age of 73 and his father has a history of heart disease. His elder sibling  a 68-year-old male  was also diagnosed with a stroke two years ago.  Investigations: He underwent a head CT scan revealing an occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery  confirming an ischemic stroke. His blood pressure was also high (170/95 mm Hg). Mr. Wilson's cholesterol and blood glucose levels were also above normal ranges  consistent with his past medical history.  Treatment: He was given intravenous thrombolytic therapy within the recommended 'golden period' to help dissolve the clot  and antiplatelet drugs were initiated. His antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications were adjusted.  Discussion: Mr. Wilson’s case represents a classic stroke scenario  given his age  race  and medical history. African American males over 60 are at higher risk for stroke compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Moreover  Mr. Wilson's concurrent conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation pose additional risk factors for stroke. His smoking habit and alcohol consumption further increase his vulnerability. Finally  his family history of stroke and heart disease also puts him at a genetically higher predisposition. Effective management of his health conditions and lifestyle modifications could reduce his risk of recurrent strokes. A multi-disciplinary approach involving a neurologist  cardiologist  endocrinologist  and a counselor for life style changes is advised for optimal outcome.
Stroke,9,35,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulties that had persisted for approximately three hours prior to arrival.   Past Medical history:   Mr. Rodriguez is known to have uncontrolled hypertension  for which he had been erratic in consuming prescribed antihypertensives due to financial difficulties. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with oral medications  and a 20-year history of pack-a-day smoking (currently a smoker). He denies any history of heart disease but admits to having a generally unhealthy diet due to his love for fast food.  Family History:   His father died at age 72 from stroke-related complications and his mother died at age 76 from heart disease. He has one older brother who had an ischemic stroke at age 61.  Examination:  Upon arrival  his blood pressure was recorded at 180/110 mmHg and blood sugar was slightly elevated. Neurological examination revealed right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia  suggestive of stroke  with a NIH stroke scale score of 14.   Investigations:  His CT scan showed a hypodense area in the region of the left middle cerebral artery consistent with a recent ischemic stroke. An EKG showed no signs of recent infarction but did reveal left ventricular hypertrophy. His lipid profile was indicative of hyperlipidemia.   Treatment:  He was treated immediately with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). His blood pressure and blood sugar are being monitored and controlled as per guidelines.   Discussion:  Considering the demographic details and medical history of the patient  he falls into a high-risk category for stroke  as various factors contribute to the risk. Hispanics have a higher incidence of stroke than non-Hispanic whites  and patients with hypertension  diabetes  and smoking history exhibit an elevated stroke risk. Appropriate education about controlling his underlying conditions and the importance of medication adherence is necessary. Smoking cessation  dietary guidance  and referral to social services for financial assistance with medications will also be important steps in his overall management plan.   This case clearly outlines the unprotected risk factors that can lead to the development of cerebrovascular events and underscores the importance of risk factor management to prevent devastating outcomes such as stroke.
Stroke,9,36,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 64 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanic Location: Arizona  USA Marital Status: Married  Mr. Johnson  a 64-year-old retired Caucasian male  native of Arizona  presented to the hospital with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking  which evolved over the course of an hour. He is married with three adult children  all of them in good health. His wife  who was with him during the presentation  stated this is an acute change from his baseline health status.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a known history of hypertension for 10 years controlled with medication - Lisinopril 20mg once daily. He also has type II diabetes mellitus treated with Metformin. Over the past year  he has been non-compliant with his medications  doctor's appointments  and lifestyle modifications due to personal issues. He has no previous incidence of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). The patient is a former smoker having quit 15 years ago but admits long-term heavy alcohol usage.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson's father had a history of ischemic stroke in his late 60s and later passed due to complications related to the same. There is also a family history of hypertension on his paternal side  whereas his maternal history is significant for cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.  On admission  a complete blood count  blood chemistry including glucose  coagulation profile  and lipid panel were obtained. His blood pressure was noted to be high  185/100 mmHg. His random blood sugar was elevated at 280 mg/dl.  Considering Mr. Johnson's sudden onset of symptoms  his known risk factors of hypertension  diabetes  and family history of stroke  a quick response from the ER physician led to immediate neurology consultation. A CT scan was ordered immediately which confirmed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke.  Given the potential severe disability associated with MCA strokes  and after the risks and benefits were discussed with Mr. Johnson and his wife  Johnson was administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within the window period after initial inspection and updates to his medical record to include thisstroke incident.  This case emphasizes that adherence to medications  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups are extremely valuable in patients with longstanding hypertension and diabetes  given these two conditions substantially increase the risk for stroke. It also highlights the importance of quick response and appropriate management in acute stroke which can significantly affect the outcome.  Future visits and consultations with neurologists and possibly a psychologist can help Mr. Johnson to understand and better manage his condition. Public health initiatives for awareness on the risk factors and symptoms of stroke can potentially lead to better outcomes in the general populous.

Stroke,9,41,Presentation:  Patient Profile:  The subject of this case study is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of Ischemic Stroke. He's a retired engineer  married with two adult children  lives in an urban environment in New Jersey  USA. His BMI values categorize him as obese  and he has been classified as a moderate smoker for over 45 years  consuming approximately a pack of cigarettes per day.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of type II diabetes and hypertension  both controlled through medication and lifestyle modifications. Yet  he has had inconsistent compliance with medications and blood glucose monitoring. He has never been hospitalized before the stroke onset  barring his two knee surgeries related to sports injuries from his younger years.   Family History:  His father had succumbed to a myocardial infarction at age 59  and his mother had a history of type II diabetes and lived into her mid-80s. One of his siblings died from lung cancer  while the other is hypertensive.  Presenting Concern:  The patient was brought to the emergency department with acute symptoms of weakness of the entire left side and slurred speech that had been noted by his wife. They reported the symptoms started approximately 1.5 hours before their arrival at the hospital.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  The patient’s BP was high at 160/100 mmHg and blood glucose was raised at 9.0 mmol/L. Emergency imaging via Computerized Tomography (CT) indicated an early Ischemic Stroke in the right-sided region of his brain  specifically the middle cerebral artery region. EKG revealed no acute changes  and lipid screening showed high LDL.  Management and Follow-up:  The patient was initiated on aspirin and intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) therapy  as he was within the therapeutic window. Post-stabilization  he was referred to physical therapy for rehabilitation of the left-sided weakness.   Moreover  appropriate education was provided to him and his wife about the modification of risk factors  which included smoking cessation  strict blood pressure control  continuous compliance with blood glucose management  and the adoption of a balanced diet to manage weight and lower LDL cholesterol.  Despite an initial period of distress  with continuing support and timely intervention  patient prognosis improved significantly  as he demonstrated substantial recovery during follow-up visits.  Impression:  This case elucidates the substantial role of unmodified risk factors like poor glycemic control  blood pressure fluctuation  obesity  and smoking in the onset of a stroke. This affirms the need for rigorous patient education and follow-up as part of post-stroke management.
Stroke,9,42,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Gonzales  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  has been diagnosed with ischemic stroke. He was admitted at our medical facility complaining of sudden weekness of his left side body  difficulty in speaking and a sudden severe headache.   Past Medical History: Mr. Gonzales has a history of hypertension for which he has been taking medication for the past ten years. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  managed with lifestyle modifications  and metformin. He also has hyperlipidemia and intermittent atrial fibrillation that was detected one year ago. He has been moderatively adherent to his chronic medications.  Social History: He is a retired engineer  married with two children. Mr. Gonzales is a former smoker who quit two years ago but admits to occasional alcohol consumption.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 63 and his mother had a stroke at 70 years old. He has a brother who has angina and a sister with hypertension.  Findings on Examination: Neurological examination revealed dysarthria  left-sided hemiplegia and left homonymous hemianopia.

Early recognition of symptoms  prompt treatment  and appropriate rehabilitation are crucial for better outcomes in stroke management. 
Stroke,9,43,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Adams  a 64-year-old African American male  was brought to the emergency department by his wife  who reported that he had developed sudden onset slurred speech and right-sided weakness while at home.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which has been fairly controlled through a regimen of daily medications (Lisinopril/Amlodipine) for the last 10 years. He is also a known case of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin  and has a long-standing history of cigarette smoking (1 pack/day for over 30 years). His other medical history includes hyperlipidemia  treated with Rosuvastatin  and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years prior. He has no known allergies.  Family History:  Mr. Adams' paternal grandfather died following a stroke at the age of 70  and his father had similar experiences in his late 60s. His mother is alive and is a Type 2 diabetic. Heart disease also seems prevalent in his family. Both his father and one elder brother had premature coronary artery disease.  Explore:  On examination  Mr. Adams is alert and responsive  but he shows significant speech difficulty (dysarthria) and has right-sided facial drooping. His blood pressure upon arrival is high at 180/100 mmHg. Glucose levels are also elevated  and LDL is on the higher side.  Recent Imaging:  A non-contrast CT scan of his head reveals a new infarct in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery  confirming the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke.  Treatment:  The presentation was within the therapeutic window for thrombolysis. Therefore  along with stabilizing his vital parameters and continued medications for his longstanding conditions  the decision was made for thrombolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).   Plan for further evaluation:  Following the acute management  Mr. Adams would be evaluated further for the cause of the stroke  and a complete cardiovascular evaluation is planned. The patient would be started on antiplatelets (Aspirin) for secondary prevention  and a lifestyle modification program would be initiated  including smoking cessation  diet modifications  and physical activity guided by the physical therapy team.  Given the patient's race (African American men are at an increased risk of having strokes)  his history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and a previous TIA  his stroke risk was significantly high. This case underscores the importance of aggressive risk factor management in such high-risk patients for secondary prevention of stroke.   References: 1.

Stroke,9,44,"Patient Profile:  Patient """"A"""" is a 67-year-old African American male who resides in a suburban area of New York City. He is a retired banker  married  and has three adult kids. The patient is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol. He lives with his wife who is a retired school teacher.   Medical History:  Patient “A""""’s past medical history is significant for hypertension (well-controlled)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (diet-controlled)  and hyperlipidemia (managed with medication). He has no history of congenital heart disorders  cardiovascular accidents  or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). He has not reported any other significant health issues  surgeries  or allergies.  Recent Diagnosis: The patient presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with stroke i.e. sudden onset of left-sided weakness  slurred speech  and imbalance. A brain MRI confirmed the diagnosis of a right-sided ischemic stroke. The patient was quickly admitted for further management.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cerebrovascular disease. His father experienced a fatal stroke at the age of 72 and his maternal uncle had a non-fatal stroke at the age of 66. His older brother  aged 70  has been diagnosed with hypertension but has had no cerebrovascular events.   Clinical Examination and Management: Upon examination  Patient """"A"""" has a blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg  a pulse rate of 85 beats per minute  and blood sugar level of 160 mg/dL. He was immediately initiated on intravenous clot-buster treatment (tPA - tissue plasminogen activator) as thrombolysis within the first 4.5 hours following the onset of stroke symptoms is proven to improve outcomes.  Discussion: The case of Patient """"A"""" represents the demographic typically affected by strokes. African American males above the age of 65 have a higher risk of ischemic stroke  partly due to higher rates of hypertension and diabetes  as evidenced in this patient's case. The patient's lifestyle choices such as being a non-smoker and moderate-to-no alcohol use were protective factors  but his genetic predisposition and existing comorbidities such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes put him at risk.   This case underlines the importance of primary prevention strategies  including maintaining optimal blood pressure  blood glucose  and lipid levels to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent stroke among patients with high-risk conditions. Based on Patient """"A""""'s history and clinical findings  he would benefit from a secondary stroke prevention plan  which includes stroke rehab  management of his existing conditions  and lifestyle modifications."
Stroke,9,45,"Patient Presentation Case ID: 001 Gender: Male Age: 72 Ethnicity: African American  Medical History: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. He had been hypertensive for the last twenty years but was non-compliant with medications. The patient was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 twelve years ago  managed with metformin. He quit smoking ten years ago and claims moderate alcohol consumption. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the hospital with acute onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulties. He reported having experienced a sudden severe headache  something he stated as """"worst headache"""" of his life  along with nausea and vomiting.   Family History: His father died of coronary artery disease at the age of 70. His mother had a stroke at age 65 and died from her complications. One of his two siblings had a stroke in her early 60s.   Physical examination: Upon examination  the patient appeared acutely distressed. His vitals revealed a blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg and a heart rate of 85 beats per minute. The neurological examination demonstrated noticeable right-sided (hemiparesis) weakness with a power of 3/5  speech was slurred (dysarthria)  but cognition was preserved. His blood glucose was found to be elevated at 220 mg/dL.   Investigations: An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed an early ischemic stroke on the left side of the patient’s brain. Carotid Doppler study revealed significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and no signs of acute myocardial ischemia.   Summary: In summary  this is a case of a 72-year-old African American male with a history of poorly controlled hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. He experienced an acute ischemic stroke  likely due to atherosclerosis arising from long-standing hypertension and possibly diabetes  which are well-established risk factors for strokes in the African American demographic. Given the patient's non-compliance with medication  his risk factors were not mitigated  leading to his present condition.  Using this case as a reminder/goal  we should aim to improve patient education to ensure patients understand the importance of managing their conditions  perhaps decreasing similar incidents in the future."
Stroke,9,46,Subject: 63-Year-old  Hispanic Female Diagnosed with Stroke  I. Demographic Data Our patient is a 63-year-old woman of Hispanic descent. She's been living in a suburban area for the past 20 years  is a non-smoker  and has a BMI within the average range. She's a retiree who had worked as a teacher since she was 21. She lives alone after her husband's death five years ago.   II.  Chief Complaints The patient sought medical assistance due to a sudden onset of weakness in her right extremities  coupled with slurred speech and confusion.   III. Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  each condition managed with medication for the past 7 years. She also had gestational diabetes during both pregnancies but hasn't exhibited signs of chronic diabetes.   IV. Family History Her mother had experienced a stroke when she was 70 and lived with its after-effects for six years until her death. The father died at 75 of prostate cancer  and her only sibling  a sister  is living with multiple sclerosis.   V. Findings and Diagnosis The given symptoms and her medical history led to the suspicion of an ischemic stroke  which was confirmed by a CT scan.   VI. Treatment The patient received immediate treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (clot-busting drugs) given within the golden hours following the stroke.   VII. Prognosis The immediate attention received and subsequent treatment have positively affected her prognosis. Presently  her speech is improving  although motor function on the right side is still compromised. Rehabilitation therapies have started  and she'll be closely followed up on her progress.   The particularity of this case underscores the persistent risks of silent and manageable conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which  if insufficiently controlled  can lead to severe events like stroke. Hence  it underscores the importance of regular health check-ups and medication compliance. Her case also resonates with varying data suggesting that people of Hispanic ethnicity - especially women - have an increased likelihood of stroke  mainly when coupled with a family history of the same.  This case demonstrates the need for rigorous long-term management of these conditions amongst at-risk demographics and the effectiveness of fast responsive care in managing stroke effects.  This case presentation aims to deliver regular insights into our patient-centric care model by focusing on individual patient cases and the implications that accumulate from an extended view of their medical and social situation.
Stroke,9,47,Patient Profile: Patient X is a 62-year-old African-American male  who had been previously fit and well until he suddenly developed a severe headache and right sided weakness. He was brought to the emergency department by his wife when she noticed his symptoms.  Past Medical History: He is a known hypertensive for 15 years  on medication. Apart from hypertension  he has no known allergy or significant past medical history of diabetes  cardiovascular diseases or previous stroke. He has been taking medication for hypertension regularly  but despite medical interventions  his blood pressure readings were often above target.  Family History: His father had suffered a non-fatal stroke in his late 60s. His mother has hypertension and his older brother has type II diabetes.  Social history: Patient X is a retired civil servant who used to smoke about a pack per day for 20 years but quit about 15 years ago. His drinking is moderate  and he is not physically active since his retirement. His diet is heavy in sodium  and he prefers processed and canned foods. He has moderate levels of stress due to financial issues.  Clinical Details: Vitals at presentation: Blood Pressure: 180/110mmHg  Heart rate: 100bpm  Respiratory rate: 18/min  O2 Sat: 96% on room air  Temperature: 36.8°C. Neurologic examination showed right sided hemiparesis with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 8. Other system examination was unremarkable. An urgent CT scan of head was performed showing left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct. Further investigations to evaluate stroke etiology were planned.  Discussion: This patient falls into a high-risk group for stroke  being an African-American male with uncontrolled hypertension  past smoking habit and a sedentary lifestyle. His risk factors are supported by statistics that show African-Americans have nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with Caucasians. Hypertension is a major uncontrollable risk factor in this patient as shown in many studies. His family history and diet also make him a typical case for stroke.  Management was initiated as per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines. Thrombolysis was contraindicated due to time of presentation. Antihypertensives  lipid-lowering therapy  and antiplatelets were started  and physiotherapy was commenced for right sided weakness.    Suspected underlying etiology was large artery atherosclerosis  could be determined by further diagnostic studies including Holter monitoring  echocardiography and vascular imaging. Patient and caregiver education and support would be a key part of his recovery and future stroke prevention.   Through this case  we understand the importance of managing risk factors effectively and in particular  achieving good blood pressure control.
Stroke,9,48,Patient Profile: Mr. Edward Stokes  a 67-year-old African American male  was brought to the hospital by his wife who noticed sudden slurred speech  and a droop in the right side of his face while they were having lunch. Mr. Stokes has a past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia for which he is taking Atenolol  Metformin  and Atorvastatin respectively. He does not have any known allergies. His social history is significant for smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years and occasional alcohol consumption. He is retired from a job as a truck driver  living with his wife and has two adult children. His family history is significant for a father who had a stroke at an older age  and a mother who suffered from heart disease.   Presenting Complaint: The sudden onset of slurred speech and right side facial droop  two common symptoms of stroke  were what promoted consultation. Since the onset  Mr. Stokes reportedly also developed right-hand weakness within an hour.   Clinical Findings: On examination  Mr. Stokes was conscious and alert but had notable difficulty in speaking. His right facial droop was evident and power in his right upper limb was 3/5. His blood pressure was found to be elevated at 170/95 mmHg. His blood glucose level was also high at 240mg/dl.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Mr. Stokes was immediately sent for a head CT scan  which confirmed the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. A complete lipid profile was ordered and he was found to have high LDL levels.   Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: Mr. Stokes was given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the therapeutic window period for ischemic stroke. He was also administered intravenous fluids  insulin per sliding scale  and his anti-hypertensive. He was admitted to the Stroke Unit for close monitoring and an aggressive risk factor control approach was initiated.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Over the next few days  Mr. Stokes showed a gradual improvement in his speech and right upper limb power. His blood glucose levels and blood pressure were well controlled. After discharge  he was advised to follow a low salt  low-fat diet. He was recommended for rehabilitation and speech therapy  while at the same time was encouraged to quit smoking. A follow-up appointment after 2 weeks was scheduled to monitor the effect of therapy and to update his medication regimen.  This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of stroke  prompt management with tPA  and aggressive management of modifiable risk factors to reduce mortality and morbidity in stroke. 
Stroke,9,49,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Daniel Mendoza  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the hospital with sudden onset of unilateral weakness and difficulty in speech. He was at home when he started experiencing the symptoms and was brought to the ER by his wife.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both conditions are under management with anti-hypertensive medications and insulin  respectively. Mr. Mendoza also has a 20-year history of smoking but did quit 10 years ago. He has no documented allergies.  Family History: His father had a stroke at the age of 78 and his mother is diabetic. He has one brother who is hypertensive. There is no family history of heart disease or cancer.  Review of Symptoms: Mr. Mendoza was in his usual health condition until the onset of unilateral weakness and slurred speech. He experienced no headache  nausea  or vomiting. He denied having any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.  Current Medications: Lisinopril for hypertension and insulin for diabetes.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Mendoza was alert and oriented but had difficulty with speech. Vital signs at presentation were stable: blood pressure 150/95 mmHg  heart rate 85 bpm  respiratory rate 18 bpm  body temperature 36.9ºC  and oxygen saturation 98% room air. Neurological examination noted right-sided facial drooping  right upper and lower extremity strength 3/5  and slurred speech. Remainder of the examination was within normal limits.  Laboratory Tests & Imaging: CT scan of the brain showed a left-sided ischemic territory infarct. Blood reports showed elevated blood sugars and a slightly increased cholesterol level.  Impression: Mr. Mendoza was diagnosed with an Ischemic Stroke based on the symptoms and the CT scan. His diabetes and hypertension  both significant risk factors  likely contributed to his condition.  Plan: The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on aspirin  statins  and other acute stroke treatments per hospital protocol. He will need intensive physical and speech therapy post-stabilization. Smoking cessation and diabetes  blood pressure  and cholesterol management are essential. The patient and his family will also be educated about stroke symptoms for better early recognition if a recurrent event happens. Regular follow-ups with both a neurologist and primary care physician are advised.
Stroke,9,50,Patient Profile: Mr. James O'Sullivan  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department of Mercy Hospital at 8:45 AM on March 17th  2023. Mr. O'Sullivan is a retired schoolteacher  lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood  and is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history. He quit smoking 10 years ago.    Past Medical History: The patient’s past medical histories include hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for all of which he has been receiving treatment for the past 10 years. Mr. O'Sullivan maintains good glycemic control with Metformin and has well-controlled blood pressure with Lisinopril. His cholesterol level is marginally elevated  despite regular statin therapy.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. O'Sullivan was brought to the hospital after he suddenly developed difficulty in speaking and weakness on the right side of his body. His wife reported he was unsteady when trying to walk and that his face appeared to droop on the right side.  Family History: Mr. O'Sullivan's father had suffered a stroke at the age of 68  as well  which suggests a possible genetic predisposition. His mother had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and lived until the time of her death at the age of 77 due to age-related complications. There is no known family history of cardiovascular disease or cancer.   Clinical Examination and Investigations: On physical examination  Mr. O'Sullivan's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 80 beats/min  regular  and he was afebrile. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria  right-sided facial droop  and right-sided hemiparesis. His blood glucose level on admission was within normal range. An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.   A brain CT without contrast concluded an acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution  confirming the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.   Treatment and Management: Mr. O'Sullivan was admitted to the Stroke care unit. As he presented within the therapeutic window  intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was initiated after ruling out contraindications. Post thrombolysis  he showed significant improvement in his neurological symptoms. His anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medications were optimized and he was prescribed aspirin for secondary stroke prevention.   Prognosis: The patient responded well to the treatment  demonstrating the importance of quick recognition and treatment of these symptoms. He will need a comprehensive rehabilitation plan  including physical and occupational therapy to regain functional independence.  Summary: This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining vascular risk factors in order to prevent serious neurological outcomes like stroke  particularly for individuals with a family history of the disease. It also showcases the effectiveness of acute stroke treatment protocols in improving outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke.
Stroke,9,51,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male retired construction worker named Mr. Johnson. He is divorced with two grown children and four grandchildren. Mr. Johnson lives alone in a suburban neighborhood in Atlanta  Georgia. The patient is a non-smoker but regularly consumes alcohol  approximately three to four times a week. Mr. Johnson is known to enjoy American Southern cuisine  rich in fats  salts  and sugars.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson was brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech that lasted for about an hour. He was watching television when he experienced these episodes.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known case of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years. He also had a Myocardial Infarction five years back  which was successfully managed. Recently  he has shown symptoms of dementia but no formal diagnosis has been made.   Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had a fatal heart attack at the age of 57  and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 63 which led to her death. His older brother also has diagnosed hypertension. Family history of diabetes is unknown due to lack of health records.  Clinical Findings: On clinical assessment  Mr. Johnson displays symptoms of right hemiparesis (partial paralysis of the right side of his body) and facial droop. His speech is slurred  indicating dysarthria. Vital signs highlight a raised blood pressure of 185/95mmHg. Blood glucose is also elevated at 220mg/dl.  Investigations: He was immediately sent for a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain  which revealed a left middle cerebral artery stroke. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no abnormalities.  Diagnosis: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke  based on clinical findings and investigations.  Management: Mr. Johnson was admitted to the stroke unit for further management. As he presented within the RT-PA window  thrombolytic therapy was initiated after confirmed non-contrast CT ruled out any hemorrhagic conversion. His antihypertensive regimen has been adjusted in accordance with American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines  alongside plans for better glycemic control.  This patient's history of hypertension  diabetes  and previous cardiac event combined with his stroke-prone African American ethnicity  elevated age  male gender  and lifestyle factors likely contributed to his current ischemic stroke. As an immediate family member of multiple stroke and heart disease patients  his risk of stroke was  predictably  quite high. Regular health checks  better management of his pre-existing conditions  and lifestyle changes including diet modification and reduced alcohol intake could have potentially mitigated this unfortunate outcome. A comprehensive  inter-disciplinary approach to care and rehabilitation is recommended for Mr. Johnson.
Stroke,9,52,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Linda Smith  a 68-year-old African American woman presented to the ER with complaints of sudden onset of severe headache  dizziness  impaired speech  and numbness and weakness on the right side of her body.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith is a known case of hypertension and Type II diabetes  which she has been managing for the last ten years. She is also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and borderline obesity. She quit smoking about five years back when she was advised for CAD prevention after a cardiac wellness package.   Present Medication: She is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension  Metformin for diabetes  and statins for hyperlipidemia. She is also taking daily aspirin as advised by her cardiologist.  Family History:  Her father died of a stroke at the age of 75. Her mother  who remains healthy  has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Her elder sister died of a heart attack when she was 70.  Social History:  She is a retired high school teacher  living with her divorced daughter and two grandkids in a suburban neighborhood. She quit smoking about five years back but admits to having an unhealthy diet  primarily due to a lack of motivation to cook.  Physical Examination:  On examination  her blood pressure was recorded as 170/90 mm Hg and blood sugar of 156 mg/dL. Neurological examination showed a mild right side weakness  impaired speech  and a facial droop on the right side. The physicians used NIH Stroke Scale (initial score - 16) to quantify the impairment caused by stroke. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.  Test and Result:  A non-contrast CT head scan was performed at once which revealed a left middle cerebral artery infarct confirming an ischemic stroke.  Treatment:  She was immediately given IV-tPA (Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator) considering it’s within the 'door to needle' time. Her hypertension and diabetes were simultaneously managed. She has been advised to continue her medications with a stern advice on dietary modifications and strict control of her BP and Sugar. Physiotherapy for the limbs' weakness was also started.  Discussion:  This case presentation clearly underlines the fact that stroke affects a significant proportion of older adults  particularly those with a positive family history of stroke  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore  it emphasizes the importance of timely recognition of stroke symptoms  which can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment. Strict control of risk factors is crucial in such patients to prevent future occurrences.
Stroke,9,53,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 68-year-old African-American male  diagnosed with acute right-sided hemiplegia due to an ischemic stroke. This represents a significant demographic as stroke prevalence is higher in adults over 65 and disproportionately affects African-American populations. Mr. Doe was brought to the emergency department after being found by his wife on his bedroom floor unable to move his left side.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack years history who quit smoking ten years ago. He does not take his prescribed medications regularly due to financial constraints  representing a common issue among elderly patients. Prior to the described event  Mr. Doe had no previous cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) or transient ischemic attacks (TIA). He does not have any history of heart diseases  malignancies  or any other chronic diseases.  Family History:  His family history is remarkable for similar chronic conditions. His father had a stroke and diabetes; his mother had hypertension. Two of his siblings are alive and well  although one is diabetic.   Physical Examination:  On assessment  Mr. Doe was alert and oriented; however  he was unable to move or feel anything on his left side. A neurologic examination confirmed a dense left-sided hemiplegia suggestive of a right-sided stroke. His blood pressure was recorded to be 170/95 mmHg.  Investigations:  Routine lab tests were satisfactory  but blood glucose levels were elevated. A non-contrast CT brain revealed an infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory  confirming the diagnosis. Carotid Doppler and ECG were suggested to evaluate any possible embolic source.   This case emphasizes the importance of control and regular monitoring in patients with known risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  age  and race. It also underscores the consequences of non-compliance with medication regimens.  Plan:  The management plan for Mr. Doe will include acute stroke management  such as intravenous thrombolysis (if he fits the criteria)  control of blood glucose levels  and regular monitoring of his blood pressure. He will be referred to a stroke rehabilitation program for physiotherapy and occupation therapy.  Preventive measures  such as proper control of his diabetes and blood pressure  promotion of a balanced diet  regular exercise  and taking medications as prescribed will be emphasized. We plan to collaborate with a social worker to explore options to address Mr. Doe's concerns about medication costs.
Stroke,9,54,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. J  a 66-year old African American male  an ex-smoker with a 40-pack year history  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. He is a retired high school teacher  lives with his wife  and has no children. His last known normal state was found to be about 4 hours prior to presentation.  Past Medical History:  He has a known history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. His medication regimen includes daily metformin  atorvastatin  and amlodipine. He has no known drug allergies. No prior history of surgeries or hospitalizations.   Family History:  Mr. J's family history reveals a significant incidence of cardiovascular diseases. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his older brother had a stroke at the age of 55.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  his blood pressure was 162/98 mm Hg  heart rate of 102 beats/minute  and a regular rhythm. His speech was slurred  and he had right-sided hemiparesis. A subsequent neurological examination found that he had difficulty understanding spoken language  indicative of receptive aphasia  and right-sided facial droop.   Investigations: Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels of 180 mg/dL and high cholesterol of 220 mg/dL. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. A non-contrast head CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage  but there were early ischemic changes suggestive of stroke in the distribution of left middle cerebral artery.   Treatment and prognosis: Given the timing of symptom onset and absence of contraindications  the patient was treated with intravenous tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA). He was subsequently admitted to the stroke unit where a multidisciplinary team managed his case. With ongoing physiotherapy and stroke rehabilitation  the prognosis of Mr. J’s condition is cautiously optimistic. Strict management of blood pressure  glucose  and lipid profiles will be critical for his prognosis.  The patient's lifestyle changes  adherence to medication  and follow-up will be paramount in limiting the risk of secondary stroke. Family and social support will play a crucial role in his recovery and management of lifestyle changes.  The patient was educated on signs of stroke and was instructed to seek immediate medical care if they occur. Upon discharge  he was scheduled a follow-up appointment with a Neurologist.  [Note: It's always best to use real patient data when creating a case presentation. This is a fictional case that aligns with demographic data found in literature  which suggests that stroke is more common in the elderly  African Americans  and those with cardiovascular risk factors.]
Stroke,9,55,Patient Profile: Ms. Jane Doe is a 75-year-old African-American female who was brought to the hospital by her daughter after she started experiencing sudden weakness in the left side of her body and slurred speech. These incidents occurred at her home while she was watching TV after her dinner.  Past Medical History: Ms. Doe has a history of hypertension  which she has managed for 20 years with medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). Ten years ago  she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes  which she's been managing through Metformin and with dietary guidance provided by her primary care physician. Ms. Doe also has hypercholesterolemia and is on medication (Atorvastatin).   Family History: Her mother suffered a stroke at the age of 78. Her father had a history of hypertension and passed away due to a myocardial infarction at 80 years. She has one brother who is currently managing type 2 diabetes.   Lifestyle: Ms. Doe is a retired school teacher who lives with her daughter and two grandchildren. She has been a smoker for around 30 years  though she cut back significantly in the last 10 years. She has attempted to quit several times but always relapsed. She does not drink alcohol. Ms. Doe is not engaged in any regular physical activity but maintains a relatively healthy diet due to her diabetic condition.  Current Assessment: Upon arrival at the hospital  clinical staff noted that Ms. Doe had moderate aphasia and left-sided hemiparesis. An immediate CT scan was conducted that confirmed a right-sided ischemic stroke.   In light of her BBC3 score of 12  age  time of symptom onset  and the absence of contraindications  Ms. Doe was promptly treated with IV tPA. She was then directed to the stroke unit for further care and monitoring.   Conclusion: In Ms. Doe's case  several risk factors for stroke were present: age  African-American race  hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  family history of stroke  and a smoking history. This case highlights the importance of carefully managing chronic health conditions and lifestyle factors to reduce the risk of severe health outcomes like stroke.   The next step in her care involves acute stroke management  close monitoring  and the institution of secondary prevention measures to prevent recurrent stroke. Occupational and physiotherapy will also be significant components of her rehabilitation to aid in the recovery of her motor and speech faculties.
Stroke,9,56,[This is a hypothetical patient; individual medical information  interventions and outcomes may differ in real-world cases.]  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Smith Age: 72-years-old Sex: Male Race: Non-Hispanic White Occupation: Retired Engineer  Former Smoker Residential State: Florida  USA.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech. Symptoms began 90 minutes prior to arrival.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been prescribed medication for both conditions but his compliance has been irregular. Mr. Smith quit smoking five years ago but has a 30-year history of tobacco use.   Family history: His father passed away in his late 60s due to a myocardial infarction and his older sister is living with atrial fibrillation. There is no known family history of cerebral vascular disease or stroke.  Clinical Findings: Upon arrival at the ED  his blood pressure was significantly elevated. Neurological examination identified right facial droop  right arm weakness  slurred speech and difficulty finding words. His NIH Stroke Scale was calculated as 8. A head CT was quickly conducted which did not reveal any early infarct signs or hemorrhage.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient's sudden onset of symptoms  medical history  and clinical findings  he was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke. Time of onset was clear and within the therapeutic window for intervention.  Treatment: The patient was considered a suitable candidate for acute thrombolytic therapy. After providing informed consent  intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered. He is scheduled for magnetic resonance angiography to further investigate the likely source of the stroke.  Prognosis: Mr. Smith's prognosis will depend largely on the severity of the injury to his brain  his response to early intervention and his commitment to post-stroke rehabilitation.  Recommendations: A comprehensive rehabilitation plan is crucial for this patient. Encourage regular follow-ups  and emphasize the importance of medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications including a healthy diet  regular exercise  and no smoking as these are crucial in secondary stroke prevention. Mr. Smith should be informed about the need to identify and respond to any potential stroke symptoms promptly.  Follow-up after Discharge: Mr. Smith should be scheduled for follow-up visit in the clinic to re-evaluate his clinical conditions as well as adherence to lifestyle modifications and medical treatment.  This case reflects the demographic patterns observed in literature as stroke is common in elderly patients  men  people with hypertension  and diabetes. Caucasian and African American races have been associated with a higher risk of stroke compared to other races. The history of tobacco use and family history of cardiovascular diseases also puts our patient in a higher risk category for stroke.
Stroke,9,57,Patient Profile: Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old African-American male with a recent diagnosis of an ischemic stroke.

Stroke,9,59,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient's Profile  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: African-American Marital Status: Married Occupation: Retired engineer  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson was brought into the ER presenting acute onset of right side weakness and slurred speech that started about two hours before his arrival.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a documented history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which he has managed for the past 15 years with medication.  Family History: His father passed away due to a heart attack in his 70s  and his mother lived into her 80s with untreated hypertension. He has two siblings; an older brother diagnosed with hypertension and a younger sister with no known health issues.  Examination Results: On examination  Mr. Johnson had a blood pressure of 165/95 mm Hg. Neurologic exam revealed right-sided hemiplegia and dysarthria. His cholesterol levels were slightly higher than the normal range. Blood glucose level was found to be 211 mg/dL. He scored 14 on the NIH Stroke Scale. His ECG displayed atrial fibrillation.  Investigative Results: Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of his head showed an ischemic stroke in the left side of his brain consistent with his symptoms.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation and CT scan report  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke.  Treatment: He was immediately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  considering he was within the therapeutic window. His hypertension and diabetes were managed on medication and his atrial fibrillation was also addressed.  Prognosis: Despite the immediate treatment  Mr. Johnson's prognosis remains guarded due to his age  the severity of his initial symptoms  and his complex co-morbidity. He may require prolonged hospitalization and extensive rehabilitation.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the significant burden of stroke among the African-American population  particularly in those with a history of hypertension  atrial fibrillation  and diabetes mellitus. It emphasizes the need for prompt recognition and treatment of stroke symptoms to limit potential disability and improve outcomes. Critically  it underscores the importance of good control of these risk factors to prevent recurrent strokes. Education about stroke warning signs and the importance of immediate medical attention is also crucial in this demographic who are at a higher risk.
Stroke,9,60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking for the past few hours. His wife noticed his confusion and immediately called for medical help.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a known medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with these conditions approximately ten years ago but was noncompliant with his prescribed medication regimen due to side effects of antihypertensive and anti-diabetic medications. He also has a 45 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago after a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Weight and BMI indicate that Mr. Johnson is obese.  Family History:  His father had a history of ischemic stroke in his late sixties and passed away in his early seventies due to myocardial infarction. His mother  currently in her nineties  has well-controlled hypertension.  Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Johnson appeared confused. He had a blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg  a heart rate of 95 beats/minute  a temperature of 98.1°F  a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. He had noticeable facial asymmetry  left-sided flaccid paralysis  dysarthria  and was unable to follow commands.  Assessment:  A CT scan of his brain confirmed a right MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) stroke. No intracranial hemorrhage was visualized. His NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was calculated to be 16  indicating severe stroke.  Plan:   Given the severity of Mr. Johnson’s stroke and his current clinical condition  he was eligible for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This was administered under informed consent.  He was transferred to the stroke unit for further management including secondary prevention measures and rehabilitation. He has been referred to occupational  physical therapy  and speech therapy services to allow him to regain strength on his left side.   In regards to past medical history  his hypertension and diabetes are targeted to be better controlled through a combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications. Mr. Johnson is also recommended for a smoking cessation program that includes both counseling and pharmacotherapy when appropriate.  Education and counseling about lifestyle modifications  compliance to medications  signs of stroke  the need for regular follow-ups  and emergency steps in case of stroke recurrence are provided to both Mr. Johnson and his family.  Demographics:   Studies have shown that African American men have a higher risk of stroke due to a larger prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  as was the case with Mr. Johnson. He fell in line with the common age group for stroke  that is individuals over 65 years old.  Conclusion:   This case emphasizes the importance of early identification and aggressive management of risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and smoking in African American males. It also serves as a note that lifestyle modification  medication compliance  and patient education can significantly help in reducing the incidence of devastating events like a stroke.
Stroke,9,61,Presentation:  Patient Information  Mr. J  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with acute neurological symptoms. On presentation  he was found to have left-sided hemiparesis with expressive and receptive aphasia.   Present Illness  Symptoms began roughly 8 hours prior while Mr. J was at his manufacturing job. Co-workers noticed unusual slurring of speech  and Mr. J reported a sudden onset of left arm weakness.   Medical History   Mr. J has a past history of hypertension controlled with Metoprolol. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago with successful stent placement  after which he was prescribed daily Aspirin and Lipitor. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been controlled with metformin. There is no known history of any neurological disorder. Mr. J was also a heavy smoker until his heart attack  but has since quit.  Family History   His father died of a stroke at age 70  and his mother  currently 88 years old  has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes—the same illnesses Mr. J himself is suffering from. Mr. J's older brother  age 67  is in good health  while his younger sister  age 62  has been treated for hypertension and breast cancer.  Investigation and Diagnosis   Upon initial evaluation  a CT scan was performed  showing signs of a right middle cerebral artery stroke. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated blood pressure (170/90 mm Hg) and fasting blood glucose (180 mg/dL). His lipid panel also revealed elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (160 mg/dL)  and his BMI was calculated to be 30  indicating obesity. His occupational history  combined with his hypertension  history of myocardial infarction  and hyperlipidemia  contribute to a high-risk profile for stroke.  Management   Mr. J was admitted to the stroke unit. His current medications for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes were continued  along with an initiation of a thrombolytic  tPA. Mr. J was also referred to a dietician due to his high BMI  and a physical and occupational therapy regime was initiated to aid his recovery from the hemiparesis and help with work and life activities.   Discussion   Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S.  and a leading cause of disability. The risk is higher among men and increases with age  especially after turning 55 - demographics that Mr. J falls into. Incidence rates are also higher among African-Americans  likely due to higher rates of hypertension  diabetes  and obesity. Each of these risk factors were identified in Mr. J. Interventions targeting modifiable risk factors  improved control of comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes  and adopting a healthier diet and exercise regime would help in reducing the likelihood of recurrent stroke events in the future.    In conclusion  it is crucial to address stroke risk factors promptly and maintain a close follow-up regimen for at-risk individuals to prevent stroke and its subsequent ablative outcomes.
Stroke,9,62,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mrs. Angela Davis Age: 71 years old Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired school teacher  Mrs. Davis  a 71-year-old African-American female  recently retired from her job as a primary school teacher. She lives in Miami  FL with her husband. They have two adult children; a daughter who resides in the same city and a son living out of state.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Davis was diagnosed 10 years back with Type II diabetes  which is under control with metformin. She also has hypertension  managed by medication for the past 15 years  and hyperlipidemia which is treated with a statin. She is non-smoker but obese. There is no history of previous stroke or any other significant neurological disorder.   Recent Medical Event:  Mrs. Davis was brought to the hospital with symptoms of sudden weakness on the right side of her body and difficulty in speaking that lasted over a couple of hours.   Family History: Her mother died at age 65 due to a stroke  and her father passed away at 72 due to cardiac arrest. Stroke history on mother's side is a significant concern.   Clinical Findings: Upon examination  signs of right hemiparesis were present  and Mrs. Davis had difficulty speaking (dysarthria). A CT scan confirmed the presence of a left-hemisphere ischemic stroke.   Stroke Diagnosis and Relevance: The significant risk factors that play into Mrs. Davis’s stroke diagnosis include her age  ethnicity (African American descent increases stroke risk)  existing comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension  her weight  and strong family history. National data suggests that stroke incidence is higher in the southeastern region of the USA  which includes Mrs. Davis' residential area.  Treatment Plan: Mrs. Davis' early presentation to the hospital was beneficial and she was given a thrombolytic medication promptly. She will be referred for intensive physical and speech therapy  and an adjustment in her hypertension and diabetes medication is expected. Lifestyle modifications will be discussed to manage her weight and overall health. Regular follow-ups are advised to closely monitor her health status and recovery progress.
Stroke,9,63,Case Presentation  Patient Profile:  Mr. Miller  a 70-year-old retired teacher  is a resident of urban New York  NY. He is a non-Hispanic Caucasian and is married with three adult children. His socioeconomic status is middle-class.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Miller presented to the emergency department with slurred speech  difficulty balancing  and sudden weakness in his right arm and leg. These symptoms began abruptly while he was watching television at home alone. His wife found him in a partially responsive state and immediately called 911.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Miller has a known past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed with medication for 15 years. He also had a successful coronary artery bypass graft done 10 years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit 25 years ago. His compliance with medication and lifestyle changes has generally been good  but his blood pressure control has varied.  Family History:  He is the first in his family to suffer a stroke  but his father died at the age of 56 from a myocardial infarction. His mother died at the age of 80 from complications related to Alzheimer's disease. Two of his three siblings have been diagnosed with hypertension  and one sibling has been diagnosed with diabetes.  Clinical Findings:  Upon neurological examination  Mr. Miller showed signs of facial droop  right arm drift  and slurred speech. His blood pressure was 190/100 mmHg  and cholesterol levels were slightly raised. A non-contrast CT brain scan was performed that showed signs of an ischemic middle cerebral artery stroke on the left side.  Discussion:  Given Mr. Miller's presenting symptoms  past medical history  and current risk factors -age  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and smoking history - it was clear he had suffered an ischemic stroke. His long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia  coupled with his family history  put him at a higher risk for suffering a stroke.  Treatment Plan:  He was rushed to emergency medical care where he was treated with thrombolytics since he was within the therapeutic window. He was then transferred to an intensive care unit for management and close monitoring. His current antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications will be reassessed  and a referral to rehabilitation has been made for physical  occupational and speech therapy.  Long-term  Mr. Miller will need a significant commitment to lifestyle changes  including a healthier diet  regular exercise  and strict blood pressure and cholesterol management. He will also need close follow-ups and continuous monitoring of rehabilitation progress  blood pressure levels  and cholesterol levels. Psychological support will be made available  if necessary  to address any potential post-stroke depression symptoms.
Stroke,9,64,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old African American female  Mrs. Alice Singleton  living in Brooklyn  NY. Mrs. Singleton was brought to the hospital after reporting a sudden onset of confusion  severe headache  difficulty speaking and right-sided weakness. Mrs. Singleton also has a past medical history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease  managed through medications. She is obese with a BMI of 32  non-smoker  and moderate alcohol user.  She's been living alone since her husband's death five years ago. She is retired and has 3 children from who she receives constant support. Her family history reveals a significant prevalence of hypertension  heart disease  and diabetes. Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 76. Mrs. Singleton admits to having a diet high in salt and fats  coupled with a lack of regular physical exercise.  Upon physical examination  her blood pressure was significantly elevated at 185/105 mm Hg  and pulse was 85 bpm. A neurological exam revealed positive signs of facial drooping and arm weakness on the right side. Her speech was slurred  and she seemed confused. These clinical findings were indicative of a stroke  probably an Ischemic stroke due to her past history and symptoms.  An urgent CT scan was requested  and treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy was initiated promptly after the clinical evaluation  in accord with the established stroke treatment guidelines. Due to her high cardiovascular risk  clinicians began a comprehensive plan also aimed at preventing further cerebrovascular events  including tighter management of her blood pressure and modifications to her lifestyle.  Our priority is reducing the immediate risk of another stroke while treating this current one  considering the patient’s health history and her demographic’s heightened prevalence of recurrent strokes. Involve all necessary interdisciplinary teams to effectively manage her condition - this includes  but is not limited to  Physiotherapy for her motor functions  a Dietician for healthier dietary habits  and Social services for ensuring she has adequate care once she is discharged. Regular checkups and counseling sessions with the patient and her family will be issued to ensure compliance and to monitor the patient's recovery progress.  References: 1.

Stroke,9,65,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. James Landon  a 65-year-old African-American man  presented himself after experiencing sudden episodes of severe headache  confusion  trouble walking  difficulty speaking  and blurred vision. Based on statistics  African-Americans are twice more likely to die from stroke than Caucasians and tend to have strokes at younger ages.  Past Medical History: Mr. Landon has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled through medication. His blood pressure at hospital admission was 185/95 mmHg on antihypertensive medication and his low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 160 mg/dL (goal <70 mg/dL for his mutual risk factors) while on a statin medication. He also has a history of Type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin. He had also quit smoking five years ago  but had a 30 pack-year history. He has no known allergies.  Family History: On examining his family history  his grandfather had passed away suffering from a stroke  while his father has coronary artery disease. His older brother  aged 67  had a heart attack three years ago. Hence  a history of cardiovascular diseases is prevalent in his family lineage.  Clinical Presentations: Mr. Landon presented with acute onset of right-sided weakness  accompanied by sudden difficulty in speech. A neurological exam showed right-sided facial droop  dysarthria  right-side hemiparesis  and hemisensory loss.  Diagnostic Tests: A non-contrast CT scan of the head was immediately carried out  which did not show any hemorrhage. The CT angiogram of the head and neck showed left middle cerebral artery (MCA) clot. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 indicating severe stroke. The patient’s Hemoglobin A1C was 7.8 indicating poor glycemic control. He also had mild kidney impairment with an elevated creatinine of 1.5mg/dl.  Management and Treatment: The acute ischemic stroke was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)  within the 3-hour window from the onset of symptoms after ensuring no contraindications. Then  mechanical thrombectomy was performed to remove the clot from his left MCA. Initiating antihypertensive therapy  optimizing LDL-C control  and glycemic control was done parallely. His antihypertensive medication was switched to an angiotensin receptor blocker  and his statin dosage was increased.  Recommendations for Future Care: Mr. Landon was referred to a rehabilitation center for intensive therapy to aid his recovery following discharge from an acute care hospital. His cardiac risk should be managed with lifestyle changes  including a healthy diet  regular exercise  weight management  and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco.  Mr. Landon was also educated on the signs and symptoms of stroke so timely intervention could be sought in the future. Regular follow-ups with primary care  endocrinology  and neurology were recommended for tight blood pressure  cholesterol levels  and glycemic control and secondary stroke prevention.  This case presentation exemplifies the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of acute ischemic stroke  along with the significance of managing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes to prevent secondary strokes.
Stroke,9,66,Title: Cerebrovascular Accident in a 61-year-old Female African American Patient: A Case Study  Patient Profile: The patient is a 61-year-old African-American female  named Mrs. A Johnson. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her 64-year-old husband in an urban dwelling. The couple has three adult children. Mrs. Johnson is a non-smoker and only drinks alcohol occasionally.  Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which have been poorly controlled for around five years due to erratic compliance with medication. She is obese with a BMI of 33 and has a history of mild hypercholesterolemia. She suffered a transient ischemic attack three years ago but made a full recovery. During a routine check-up last week  Mrs. Johnson reported recent episodes of dizziness and transient blurring of vision. However  no immediate medical intervention was sought for her reported symptoms.  Presenting Complaint and Clinical Findings: Mrs. Johnson was admitted to ER with complaints of sudden onset right-sided weakness  difficulty in speaking  and headache which had begun 4-5 hours before. She had a blood pressure of 200/115 mmHg  pulse of 98/min  respiratory rate of 18/min  and blood glucose of 210 mg/dL. Her NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19  indicating severe stroke.  Radiological Findings: A Computed Tomography (CT) scan appended the diagnosis with evidence of an acute left middle cerebral artery infarction.   Family History: There is a strong family history of hypertension  diabetes  and cardiovascular diseases; both her mother and maternal aunt suffered strokes in their sixties.  Management and Follow-up: Currently  Mrs. Johnson is being managed under a multi-disciplinary team including physicians  physiotherapists  nurses  and a dietician. Her management plan includes antihypertensive therapy  anticoagulation with low-dose aspirin  statins for dyslipidemia  and insulin for diabetes control. She is also receiving physiotherapy to regain strength and function of the affected side. Furthermore  dietetic advice has been provided to help her lose weight and manage her diabetes better.  She has shown some improvements after two weeks of treatment but she still requires assistance for daily activities. Her husband and children have been apprised of her prognosis and are supportive.  This case is a significant representation of the higher stroke incidence in the African American population  especially in individuals with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of the disease. The poor control of these risk factors contributes to recurrent and severe stroke injuries. Educational programs to improve adherence to cardio-protective treatment and screening for stroke symptoms are needed to reduce the burden of stroke in this high-risk population.

Neurological examination revealed right-sided facial droop  aphasia and mild right-sided motor and sensory deficits. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Preliminary Diagnosis: Given the acuity of symptoms  his age  past medical and family history  a preliminary diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made.  Investigations: Immediately admitted to the Stroke Unit  an urgent CT brain was done to rule out hemorrhagic stroke  followed by MRI for confirmation. Routine blood work  coagulation profile  EKG  and a 2D echo were also ordered to rule out any cardioembolic source of stroke.   This is a brief but comprehensive case presentation of Mr. X.  who was diagnosed with a stroke and all relevant factors for his condition are taken into account. His condition was promptly identified and he received the required immediate medical intervention. 
Stroke,9,68,Patient Information: Mr. Robert Sullivan  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  residing in Tampa  Florida  was brought to the ER by his daughter after he began displaying symptoms of a stroke. He is a retired mechanical engineer and a war veteran. Mr. Sullivan is a widower with two adult children  who are both living out of State.   Presenting Issues: Mr. Sullivan had sudden onset of the left-sided weakness involving his face  arm and leg  as well as speech difficulties. His daughter noted these symptoms were present when she called him in the morning  which were not there the day before.  Past Medical History: Mr. Sullivan has had a history of uncontrolled hypertension and Type 2 diabetes for the past ten years  for which compliance to medication was suboptimal. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and is a former smoker  having quit five years ago. He does not consume alcohol.  Family History: Both of Mr. Sullivan's parents passed away in their late seventies due to cardiac diseases. His older brother had a stroke at 72 but no genetic disorders were documented.  Findings: A prompt neurological examination was performed which confirmed the signs of a stroke. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the severity of the stroke  resulting in a score of 15 indicating a moderate to severe stroke. An urgent CT scan was conducted  which demonstrated a right middle cerebral artery territory infarct.  Treatment Plan: Considering the patient's history and the ischemic nature of the stroke  he was not a candidate for IV thrombolysis due to the unknown onset time of the stroke. The patient has been started on aspirin 81mg for secondary prevention of stroke. He has also been recommended to a rehabilitation program for management of physical  speech and occupational therapy. An adjustment to his diabetes and hypertension medications has also been made to ensure better management of these conditions.  Mr. Sullivan's two adult children have been educated on their father's condition and the importance of medication compliance  regular follow-ups  and lifestyle modifications to manage his overall health and prevent a recurrent stroke. Genetic counseling for stroke risk has also been offered considering the family history.  Concluding Note: Mr. Sullivan's case presents the typical challenge of the high-risk profile for stroke in the elderly age group with hypertension  diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Cases like this underline the overarching need for better disease and lifestyle management in combating the threat of stroke.   All considerations were verified and cross-checked using the data and statistics provided by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure accurate demographic representation.
Stroke,9,69,Patient Profile:   Mr. James Smith is a 72-year-old African-American male residing in Chicago  Illinois. His social history includes being a widower living alone with three adult children living in close proximity. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has a past history of smoking  although he quit 10 years ago. He has social alcohol use with an estimated intake of 1-2 glasses of wine weekly. He leads a moderately active lifestyle and is diagnosed with controlled hypertension for the last 10 years. He denies any illicit drug use.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Smith presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurring of speech. He also reported difficulty walking and loss of balance  beginning approximately 2 hours prior to presentation. There was no associated headache  seizures  loss of consciousness  vertigo  or chest pain.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and mild hyperlipidemia  managed with Losartan and Atorvastatin  respectively.  Family History:   His father died of heart disease in his 70s and his mother succumbed to dementia in her 80s. He has no known family history of stroke  but his older sister has type 2 diabetes.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. Smith exhibited moderate left-sided weakness with associated decreased sensation. There was evidence of mild dysarthria but cognition was intact. His vitals exhibited a slightly elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 90 bpm  and all other vitals within normal limits.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings  sudden onset of symptoms  and risk factors like age  htn  and a history of smoking  a preliminary diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made.  Investigations & Final Diagnosis:  A stat CT scan was ordered which showed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct confirming the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.  Treatment & Follow-up:  Mr. Smith got thrombolytic therapy within the appropriate window as he presented early. He was admitted to the stroke care unit for further monitoring and adjustments of his antihypertensive medication. An occupational and physical therapy consult was also placed for the management of his left-sided weakness. His medications (Losartan and Atorvastatin) were optimised and he was emphasised upon lifestyle modifications.                                                                  Given his diagnosis  he has a higher risk of another episode. Outpatient follow-ups were scheduled along with echo and carotid Doppler investigation to evaluate stroke source. His children were informed about the signs of stroke and need for immediate medical attention.  This case emphasizes the importance of immediate medical attention upon the onset of stroke symptoms and also highlights the important role of early diagnosis for effective thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke. Additionally  it underlines the need for aggressive risk factor management in preventing recurrent strokes.
Stroke,9,70,Patient Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 66 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Medical History:  Mr. John has a history of hypertension  diagnosed around age 55  which has been generally well-controlled with medication  specifically Losartan 100mg once daily. However  his compliance with medication has been inconsistent. He has also been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus approximately 10 years prior to his stroke and has been managing it with Metformin 1000mg twice daily with fair glycemic control. His other medical history includes hyperlipidemia  managed with atorvastatin  and obesity.  Family History: Mr. John's mother had an ischemic stroke in her late 60s. His father had a history of coronary artery disease and died of myocardial infarction at 71. His older brother suffers from hypertension and his sister is a Type 2 diabetic.  Presenting symptom: Mr. John was brought into the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty walking.   On examination: John presented with a blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats/min  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min  and a blood glucose level of 7.6 mmol/L. Neurological examination revealed right-sided hemiparesis  facial droop  and dysarthria. An NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score of 14 was assigned  indicating moderate to severe impairment.  Diagnosis: An urgent cerebral CT scan confirmed a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke.  Discussion: This case highlights an under-controlled hypertensive  diabetic male patient  with a family history of vascular conditions  presenting with an acute stroke. Despite his known risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  family history and being of the male sex  the compliance with his medication was inconsistent  suggesting a potential area for intervention and education.  Future Focus: The management of Mr. John's situation should focus on secondary prevention strategies post-stroke  including consistent management of comorbidities  diet  medication compliance  and regular follow-ups. His family should also be targeted for stroke education and encouraged for regular screening due to their increased risk from their family history. Psycho-social support for Mr. John and his family should be provided due to the potential disabling consequences of the stroke.
Stroke,9,71,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. James Richardson Age: 65 years  Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Lives with: Wife in suburban residence   Presenting Problem: Acute onset right-sided weakness  slurred speech  Past Medical History: Chronic hypertension  Type II diabetes mellitus  Hyperlipidemia  as well maintained on medications. Quit smoking ten years ago. No previous incidence of stroke.  Family History: His father had a stroke at the age of 70.  RELEVANT CLINICAL FINDINGS:  Mr. Richardson was brought to the hospital by his wife  after she found him with decreased responsiveness  slurred speech  and right-sided weakness. Before this incident  he was in his usual health. His last known well time was approximately 2 hours ago  which makes him eligible for acute stroke intervention like intravenous thrombolysis.   Pertinent laboratory results are as follows: - Elevated blood glucose (210 mg/dl) - Normal renal function - Slightly elevated BP 160/95 mmHg at admission  - ECG shows no signs of arrhythmia   Imaging Findings: - An emergent unenhanced CT head was done which showed early signs suggestive of an acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.  ASSESSMENT:  Based on the patient's clinical presentation  imaging findings  and medical history  we can diagnose Mr. Richardson with Acute Ischemic Stroke.  PLAN:  The treatment plan involves intravenous thrombolysis using rtPA  with regular monitoring in a stroke unit. The secondary prevention measures such as introduction of antiplatelet therapy  optimal control of hypertension and diabetes are essential. The importance of therapy and rehabilitation services in the upcoming weeks to improve his chances of regaining function also discussed with him and his family.  Note: This case is representative of demographics typically impacted by stroke; however  stroke can affect individuals across all age groups  genders  ethnicities  occupations and lifestyles. Certain risk factors increase the likelihood  including age (the risk doubles each decade after age 55)  male gender  African-American ethnicity  and a family history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Modifiable risk factors include hypertension  heart disease  diabetes  smoking  heavy drinking  high cholesterol levels and obesity.
Stroke,9,72,Patient Information:  Mr. James Doyle  a 65-year-old African American male  was admitted to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe headache  slurred speech  and weakness on the right side of his body. His wife  who brought him in  reported that he has never had any episodes like this before.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are inadequately controlled due to poor adherence to medication regime and unhealthy dietary habits. He also has a decade-long history of smoking one pack cigarettes per day - a habit he quit recently  5 years ago. There is no history of any cardiac diseases or previous strokes. He has not been receiving regular health-care check-ups.   Family History:  Mr. Doyle's family history reveals that his father had a stroke in his late sixties. He also had a sister who had a heart attack and both his parents had Type 2 diabetes.   Clinical Findings:  In the emergency department  initial physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg and a blood glucose level  of 258 mg/dL. A neurological exam revealed a facial droop on the right side  speech impairment  right upper and lower limb weakness  as well as exhibiting signs of minor confusion.   Imaging and Diagnostic Studies:  An immediate CT scan was conducted which revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the left cerebral hemisphere. This was consistent with his symptoms of right-sided weakness and problems with speech. Further diagnostic tests showed elevated HbA1C levels  high LDL cholesterol levels  and an ECG report revealed left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of previous myocardial infarction.  Plan of Care:  Mr. Doyle was quickly administered with IV thrombolysis (Alteplase) within the therapeutic window period. Aspirin was started 24 hours after thrombolysis. His hypertension was managed with appropriate antihypertensives. His blood sugar levels were managed with insulin therapy. Physiotherapy was started for the right sided weakness. Upon stabilization  a comprehensive smoking cessation program  diabetes management  and diet regulation plans were planned for him.  Discussion:  In Mr. Doyle's case  several risk factors contributed to his stroke  including uncontrolled hypertension  poorly managed diabetes  smoking  and a family history of stroke. Ethnic and racial disparities exist in stroke incidence  with African Americans having a higher risk of stroke compared to other races  as found in numerous population-based studies. In addition  socio-economic factors like lack of regular health check-ups could further have jeopardized his health. The immediate plan of care focused on acute management of stroke  while the long-term management targets the modifiable risk factors to prevent further cerebrovascular events. 
Stroke,9,73,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  Mr. Martínez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male from Oakland  California  was transported to the emergency room after his daughter found him slumped on the kitchen floor.   Past Medical History:  Upon reviewing the patient’s medical records  it was noted that Mr. Martinez had a history of type II diabetes and high blood pressure  managed with oral anti-diabetic drugs and anti-hypertensives  respectively. He was also a previous smoker  quite overweight with a Body Mass Index of 31.4 kg/m2. Compliance with his medication regimen was not consistent  which was indicated by elevated HbA1c and blood pressure readings in previous medical follow ups.  Presenting Complaints:  Upon admission  he was disoriented and aphasic with right facial droop  and right-side weakness. Mr. Martinez’ daughter reported that he had been complaining of a severe headache since the morning.   Family Medical History:  His family history reveals that both of his parents suffered from hypertension and his father had suffered a stroke at the age of 68.   Clinical Findings:  Emergency medical services disclosed a blood glucose reading of 230 and a blood pressure reading of 180/95. NIH Stroke Scale conducted at bedside was 12  indicative of a moderate stroke. Upon conducting further diagnostic procedures  a non-contrast CT Scan showed clear signs of ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory.  Discussion:  Considering Mr. Martinez’ past medical history  presenting complaints  initial assessments and diagnostic findings  the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was confirmed. His pre-existing hypertension  diabetes mellitus  obesity  and family history of stroke were all significant factors contributing to his condition. High prevalence of stroke and associated risk factors are indeed reported in Hispanic populations. According to literature  compared with non-Hispanic Whites  Hispanics tend to have stroke at younger ages and have higher rates of recurrent stroke. Furthermore  this case underlines the importance of appropriate management and patient compliance in chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension which are known to significantly increase the risk of stroke.   Management:  Mr. Martinez was immediately started on Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA)  an emergency therapy that can help break up the clot and restore blood flow to the affected part of the brain. Long term stroke prevention measures will likely include maintaining blood pressure and blood glucose levels within a healthy range  use of antiplatelet therapy  resuming physical activity  dietary changes  and possibly referral for smoking cessation therapy in order to decrease the chances of recurrent strokes. Regular follow ups and strict compliance to medication regimen will be emphasized during patient counselling.
Stroke,9,74,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  The patient is Mr. Lee  a 65-year-old Asian-American male from San Francisco  California. He is a retired engineer living with his wife and has two children who live interstate. Mr. Lee was brought to the Emergency Department of our hospital with the classic symptoms of stroke (a sudden severe headache  slurred speech  right side weakness  difficulty seeing in one or both eyes).  Past Medical History: Mr. Lee has had hypertension for the past ten years and has been managing it with daily antihypertensive medication. He also has type II diabetes which was diagnosed two years ago; it is generally well-controlled through lifestyle changes  with occasional support from metformin. However  to our knowledge  this is Mr. Lee's first episode of stroke. Mr. Lee also has a history of smoking  although he quit 8 years ago  and moderates his alcohol use.   Family History:  His father had a history of stroke and passed away at the age of 70 from subsequent complications. His mother  who is alive and well at 90-year-old  has a history of arthritis. One of Mr. Lee’s elder siblings has been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension  like him.  Presenting Condition:  Mr. Lee was in his usual state of health until shortly before presentation when he experienced a sudden onset of throbbing unilateral frontal headache. His wife noted that his speech was slightly slurred  and he had difficulty in moving his right arm and leg. At arrival  his blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg; pulse  85 beats/min; respirations  16/min; and temperature  98.6°F.  Clinical Impression: Based on Mr. Lee's symptoms  past medical and family history  his clinical signs  and preliminary test results  he was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke.   Plan: Mr. Lee was promptly started on IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  the clot-busting drug. Given that his symptoms started less than an hour before his arrival at the ED  he was within the therapeutic window for receiving this medication. He will get a brain imaging scan to pinpoint the location and extent of the stroke. Other tests will include an ECG  blood tests  and a carotid ultrasound.   Considering Mr. Lee's case  emphasis should be placed on aggressive secondary stroke prevention  including optimization of his hypertension and diabetes management  promoting a healthier lifestyle  especially with regular physical activity and a balanced diet. He would also need considerable rehabilitative therapy to help regain as much functionality as possible in the affected limbs. His condition would require careful monitoring and follow-ups to track his progress and modify the treatment plan  as necessary.   Acknowledging his family history  genetic counseling could be beneficial to assess the risk of stroke for his children and potentially for Mr. Lee's siblings and their children.    This case emphasizes the need for comprehensive individual and familial risk assessment for stroke  especially in those with a known history of hypertension and diabetes.
Stroke,9,75,Patient Presentation  Summary: A 72-year-old Caucasian woman  Mrs. Johnson  residing in Philadelphia  is diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. She is retired and lives alone. She was brought to the ER by her neighbor who found her on the floor of her living room  unable to move her right arm and leg.  Background Information: Mrs. Johnson has a past medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes  both of these conditions have been managed with medication for the past eight years. Her father had a stroke at the age of 78  and her maternal grandmother also had a history of stroke. She is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago  but has moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to her long-term smoking habit. She reports no substance misuse but enjoys one to two glasses of red wine per evening.  Current Presentation: She was found in the early morning by her neighbor during their daily routine morning call. At the time of presentation  Mrs. Johnson had difficulty in moving her right side limbs and was unable to communicate clearly. An immediate CT scan revealed an occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery. Her blood pressure was monitored and recorded as 170/100 mmHg  her fasting blood glucose was 200 mg/dL  and her Body Mass Index (BMI) was within normal limits for her age and height.  The physical examination revealed right-sided hemiparesis (motor power 2/5) and aphasia. She has no apparent cognitive impairment prior to this incident and lives independently.  Management Plan: She received immediate tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for thrombolysis as she was within the acceptable time window of symptoms onset. Post-thrombolytic therapy  Mrs. Johnson showed some improvement in motor power (3/5)  but her speech remained affected.   Currently  her physicians have recommended a multidisciplinary approach  inclusive of neurologist  physiotherapist for her limb mobility and speech pathologist to improve her speech ability. Adjustments to her everyday life  such as alterations in her living environment and possibly a care support system  may be required in the future.  The above case presentation mirrors the high incidence of strokes among elderly  Caucasian women  with risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and family history of stroke as evidenced in literature (Stroke Association.org  2021).

Mr. Doe has two siblings  an older brother with coronary heart disease and a younger sister who is healthy.   Social History:  He performs light to moderate physical activity that includes jogging for 30 minutes at least 3 days a week. He follows an unhealthy diet mostly composed of fried foods and high intake of red meat  with low fruits and vegetables.   Examination Findings:  On examination  BP is 170/100 mmHg  pulse 80bpm  resp. rate 18/min  temp. 37 degrees Celsius  SpO2 96% on room air. Detailed neurological examination reveals right-sided hemiparesis and facial weakness. He is conscious  alert  and oriented in time  place  and person.  Investigations:  His ECG and chest X-ray are normal. His lipid profile showed total cholesterol: 210mg/dL (<200)  LDL: 145mg/dL (<130)  HDL: 35mg/dL (>40)  triglycerides: 180mg/dL (<150). Fasting blood glucose of 270 mg/dL. CT Brain reveals an acute left-sided ischemic stroke.  Conclusion:  Taking the patient's age  race  rural living  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  suboptimal diet  and family history of heart disease into account  he is at an elevated risk of stroke. More needs to be done in the terms of patient education and preventative care to avoid further complications. Slurred speech  right arm weakness  and diagnosis via CT Brain confirm the stroke diagnosis.
Stroke,9,77,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male referred to the emergency department due to an onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and confusion. These symptoms occurred suddenly during breakfast  and his wife  noticing the drastic change  decided to bring him to the hospital immediately.  Past Medical History:  The patient's previous medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both diagnosed ten years ago  and both of which have been poorly controlled despite medication. He has had no known prior strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). The patient also records a 30-year history of smoking (20 cigarettes/day) and a sedentary lifestyle  despite repeated advice to quit smoking and increase physical activity.   Family History:  His family history is significant  with both parents dying of myocardial infarctions in their early 70's  and his older brother having suffered from a prior stroke at age 65.  Social History:  The patient is retired from a job as a public bus driver  lives with his wife  has three adult children  and often babysits his grandchildren. He drinks alcohol occasionally but doesn't involve in any physical activity.   Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appeared alert but was having difficulty finding words and following commands. He had left-sided facial droop  mild dysarthria  left-sided hemiplegia  and hypoesthesia. His blood pressure was 164/96 mmHg  and pulse 92 bpm.   Radiology and Lab Findings:  A non-contrasted computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a right hemispheric infarct  located mainly in the region supplied by the right middle cerebral artery. The laboratory workup revealed elevated blood glucose and HbA1c (signs of uncontrolled diabetes)  and hyperlipidemia.  Summary:  The patient's suspected stroke was most likely secondary to chronic hypertension  poorly controlled blood sugar levels  his smoking habits  and the subsequent progression of atherosclerotic disease. Given his age  history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes  smoking habits  family history of cardiovascular disease  and his race  he is in a high-risk category for stroke.   This case signifies the importance of managing modifiable risk factors to prevent severe health complications such as a stroke. Persistent public health efforts targeting blood pressure and glucose control  cessation of smoking  and lifestyle modifications are essential for the prevention of stroke in high-risk populations.
Stroke,9,78,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian Gender: Male Occupation: Retired engineer  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and impaired vision on his right side which started approximately two hours ago.

Stroke,9,81,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 75-year-old African-American male  was brought to the emergency room due to sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking. He is a retired law enforcement officer and lives with his wife. They have two adult children. He is a non-smoker; however  he has a history of moderate alcohol intake.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has been managing hypertension and type 2 diabetes for over ten years. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and a daily aspirin. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and has been prescribed Atorvastatin. He got his last influenza vaccine 4 months ago. His BMI is noted to be 28 and he has a sedentary lifestyle.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had a stroke at the age of 65 and an elder brother died of a heart attack at the age of 71. His mother and sister both have type 2 diabetes.  Emergency History: On the day of admission  Mr. Doe was having breakfast when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness and slurred speech. His wife noticed his face was drooping on one side and immediately called the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). From the onset of symptoms to arrival at the hospital  approximately 45 minutes had elapsed. Based on initial evaluation upon presentation and information relayed by EMS  the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke.  Clinical Examination: Upon arrival  Mr. Doe's vital signs were stable  but he had noticeable left-sided weakness and mild slurred speech. His NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) was 6. His blood glucose level was mildly elevated  and ECG showed normal rhythm. A CT head scan revealed an early infarct in the right MCA territory indicating the possibility of acute ischemic stroke.  We initiated thrombolytic therapy within 3 hours of onset as per acute stroke guidelines  followed by secondary prevention measures after stabilizing his condition.  Conclusion: Considering the patient's age  race  medical history  and family history  he was at an elevated risk for stroke. This case emphasizes the importance of controlling modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and a sedentary lifestyle to reduce the impact of non-modifiable factors such as age  gender  race  and family history for stroke.  Note: This case presentation is purely fictional and is intended for academic and learning purposes only. Always follow your institution's protocols while handling real clinical scenarios.
Stroke,9,82,Patient Profile: Mr. Patrick Smith  a 72-year-old African American Male  resides in a suburban  predominantly African American  retirement community in Georgia  USA. He is a retired transportation worker and has a history of hypertension and type-2 diabetes. He was a smoker but quit at the age of 55. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a heart attack at 75  and his elder brother suffered from a stroke at 67.   Case Details: Mr. Smith presented himself to the emergency department on the morning of October 3rd after waking up with difficulty speaking and a weakening right hand. His wife reported that he seemed 'just fine' until breakfast when he showed symptoms  proving quick onset. On examination  he was found to have right-sided facial droop  slurred speech  and right-sided weakness. His initial CT scan did not reveal any acute intracranial pathology. His blood pressure on presentation was 167/98 mmHg and his blood glucose was 246 mg/dl.  Discussion: Given Mr. Smith's symptoms  a diagnosis of ischemic stroke was established. It aligns with his risk factors such as age  race (African American men have a higher risk of stroke than their white counterparts)  family history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension  diabetes  and past smoking habits. Due to the clear time of symptom onset  within the 4.5 hours window for thrombolysis administration  the patient was treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A detailed evaluation managed to unearth atrial fibrillation as a likely etiological factor. Stroke secondary to embolism from non-valvular atrial fibrillation was considered as the main cause of Patrick's stroke.   Management & Follow Up: Mr. Smith spent two days in the Stroke Unit and was then transferred to a Rehab Unit for occupational  physical  and speech therapy. He responded well to the treatment. Additionally  his diabetes and blood pressure are under active management post-rehabilitation. Mr. Smith's case necessitates adherence to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association's guidelines for secondary prevention  considering his identified risk factors. Measures like antiplatelet therapy  statin strategy for lipid control  blood pressure control  and anticoagulation therapy considering atrial fibrillation are recommended.   The case also highlights the importance of addressing the higher risk and mortality rate in African American populations through particularly targeted policies and interventions for primary and secondary stroke prevention. It's crucial to ensure better management/control of primary risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in these communities. Additionally  it reinforces the need for continuing public awareness campaigns about the warning signs of stroke and timely presentation to the hospital.

His body mass index is 32 indicating obesity.  Management: Mr. Ramirez was administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 2 hours of his symptom onset as part of the acute management of ischemic stroke. The stroke team was involved and his medications were reviewed and adjusted as per his current medical condition.  Future Considerations: Given the patient's age  medical history  and unhealthy lifestyle  a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is recommended. This includes strict blood pressure control  improved diabetes management  healthy diet  maintaining ideal body weight  regular physical activity  smoking cessation  and individual or family counseling. Long-term management includes antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent strokes.  Summary: This case illustrates the difficulty of managing patients with multiple comorbidities and the importance of primary prevention of stroke  especially amongst high-risk individuals. Patient education to improve medication adherence and lifestyle modifications play a significant role in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with strokes. Furthermore  the case provides insight into the acute management of stroke and necessary long-term prevention strategies.
Stroke,9,84,Patient Information:   Mr. John Thompson  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with symptoms of sudden confusion  difficulty speaking  and loss of balance  which started 2 hours before arrival.  Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He had been prescribed medication for both conditions  but his adherence to the regimen was inconsistent due to financial difficulties. He reported to have quit smoking 5 years ago  but still occasionally drinks alcohol. He does not engage in regular physical activities and follows a diet high in fat and sodium. He had never experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack before this event.  Demographics:  Mr. Thompson lives in an urban community in Atlanta  Georgia. He is a retired mechanical engineer and lives with his wife. He has two adult children  none of whom live with him. He relies on a local transportation service for senior citizens for his medical appointments.

His older brother  who is currently 68 years old  had a mild stroke last year but has since recovered with only minor deficits. His sister  on the other hand  at 62  hasn't had any cardiovascular events  but has been diagnosed with hypertension.  Hospital Course:  Upon admission  Mr. Thompson had a CT scan which confirmed the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke. His glucose levels were elevated  and his blood pressure was 175/95 mmHg. He was started on tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within 3 hours of symptom onset.  Throughout his hospital stay  his glucose levels and blood pressure were closely monitored and managed. He started physical therapy sessions for his balance issues and slurred speech. Social services were also involved to ensure that he had resources to adhere to medication after discharge and to accommodate the new physical limitations at home.  Prognosis:   With his age and history of hypertension and diabetes  Mr. Thompson’s risk of recurrent stroke is high. Lifestyle changes were strongly recommended  including a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  strict adherence to medications  and abstinence from alcohol.  Summary:  In this case  Mr. Thompson’s demographic factors  such as his age  gender  race  and living location align with the literature stating these all contribute to higher stroke risk. Likewise  his medical history and lifestyle choices also contribute to this elevated risk. With the appropriate therapeutic strategies and lifestyle modifications  the intention is to reduce his risk of a recurrent stroke.
Stroke,9,85,Patient's Initials: R.S.  Age: 72  Sex: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History: R.S. has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II. He has been hospitalized once for a hypertensive crisis  but reportedly controls his blood pressure with medication. His last recorded HbA1c level was 7.2%  indicating suboptimal control of his diabetes. He also has a history of smoking (1 pack/day for over 40 years)  though he quit approximately 10 years ago.  Presenting Complaint & Clinical Signs: R.S. was brought in by his daughter after she noticed his slurred speech and impaired right arm function. On examination  he had a positive face-arm-speech-time (FAST) test  indicating a stroke. Apart from slurred speech and right-sided weakness  R.S. also showed signs of confusion and spatial disorientation.  Family History: R.S. has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his younger sister has recently been diagnosed with heart failure.  Investigations: An immediate CT scan was ordered which demonstrated an occlusive clot in the left middle cerebral artery  confirming an ischemic stroke. His blood pressure recorded was 165/90 mmHg and blood sugar was 210 mg/dl. A subsequent ECG showed no abnormalities. Blood tests revealed elevated LDL cholesterol levels.  Stroke is more common in the African American population due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. This case reinforces the significant influence of these risk factors. R.S's long smoking history and his poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes have likely played a profound role in the occurrence of the stroke. The patient's family history of cardiovascular disease further adds to his personal risk.  Management: R.S. was given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) after the confirmation of ischemic stroke. He was also initiated on antihypertensives  statins  diabetes medication and anticoagulants. A referral was made to physiotherapy and occupational therapy for his right-sided weakness. He was also referred to a dietitian to help manage his diabetes and recommended a low-sodium diet  given his hypertension.   Outcome & Prognosis: It is critical that R.S. maintains strict control over his blood pressure and glucose levels  as well as adheres to his medication regimen  to reduce the possibility of recurrent strokes. Early physiotherapy is also crucial for improving R.S.'s motor function and overall quality of life. Literatures show that stroke recovery may take months or years depending on the extent of the damage and the patient's overall health condition. Regular follow-ups with his physician and continued multidisciplinary support will be critical to his recovery process.
Stroke,9,86,Patient Profile:  Mr. Fernando Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  was brought to the emergency room after suddenly collapsing while having lunch with his family.

Both conditions were managed with medications.  Demographics Information:  Mr. Rodriguez resides in Brownsville  Texas  with his wife of 45 years. He is a retired warehouse supervisor and spends most of his day managing the family’s small farm. According to CDC statistics  strokes are common in this age group and are the fifth cause of death in Texas  with a higher prevalence among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic white populations.  Family History:  Mr. Rodriguez’s family history reveals that his mother had a stroke at the age of 75. His father  who had a history of hypertension and diabetes  died at 67 due to myocardial infarction. His 72-year-old elder brother had a stroke two years ago.   Clinical Presentation and Relevant Information:  On admission  Mr. Rodriguez presented with right-sided weakness  facial droop  and speech difficulties. His wife reported that he also experienced a severe headache justo before collapsing  which is unusual for him. His blood pressure was elevated (180/90 mmHg)  and his blood glucose level was moderately high (228 mg/dL).   Considering his symptoms  long-standing history of hypertension  diabetes  and a strong family history of stroke  a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. This was later confirmed by a CT scan which revealed an ischemic infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory.  The case of Mr. Rodriguez emphasizes the significant risk factors for stroke  including age  hypertension  diabetes  and a strong family history of stroke. It demonstrates the importance of early recognition of stroke symptoms and immediate presentation to the hospital  which can significantly influence the patient’s outcome.

He has been diagnosed with an ischemic stroke.  Past Medical History: Mr. Williams has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both were diagnosed ten years ago. He has been compliant with medication but has been partially controlled. He's also a known smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack-years.  Family History:  His father had his first stroke at the age of 70 and later succumbed to a second stroke. His mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes.   Social History: He is a retired construction worker  estranged from his wife  living alone  and has one daughter. He admits to regularly consuming alcohol and continues to smoke  despite medical advice.  Clinical Findings and Lab results: On examination  his blood pressure was 190/100 mm Hg  pulse 82 regular  respiratory rate 20  and temperature 98.6°F. He scored 12 on the NIH Stroke Scale. His right side showed significant weakness  speech was slurred  and coordination tests were abnormal. His CBC  electrolytes  renal function tests  and lipid profile were normal except for elevated blood glucose of 180 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol of 150 mg/dL.  Imaging: CT scan of the head showed an ischemic lesion in the left middle cerebral artery territory.  Discussion: Given Mr. Williams' risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  smoking  a family history of stroke  and African American ethnicity)  he represents the typical profile of a patient at high risk of stroke. His existing conditions  modifiable lifestyle stressors such as smoking and drinking alcohol are major contributors to the stroke  apart from his genetic predisposition.  Conclusion: Mr. Williams was promptly given tissue plasminogen activator therapy after ruling out hemorrhagic stroke  keeping in mind the golden hour for stroke treatment. His blood pressure  blood sugar  and other comorbidities are being managed. Further  he has been recommended for smoking cessation  limiting alcohol  proper diet  and regular exercise. His daughter has been informed about the importance of strict compliance with medication. After the acute management  he will need structured rehabilitation and long-term secondary prevention of stroke.   Lastly  the case is an important reminder about the high risk of stroke among African American males  who have the highest rate of stroke prevalence among ethnic groups in the United States  largely attributed to the higher prevalence of hypertension and other risk factors. This underscores the need for targeting this group for aggressive risk factor control and early identification and treatment of stroke-warning symptoms.

It highlights the importance of early recognition of stroke symptoms  and timely medical intervention. It also emphasizes the significance of good control of underlying conditions and lifestyle modifications in preventing catastrophic events like a stroke.   Note: This presentation of stroke is highly typical for elderly  African-American males  whose stroke and hypertensive risks are markedly higher when compared to other demographic categories  for a multitude of reasons including but not limited to prevalent lifestyle choices  genetic predisposition and disparities in access to quality medical care.
Stroke,9,91,Patient Background  Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old African-American male residing in Houston  Texas. He is a retired mechanical engineer and currently lives with his wife in their family home. He has two children  both in their late 30s.   Presenting Complaint  Mr. Jones presented at the emergency room with complaints of sudden weakness in his left arm and leg  along with a slight drooping in the left side of his face  which his wife noticed. There was also a reported difficulty in speech  with Mr. Jones slurring his words.   History of Present Illness  Mr. Jones reports that he woke up with these symptoms  with no prior warning or discomfort the night before. The sudden development of his symptoms raised concerns of a possible stroke.   Past Medical History  Mr. Jones has a ten-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which has been managed with Metformin. He also has Hypertension for which he is taking Hydrochlorothiazide. Both his blood glucose and blood pressure have been relatively well-controlled with the medication. He has no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Three years ago  he was diagnosed with Hyperlipidemia  a high cholesterol condition  which is kept under control with the administration of statins.   Family History  His mother suffered a stroke at the age of 75 and his father passed away at the age of 77 due to a myocardial infarction. Apart from his parents  no other immediate or extended family member has a recorded history of stroke or other cerebrovascular diseases.  Physical Examination and Test Results  Upon physical examination  Mr. Jones' blood pressure was elevated at 155/95 mmHg. Initial laboratory tests showed normal kidney and liver function  but blood glucose level was slightly elevated and cholesterol levels were high  despite consistent use of statins. An emergent CT scan did not show any evidence of a hemorrhage but revealed an area of decreased density in the right cortical area  suggesting an ischemic stroke.  Diagnosis  Based on the clinical presentation and radiologic findings  Mr. Jones was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke.  Treatment Plan  Mr. Jones was immediately started on a thrombolytic (tissue plasminogen activator) within the window of eligibility. He will continue his Metformin  Hydrochlorothiazide  and statin therapy. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) will be added to his regimen.   Plan for follow-up outpatient care includes more aggressive control of his blood glucose and lipid levels  along with continued management of hypertension. The addition of a low-sodium and low-cholesterol diet is also advised. Regular physical therapy appointments will be required for rehabilitation. He's advised to participate in a community stroke recovery program  which also provides emotional and psychological support.  Mr. Jones represents a typical demographic of stroke patients – elderly  African American  and with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. His case highlights the importance of strict cardiovascular risk management in individuals with similar characteristics to reduce their risk of stroke.
Stroke,9,92,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John  Age: 68 Sex: Male Race: African-American Location: Urban  New York   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. John was brought to the hospital by his neighbor after he suddenly developed a severe headache followed by difficulty in speaking and numbness on his right side.  Past Medical History:  Mr. John has hypertension and Type 2 diabetes which he manages with oral medications  but his control over both conditions has been suboptimal in recent months. He also has a history of smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years but quit smoking 10 years ago.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cerebrovascular disease. His father had a stroke at the age of 73  and his mother had multiple small strokes later in life.  Present Illness:  On detailed questioning  it was found that Mr. John has experienced transient episodes of right-sided numbness and slurred speech; however  these resolved within an hour and he did not seek further medical attention. These episodes suggest transient ischemic attacks.   Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. John was found to have right-sided hemiparesis and expressive dysphasia. His blood pressure was significantly elevated at 180/100 mm of Hg.  Investigations:  A non-contrast CT brain was performed  which showed an acute ischaemic stroke in the area supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. His blood sugar levels were also elevated  and his HbA1C indicated poor diabetes control.   Treatment:  Mr. John was managed as a case of acute stroke and was immediately given intravenous thrombolytic therapy because he arrived at the hospital within the therapeutic window. His hypertension has been controlled intravenously  and consultants have started therapy for better glycemic control.   Outlook:  Given that hypertension  diabetes  and smoking are significant risk factors for strokes and that African-Americans are at a higher risk compared to other races  Mr. John's lifestyle and medical history likely contributed significantly to his condition.   Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of efficient management and control of risk factors and early presentation to the hospital in the case of suggestive symptoms to limit the extent of cerebral damage and disability following a stroke. It's important to conduct educational programs focusing on stroke risk factor control and stroke symptom recognition  especially in African-American communities.
Stroke,9,93,Patient Case Presentation: Stroke  Background: The patient  Mr. Edwards  is a 67-year-old African-American male who was previously self-employed and married. His presenting complaint was sudden weakening of the right side of his body and difficulty in speech. Mr. Edwards visited the ER department in the evening after his wife noticed his unusual behavior and inability to express himself verbally.  Demographics: Mr. Edwards lives in a suburban area in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania with his wife and has three adult children. He is a retiree with a high school education  and his primary language is English.   Past Medical History: Mr. Edwards is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31. He has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which have remained fairly controlled with diet  exercise  and medication. He was also diagnosed 10 years ago with hyperlipidemia  for which he takes statins.  Family History: His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction in his mid-sixties  and his mother had a stroke in her early seventies.  Presenting Problem:  On examination  Mr. Edwards presented with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. His NIH Stroke Scale score at the time was 8. There was no sign of head trauma  and his consciousness level was normal. His blood pressure was high  measuring at 170/90 mmHg.  Investigations & Diagnosis: A CT scan did not show any hemorrhage or tumors  but an MRI showed an infarction in the region of the left middle cerebral artery. An Echocardiogram revealed no embolic sources  giving strength to the diagnosis of Ischemic Stroke.  Management & Treatment: Mr. Edwards was admitted to the stroke unit for thrombolytic therapy which had commenced approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes after symptom onset. Diabetic and hypertensive management were also optimized.  Discussion:  This case is a typical presentation for stroke  considering the patient's risk factors such as age  race  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  obesity  and hyperlipidemia. It is worth noting that African American men are disproportionately affected by stroke. Their stroke mortality rates are about twice as high as Caucasians and Hispanics  making stroke prevention  recognition  and treatment incredibly important in this population demographic.  Note: This is a fictional case designed for teaching and discussion. 
Stroke,9,94,Patient Profile: Mr. David Rogers is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  living in rural Ohio. He is recently retired as a machine mechanic and has a long history of cigarette smoking  approximately a pack/day for the past 50 years. He is married and has two children. His father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 66  and his mother had diabetes  hypertensive cardiovascular disease  and died at the age of 78.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Rogers has been feeling weak and dizzy since the last two days  with an abrupt loss of balance accompanied by difficulty speaking  which prompted his visit.  Medical History: Mr. Rogers has a medical history of being hypertensive and diabetic for the last 15 years. Control of hypertension and diabetes has been suboptimal over the years due to irregular monitoring and lack of strict adherence to prescribed medication. His last recorded BP (1 month ago) was 160/95 mm Hg while his fasting blood sugar was 180 mg/dL. Mr. Roger's lipid profile was also significantly high with total cholesterol at 230 mg/dl.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  Mr. Rogers showed conscious but disoriented characteristics. His BP on presentation was 165/100 mm Hg. He showed left-sided weakness (4/5 power)  impaired sensation on the left side  and expressive dysphasia  suggestive of a stroke.   Investigations: An immediate CT scan showed an ischemic infarct in the right Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory. Blood investigations showed raised Random Blood Sugar levels (220 mg/dL)  elevated serum cholesterol (240 mg/dl)  and HbA1c of 9%.  Diagnosis: According to the clinical findings and investigations  Mr. Rogers has been diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke.  Management: Mr. Rogers was admitted to the hospital and started on IV fluids  insulin for diabetes control  and an antihypertensive. As the window for thrombolysis had passed (more than 4.5 hours since the onset)  he was started on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin). He was also given statins to control his cholesterol levels. His progress will be monitored and he will also receive physiotherapy and speech therapy as part of his recovery.  This case of Mr. Rogers offers a typical presentation of stroke in a senior patient with modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol. Lifestyle habits  including long-term smoking and poor medication adherence  have also played a significant role in this case. His family history adds to his predisposition to cardiovascular events. Immediate and continuous interventions are needed to manage the existing stroke and prevent possible future events.
Stroke,9,95,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information: A 68-year-old African-American male  a registered patient in a stroke rehabilitation unit.  Reason for Admission:  He was admitted to the emergency department on January 7th due to sudden weakness on the right side of the body and slurred speech. The man’s wife noticed these symptoms and immediately called an ambulance.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago  but he has been non-adherent to his prescribed diet and medication regimen. The patient is a former smoker (stopped ten years ago) and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Family History:  His father passed away at the age of 72  due to a massive heart attack. The patient also has a younger brother who  at the age of 59  suffered from an ischemic stroke. Consequently  our patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Examination and Investigation: On neurological examination  the man presented with hemiplegia on the right side and dysarthria. His blood pressure on admission was 170/95 mmHg and blood sugar consistently ranged between 180-220 mg/dl. Brain MRI demonstrated an acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery region  indicative of an ischemic stroke.   Diagnosis: Given his symptoms and the results from his brain MRI  the patient was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke.  Management and Treatment:  Following the acute management of his stroke and stabilizing his blood pressure and blood sugar levels  the patient was transferred to the stroke rehabilitation unit. He is under the monitoring of a team of healthcare professionals  including a physiatrist  physical and occupational therapists  a dietitian  and a social worker.  Prognosis: Recovery and prognosis are largely dependent on the patient's adherence to rehabilitation strategies and management of his risk factors. With controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels  along with successful therapy  his chances of regaining some physical function are promising. However  there’s still a risk of recurrent stroke  long-term disability  and cardiovascular events due to his medical history and age.  Family/Patient Education: The patient and his family are being educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications (such as healthy diet  regular physical activity)  regular medication compliance and follow-ups  early signs of stroke  and the necessity for immediate medical attention in case of recurrent stroke symptoms.   Follow-up Care: The patient is expected to attend outpatient therapy sessions and regular check-ups with his primary physician to monitor his blood pressure  blood sugar levels  and other potential health issues.   Such patients represent a typical demographic - older African-American males  with a family and personal history of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases  exhibit a higher risk for strokes as per the literature.
Stroke,9,96,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Hispanic female  a retired school teacher  living in an urban city situated in the South West region of the United States.  Presenting Concerns: She came to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset of slurred speech and weakness on the right side of her body that started an hour prior to admission. She also reported feeling dizzy and experiencing a severe headache. There was no history of trauma.  Medical History: The patient has a five-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. No previous surgeries or strokes have been coded in her medical history. She is non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Family History: Her family history reveals that both her parents had hypertension  and her father died of ischemic heart disease. Her mother reportedly had a history of stroke in her late 70s. She has two siblings – a brother diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and a sister with no known medical issues.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient had a blood pressure of 195/95 mmHg  pulse rate of 78 beats per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She demonstrated dysarthria and right-sided hemiparesis  with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10.  Investigations: The patient underwent immediately a CT scan  which revealed left MCA infarction. Blood tests showed elevated HbA1c levels (9.2%)  elevated LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL)  and slightly raised Creatinine (1.6 mg/dL).  Treatment Plan: The neurologist initiated an immediate intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)  as the patient arrived within the therapeutic window of 4.5 hours. The patient’s poor diabetes control was also addressed with an optimized insulin regimen. Antihypertensive medication was also started for better BP control.  Prognosis: Given the patient's older age and the presence of multiple risk factors (diabetes  hypertension  and stroke)  she is at high risk for potential recurrent cerebrovascular events. Early intervention  optimized treatment  and risk factor modification will be crucial for her future health.  This case highlights the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms  managing stroke risk factors  and timely therapeutic interventions to improve patient outcomes. It also emphasizes the significance of health education concerning diabetes and hypertension management in high-risk populations  such as the elderly Hispanic population in this case.
Stroke,9,97,Patient Profile  Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 65 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired Mechanic  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speech  which started about 2 hours ago.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  all of which have been sub-optimally controlled due to poor medication adherence. He had myocardial infarction 5 years ago  which was managed conservatively. There is no known allergy.   Social History: Mr. Smith is a smoker with a 40 pack-year history. He drinks alcohol occasionally and has an unhealthy diet  predominantly high in fats and salts. He lives alone since his wife passed away a year ago.   Family History: His father had a stroke at 70 and died at 75 due to cardiac reasons. His mother suffered from diabetes and hypertension. She died at 78 from a stroke. He has one older brother who also suffers from hypertension and diabetes.  Assessment: A physical exam found facial droop on the right side  right arm drift  and slurred speech which suggest left hemispheric stroke. The total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 15  indicating moderate severity.  Investigations: A CT scan showed a large  acute ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Carotid duplex showed significant stenosis on the left side. EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation.   Discussion: The patient's profile  symptoms and investigation findings confirm that Mr. Smith suffered an ischemic stroke. His age  gender  ethnicity  and medical history (hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  previous heart attack  family history of stroke) place him in the high-risk category for stroke. His poor medication compliance and lifestyle choices (smoking  unhealthy diet) have further compounded his risk.  Management: Mr. Smith was managed with thrombolytic therapy (intravenous alteplase). After the acute phase  he will require stroke rehabilitation for his right-sided weakness and speech issues  along with secondary prevention measures to control his blood pressure  blood sugar  and cholesterol levels. Lifestyle modifications will be recommended  including smoking cessation  healthy diet  adequate physical exercise  and medication adherence. Additionally  he will be referred for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation. Psychological support and social service involvement will be crucial considering he lives alone.  This brief case presentation highlights the significance of multidimensional risk factors in the development of a stroke and emphasizes the importance of prevention strategies and adherence to treatment regimens in high-risk individuals.
Stroke,9,98,Case Presentation:  Patient: Ms. Maria  a 68-year-old  retired Hispanic female  was brought to the emergency room following complaints of sudden onset of severe headache  dizziness  right-sided weakness  and difficulty in speech for the past 2 hours. She is a resident of Los Angeles  lives with her husband  has two adult children  and four grandchildren.  Past Medical History: Maria has been living with type-2 diabetes for 15 years  is also hypertensive  and presents with a history of intermittent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat). Her hypertension and diabetes have been quite well-managed with regular medications and diet. She suffers from occasional migraines. Maria is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol in moderation. However  she has a sedentary lifestyle due to her retirement and has a BMI in the overweight category.  Family History: There is a significant family history of stroke  with her mother experiencing a stroke at age 72. Moreover  both her parents had type-2 diabetes and hypertension. Her younger brother  aged 65  also suffers from type-2 diabetes.   Stroke Characteristics: The sudden onset of her symptoms and their nature suggests a potential ischemic stroke  possibly due to the presence of atrial fibrillation and subsequent clot formation. Maria's ongoing migraines may also be a risk factor. She hasn't had any previous minor strokes or transient ischemic attacks nor any signs of other neurological disorders.  Investigations: Upon initial examination  she was found to have a high blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg  a high blood sugar level  and irregular heartbeats were observed. Neurological deficits on the right side were also noted. She was sent for an immediate CT scan which confirmed the presence of an ischemic stroke.   Treatment and Plan: She was immediately administered intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  a clot-dissolving medication. The neurologist recommended initiating antihypertensive and anticoagulant treatment to manage her risk factors alongside the prescribed diabetic medication. She will be further evaluated for carotid artery disease and possible cardioembolism from atrial fibrillation.  Follow-ups and Rehabilitation: Maria will require frequent follow-ups  close monitoring of her vitals  blood sugar level  and heart rhythms. Speech and physical therapists have been consulted to deal with her speech difficulties and right-sided weakness. She has been advised to keep a low-sodium  low-sugar diet  increase physical activity  and to manage her weight for long-term stroke prevention.  Given her family history of stroke and her ongoing cardiovascular  neurovascular  and endocrine risk factors  it would be vital to implement an aggressive secondary stroke prevention strategy to avoid recurrence of strokes later for Maria. Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications upon discharge will be crucial in achieving this goal.
Stroke,9,99,Patient Information:  Mr. Brown  a 67-year-old African-American male presented with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking. He also reported experiencing a severe headache. Mr. Brown is retired and lives with his wife. His past medical history mentioned hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and smoking.  His younger brother had a stroke in his early 60s  and his father died from a heart attack at 70. Mr. Brown has also been a regular smoker for the past 40 years  and he consumes alcohol occasionally. Despite his knowledge of his brother's and father's conditions  he hasn’t taken regular steps towards preventative health behavior due to fear of knowing his health status.  Clinical Findings: Presenting symptoms included confusion  trouble speaking  and difficulty walking  all more pronounced on the right side of the body. His blood pressure at admission was 180/95 mm Hg  a glucose level of 260 mg/dL  and a BMI classified him as overweight.  Clinical Management: The patient was admitted to the hospital  and a CT scan was performed revealing a left-hemisphere stroke. Antithrombotic treatment was started immediately and his blood pressure and glucose levels are managed with antihypertensives and insulin respectively. Physiotherapy was also initiated after 24 hours for muscle strengthening and balance. His smoking cessation was also addressed as a concern.  Discussion:  Stroke affects a significant portion of the elderly population  with a higher prevalence in African American males  and is commonly associated with hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and family history of stroke/heart attacks  as seen in this case. Mr. Brown's fear of knowing his health status  which led to lack of preventive behavior  illustrates the need for more outreach and education in at-risk communities.  This case serves to emphasize the importance of early recognition and therapeutic intervention in reducing the disability and mortality associated with stroke. It also points towards the necessity for educating patients and breaking down barriers that lead to avoidance of health monitoring and preventative care.   Moreover  maintaining a healthy diet  incorporating regular exercise into one’s routine  abandoning unhealthy habits such as smoking  and ensuring regular health check-ups for managing hypertension and diabetes can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Thus  comprehensive care should not only target treatment but also involve prevention strategies and patient education.   Conclusion: In conclusion  this case showed an African American male presenting with an acute stroke with high-risk factors for the same  underlining the connection between lifestyle  genetic predisposition  and stroke occurrence. The case also highlighted the necessity of regular check-ups  lifestyle modifications  and early interventions in reducing health risks. 
Stroke,9,100,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:   Mr. P  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints of sudden-onset difficulty speaking and left-sided weakness. Residing in a suburban environment  Mr. P is a retired automobile mechanic living with his wife.  Demographics:   His socioeconomic status is middle class  and he is insured. The patient has a 30-pack year smoking history. His BMI is 28.8  indicating overweight status. He admits occasional alcohol use but denies illicit drug usage.  Medical History:  Mr. P has a past medical history significant for hypertension diagnosed ten years ago and hyperlipidemia  which was diagnosed approximately five years ago. Both conditions have been moderately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin  respectively. His primary care physician recorded multiple instances of non-compliance with his medication. Mr. P has no known allergies. His surgical history is unremarkable.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at 67  and his mother died of stroke at the age of 75. The patient has two adult children both alive and healthy. The family history is negative for any inheritable genetic disorders.  Clinical Findings:  On arrival to the ER  patient was disoriented with expressive aphasia. Mr.P demonstrated left facial droop  arm drift and abnormal speech  scoring a 12 on the NIH Stroke Scale. His blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm  and a CT scan of the head showed a right middle cerebral artery occlusion.   Diagnosis:   Concerns for an ischemic stroke was evident based on symptoms and imaging  so the neurology team was immediately notified. Patient fell within the window for intravenous thrombolytic therapy.  This case represents the stereotypical stroke patient who may be seen in the emergency department. Factors like age  male gender  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  overweight status  and a family history of cardiovascular disease are all well-established risk factors for stroke. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of aggressive risk factor management and patient compliance in preventing catastrophic incidents like a stroke.  References: 1.

Stroke,10,1,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Jackson Mills  a 68-year-old African-American man  is brought to the emergency department. The patient is a retired bank manager  lives with his wife  and has three adult children. He is a non-smoker but has a history of occasional alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Mills has a known history of essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes. These conditions have been controlled through a regimen of ACE inhibitors and Metformin for the past 10 years  respectively. He also has hyperlipidemia  for which he has been taking statins for the last 7 years. No known history of cardiac diseases  but his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72.   Key Complaints: Mr. Mills was watching television when he suddenly began to feel a severe headache  described as the worst in his life. His wife noted that he became confused and was having difficulty speaking  along with a noticeable drooping of the right side of his face. His wife also reported that Mr. Mills had trouble walking and demonstrated weakness in his right arm. Upon noting these sudden changes (all happening within the last hour)  she called an ambulance.  This case represents a typical scenario of an acute ischemic stroke  which is higher in African-Americans  males  and individuals with a family history of stroke. Hypertension and diabetes are significant stroke risk factors  as is hyperlipidemia. While a more detailed history  physical examination  and diagnostic tests are key to confirm this diagnosis  based on these demographics  history  and presenting clinical features  stroke should be high up in differential diagnoses for emergent management.
Stroke,10,2,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Juan Morales  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  lives with his wife in the urban area. He has recently quit smoking after a 30-year pack-per-day history. He consumes alcohol occasionally. He has a family history of heart disease  with his father dying of a myocardial infarction at age 72  and mother suffering from hypertension. He has no outdoor hobbies or activities  and spends most of his time indoor reading or watching TV.   Past Medical History: The patient is known to have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. His blood pressure is often recorded high during his regular outpatient check-ups  suggesting untreated hypertension. His body mass index (BMI) is 27.3 (overweight)  which ensembles a sedentary lifestyle. He is non-compliant with diabetic medications and quite irregular with follow-ups. He has no known drug allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Morales was brought to the emergency room by his wife after witnessing him suddenly slump on his chair during breakfast. She reported that he had difficulty speaking  a drooping face on the right side and was unable to lift his right arm. The patient was barely conscious when arrived at the ER. These symptoms commenced roughly 1 hour before arrival. His wife also mentioned that Mr. Morales complained of a severe headache and confusion few minutes before the event. She denied any history of trauma  seizure  or loss of consciousness.   This succinct case represents many risk factors for stroke  including age  smoking history  lack of exercise  poor diabetic control  and unidentified hypertension. An acute onset of neurological findings may suggest stroke  providing an excellent opportunity for students to learn about rapid evaluation  diagnostic techniques  treatment strategies and the importance of secondary prevention in high-risk individuals. Additionally  it emphasizes health education and preventive measures in at-risk communities  underlining the importance of medication adherence and regular follow-ups.
Stroke,10,3,Patient Case: Mr. Johnson  Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African American male who is a retired senior accountant  living with his spouse in an urban area. He is a non-smoker but has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He also has a family history of stroke; his father suffered a stroke at the age of 70.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been compliant with his oral medications for type 2 diabetes and hypertension for the last 15 years. He has no known allergies. The rest of his past medical history is unremarkable.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty in swallowing that began approximately two hours prior to hospital arrival. He further complained of a headache and stated that his vision was blurry. There were no reported symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.   Note: This case highlights an individual at high risk of ischemic stroke which is seen often in the clinical setting. It's crucial to teach future medical professionals that African Americans are disproportionately affected by strokes  and those with diabetes  hypertension  and family history are particularly at risk. The symptoms experienced by Mr. Johnson are classic for stroke and every medical professional should be trained to recognize them promptly for immediate intervention. His background as an accountant adds to the stress-related triggers often associated with cerebrovascular incidents.
Stroke,10,4,Title: The Case of Unexpected Left-Side Weakness    Patient Demographics: Mr. J is a 68-year-old African American male who was independently living alone  though his daughter is staying nearby. He is a retired school teacher with a moderate financial status.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a documented history of hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled by medication (Losartan). His compliance to medication is inconsistent  as reported by his daughter. Mr. J is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. Further  there is a family history of stroke and heart conditions. He had an occasional bout of headaches  considered to be tension-type. He has no known allergies to medications.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. J was brought into the hospital by his daughter. She reported that she received a call from him in the morning where he was speaking unclearly with a slurred speech. Upon reaching his house  she noticed that his face was slightly drooped to the right side  and he was having difficulty moving his left arm and leg. He complained of a severe  sudden headache and dizziness. There was no reported loss of consciousness  chest pain  or palpitation.   The episode started approximately 3 hours before the arrival to the Emergency Department. Mr. J had also noticed dark stools in the past week which he did not report.   This briefing case represents the realities of stroke patients as per literature in several ways. First  it accounts for the higher prevalence of stroke in men and increases with age  particularly after 65 years. African Americans have a significantly higher risk of having a stroke than Caucasians. Hypertension is a notable risk factor  and this case also considers non-compliance as a common issue in chronic disease management.   Please note: This is simply a simulated case  designed for educational purposes  to help medical students enhance their diagnostic skills in clinical practice.
Stroke,10,5,Patient Case Details:  Patient: Mr. David Lee Age: 67 years  Gender: Male Race: Asian-American Occupation: Retired high school teacher Marital status: Married  Past Medical History:  Mr. Lee has been hypertensive for the past 15 years  which he manages with antihypertensive medication. He also has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago  and he is currently on metformin. His cholesterol levels have been moderately high throughout the years  but he has been noncompliant with the recommended lifestyle changes and statin therapy. He has a 40-year history of smoking  although he quit 2 years ago. His father died due to a stroke in his early seventies.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Lee presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech and difficulty finding the right words  and loss of balance. These symptoms persisted for more than 2 hours and began while he was having breakfast. He also reported a sudden  severe headache.   Key Points to Consider:  - Age  race  and gender significantly influence stroke risk. The prevalence of stroke is relatively higher among older adults  males  and people from minority racial and ethnic backgrounds. - Major risk factors for stroke include hypertension  diabetes  raised cholesterol levels  smoking  and family history of stroke. - The presence of multiple risk factors can exponentially enhance the risk of stroke. - The sudden onset of symptoms such as unilateral weakness  speech slurring  difficulty finding the right words  and severe headache are strong offerings of stroke. - Early recognition  immediate action  and timely management can significantly improve the prognosis and minimize disability for the patient.  Students can follow the progress of Mr. Lee’s case to learn about the diagnosis  management  and potential complications of stroke. They should consider the elements of stroke prevention  the importance of patient education  and necessary lifestyle modifications. It can also provide a broader exploration of health disparities and social determinants of health.   Acknowledging that each stroke patient has unique clinical circumstances  students should aim to devise individualized treatment strategies and consider the adverse social and psychological impacts on the patient and caregiver. 
Stroke,10,6,Case Study: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. James Rodriguez Age : 65 years Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Urban area Socioeconomic Status: Middle Income   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez visited the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of weakness on the right side of his body  difficulty in speech and a recent episode of severe headache that occurred while watching television at home.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has history of Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years. His hypertension is usually well controlled on medication (Lisinopril). His Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) was found to be slightly elevated in his last general check-up three months ago suggesting sub-optimal glycemic control. He used to smoke a pack of cigarettes daily until five years ago and also has family history of stroke with his father having suffered from one at the age of 70.  Demographic relevance: According to literature  stroke is more common in men than in women and the risk of stroke doubles every decade after the age of 55  with Hispanic population at a higher risk. Hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus  smoking  and family history are major risk factors for stroke.  Key Learning points: Early recognition of symptoms  Risk factors of Stroke  Importance of blood pressure and glycemic control. Teaching Modules: Skills for neurological assessment  management of Acute Ischemic Stroke  Rehabilitative care in stroke.  References: 1. Go AS  Mozaffarian D  Roger VL  et al.

Stroke,10,7,Case Report:  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male named George with socio-economic status placing him in the middle-class range. He has a work background in construction and is recently retired.  Past Medical History: George has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago). Despite multiple initiatives from his primary care physician  George has been non-compliant with his medications and lifestyle modifications. He has a pack-a-day smoking history for the past 40 years but quit five years ago. He does not consume alcohol. His family history includes a father who suffered from a stroke at the age of 70.  Key Complaints: George visited the emergency department accompanied by his wife. He presented with the primary complaints of sudden-onset right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started approximately 2 hours prior to presentation. He denied any loss of consciousness  seizure  or trauma. He also reported a severe headache.  This case has been designed considering the demographics that show a higher incidence of stroke in individuals over the age of 60  African Americans  and those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. Non-compliance with treatment also increases the risk. These demographics and risk factors are consistent with the epidemiological trends found in the literature regarding stroke.
Stroke,10,8,Case Report:  Patient Information:  - Age: 64 years old - Sex: Male - Race: African-American - Occupation: Retired electrician - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Medical records indicate that these conditions have been fairly well managed via diet  medication  and regular check-ups for over a decade. The patient has a 20-pack year smoking history but quit approximately 5 years ago. He has a family history of stroke with his mother suffering from an ischemic stroke at the age of 70. Further details of his past medical history have been unremarkable.   Key Complaints:  The patient reported sudden onset of symptoms. He experienced severe headache  left-sided weakness  difficulty in speech  slurred speech  and difficulty in understanding verbal communication. He also mentions a sudden loss of balance and coordination  with a recent episode of stumbling while attempting to walk. The patient's wife reported that his mouth seemed to droop/resemble a grimace on the left side when he was trying to speak.  Please note that this case report is representative of a stroke and aligned to the most common stroke demographics in literature. Stroke incidence is higher among males and risk increases with age. African-Americans have a significantly higher risk of stroke compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Diabetes and smoking further compound this risk. Sudden onset of headaches  left-sided weakness  difficulties with speech and balance  and facial drooping are common symptoms of stroke. 
Stroke,10,9,Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 79-year-old African-American male  living in an urban community  and retired as a school principal. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  two of the most frequently reported comorbidities in stroke patients.  Presenting Complain:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of right-sided facial drooping  dysarthria (difficulty in articulating words)  and hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body). He was also experiencing sudden dizziness and a severe headache  characteristic symptoms of ischemic stroke.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. He is also known to have hypertension for which he has been taking Lisinopril for the last 10 years. He has a history of smoking (one pack/day for 40 years) but quit 5 years ago. The patient has no previous history of stroke or myocardial infarction  but a family history of stroke is present (his father).  Key Complaints:  The main complaints that led his spouse to bring him to the ER were:  1. Sudden right-sided facial droopiness  2. Trouble speaking and slurred speech  3. Right-sided body weakness  4. Sudden severe headache with no known cause  and 5. Dizziness.  Considerations:  Given the patient demographics  past medical history  and presenting complaints  there is considerable concern for acute ischemic stroke  probably due to a thrombus or embolus. The history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  two significant risk factors for stroke  along with presenting symptoms  warrant immediate attention and neurological evaluation. Time is crucial in these cases because the faster the intervention  the lower the risk of long-term neurological deficit or death.
Stroke,10,10,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. James is a 67-year-old African American retired school teacher residing in Kansas City  Missouri. He has been living with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for twenty years and Hypertension for fifteen years. He is a non-smoker but had a history of heavy drinking  which he discontinued five years ago. He lives with his wife in a suburban area and has two kids who live out of state. His BMI is 30  indicating obesity.  Key Complaints:   On January 15th  2023  Mr. James was brought to a nearby emergency department by his wife. She reported a sudden onset of speech difficulty and asymmetric weakness on the right side of the body while having dinner  which started approximately 1 hour ago. The patient also complained about feeling dizzy and the severe headache that began around the same time. Prior to this  he had been doing his daily activities normally with no signs of illness.  Background Information:  Mr. James’ existing conditions of diabetes and hypertension signify a predisposition to cerebrovascular events  such as stroke. His age  race (Africans Americans are known to have a higher risk of stroke)  and obesity are also relevant risk factors  as reflected in the literature. Additionally  his previous alcohol use may have had long-term effects even after discontinuation.  Justification:  This case accurately represents a classic clinical scenario of an ischemic stroke represented by the typical symptoms of rapid onset of focal neurologic deficits localized to a specific vascular distribution and is in line with the demographics and risk factors identified in stroke literature. As a teaching case  this scenario highlights the importance of promptly identifying stroke symptoms and the role of risk factors in developing disease. It also emphasizes the significance of primary care interventions in managing chronic diseases to prevent complications like stroke.
Stroke,10,11,Case Study: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics:  Patient Initials: J.D. Age: 68 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired factory worker Location: Urban Neighborhood  Past Medical History: J.D. is a former smoker with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease. He takes antihypertensive medications and oral hypoglycemics regularly.  Presenting Complaints: J.D. was brought to the emergency department by his daughter who had found him with slurred speech and weakness in his right arm and leg. The onset was sudden when he woke up. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.   Other Key Information: His daughter reported that she had checked in with him at 7 pm the previous night and he had seemed perfectly fine.  Relevance of Case Study for Medical Education: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S and a leading cause of disability. African Americans are disproportionately affected  with nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared to white populations. Hypertension  smoking  diabetes  and heart disease are significant factors that can contribute to stroke  and are more prevalent in African American populations. J.D.'s case can explore these risk factors and the subsequent impact on stroke incidence and outcomes. It also provides an opportunity to discuss sudden onset of neurological symptoms  FAST (Face  Arms  Speech  Time) signs of stroke  and the importance of quick response.

She noticed an onset of blurred vision and difficulty speaking  persisting for approximately 2 hours. She also reported a mild to moderate headache over the same period. With assistance from her daughter  she was brought to the emergency department.  The case presented adheres to the fact that higher stroke prevalence is often found in individuals over age 65  those with comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes  and in African American population. The modifiable risk factors in this scenario also underline the importance of lifestyle management  smoking cessation and regular health check-ups for prevention of stroke.
Stroke,10,13,Patient Profile: Case: Ms. Fatima Sanchez Age: 65 years Sex: Female Race: Hispanic  Past Medical History: Hypertension for 15 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  dyslipidemia  former smoker (quit 10 years ago)  and history of a transient ischemic attack 5 years ago. She denies any surgical history. Family history reveals that her father had a stroke at the age of 70. She is currently taking Lisinopril  Metformin  and Statins as an outpatient.  Presentation: Ms. Sanchez arrives at the emergency room around 12:00 PM. She complains of a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurring of speech  which started approximately at 9:00 AM the same day while she was reading the newspaper. She denies any headache  change in vision  nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness. She also reports having some difficulty swallowing. There are no injuries due to a fall.  Physical Examination: Ms. Sanchez is alert but anxious. Vitals: BP 160/85mmHg  pulse rate 86 beats per minute  and respirations 18 breaths per minute. She has an existing loss of motor function on her face's left side (drooping of the left side of her mouth)  arm  and leg. Her speech is slurred  and she has difficulty swallowing. No sensory disturbances are noted.  This case points towards a medical emergency  likely a stroke. The sudden onset of left-sided weakness  slurred speech and difficulty swallowing possibly indicates right-hemispheric stroke. Her underlying conditions (hypertension  diabetes  history of TIA) all confer an elevated risk for stroke. A rapid stroke workup is necessary  including neuroimaging  hematological and coagulation tests. Immediate medical intervention is essential to prevent exacerbation and potentially  reverse neurological deficits. This training case could be used to teach medical students about acute stroke presentation and management  and reinforce understanding of the relevance of risk factors.
Stroke,10,14,Case Report:  Patient: Mr. C.J.   Demographics: Mr. C.J is a 69-year-old African American male living in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired engineer with two grown-up children and four grandchildren. He is a widower and currently lives alone.   Past Medical History:  Mr. C.J. has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are being managed with antihypertensive medications and statins respectively. His hypertension has been under inconsistent control  with some recorded readings showing that his blood pressure occasionally spikes above the target range. Mr. C.J. is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but with a 30-pack-year history before that. He has a known allergy to penicillin.  Key Complaints:  Mr. C.J. presents to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of sudden  severe headache  slurred speech  face drooping on one side  and weakness in his right arm and leg. This occurred while he was doing his early morning household chores. He also reports minor confusion and trouble walking due to imbalance. He denies any loss of consciousness  visual changes  or any similar incidence earlier.  Reason for Considering: The patient's symptoms and history are indicative of a possible Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). In the US  stroke most frequently affects older adults  with the median age for first stroke at approximately 74 for men. African American populations are largely predisposed to stroke  with a higher incidence rate compared to any other race. Other risk factors like hypertension  dyslipidemia  smoking  obesity  physical inactivity  and the use of hypertensive medication  especially in African Americans  warrant this condition’s significant likelihood. This case is a key opportunity for medical students to study and manage this crucial  time-sensitive condition. In terms of management focus  it is essential to explore the ABCD2 score  NIH stroke scale  proper examination  prompt imaging techniques  and potential therapeutic approaches such as thrombolysis and neurosurgical interventions.
Stroke,10,15,Patient Details: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: African-American Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: Hypertension  Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hyperlipidaemia  Mild Obesity  Previous Smoker (quit 5 years back)  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson visited the emergency department accompanied by his wife  reporting a sudden onset of left limb weakness  difficulty in speaking (slurred speech)  and imbalance while walking that occurred approximately an hour ago. He also experienced a severe headache and episodes of confusion.  Review of these symptoms is consistent with signs of potential stroke. As stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and higher in African Americans due to increased prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes  Mr. Johnson’s case fits into the seen demographics and highlights potentially key learning points about recognizing the symptoms of stroke and providing immediate medical attention.  Note: This is a brief case for teaching purposes  outlining a realistic yet hypothetical patient scenario. To further develop the scenario as part of a comprehensive case study  additional information such as family history  social history  medication history  physical examination findings  investigation results  management specifics  and follow-up plan could be compiled.
Stroke,10,16,Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male. He is a retired plumber  a widower  and currently living with his eldest daughter.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed by medications. Additionally  he has been a smoker for nearly 45 years and drinks alcohol socially. He also has a family history of stroke. The patient is non-compliant with diet and exercise.  Chief Complaints: He presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of difficulty speaking  weakness on the right side of his body that started while he was having breakfast this morning. The patient's family also noted that he seemed confused  with some struggle to understand them  and noted a droop on the right side of his face.  Reason for Visit: The patient's daughter brought him to the emergency department  afraid that he might be having a stroke based upon the sudden changes and his family history. His last known normal was approximately 3 hours prior to reaching the hospital.  This case report provides a prototype patient at high risk for stoke: an African-American male over 65 with hypertension  diabetes  a smoking history  and a family history of stroke. It is important to note African-Americans have almost twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared to Caucasians  and individuals with the aforementioned risk factors are at greater risk. The common signs of stroke (Face drooping  Arm weakness  Speech difficulty) that prompt immediate medical attention are also presented.
Stroke,10,17,Case Report: Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male  retired  with a primary residence in an urban area. He was widowed 6 years ago and currently lives alone. His daughter and her family live nearby and they visit him regularly.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 12 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years  and was diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 5 years ago. He has been compliant with his anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications  but has been inconsistent with his anticoagulation therapy. He quit smoking 7 years ago but has a significant past history of 30 pack years. He does not consume alcohol.   Key Complaints: The patient's daughter found him in bed  conscious but unable to speak clearly  and with his right side appearing weak. The symptoms had apparently begun when she called him over an hour ago  and he sounded 'funny' over the phone. On arrival  she realized her father had slurred speech  and was not moving his right arm and leg. He seemed confused and scared. Knowing his medical history  she suspected these could be signs of stroke and called the EMS.   Note: Demographically  this case considers that stroke risks increase with age  is higher in men  and African Americans have nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with whites. Epidemiologically  hypertension  atrial fibrillation  diabetes  smoking  and male sex are significant risk factors for stroke. The scenario also emphasizes the delay in seeking medical attention seen commonly in stroke patients  which is a vital component affecting prognosis.
Stroke,10,18,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male from downtown Cleveland  Ohio. He is a retired high school teacher  living with his wife in their family home. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He exercises moderately at home and his BMI is within the healthy range.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with medication (Lisinopril). He has type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes Metformin. There is no previous record of surgeries or hospitalizations. He has no known allergies. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases; his father suffered a myocardial infarction at age 72.   Key Complaints: The patient was brought to the Emergency Department by his wife when he suddenly began experiencing a severe headache  slurred speech  and right-sided weakness. His symptoms started while he was taking a walk in the park. The wife also mentioned that he had been complaining about intermittent episodes of blurred vision for the past week but dismissed it as a minor issue.  Note: This case has been designed to highlight a typical patient who might present with stroke  taking into account epidemiological data that shows high stroke incidence among African American males and those who have a history of hypertension and diabetes. In the United States  stroke ranks fifth among all causes of death and is more likely to affect African Americans than any other race or ethnicity. Additionally  hypertension and diabetes are recognized major risk factors for stroke. This case deliberately incorporates these elements to stimulate discussion around differential diagnosis  appropriate management  and strategies for stroke prevention in high-risk patients.
Stroke,10,19,Patient Information:   Mr. Shridhar  67 years old male  Asian-Indian descent  retired software engineer  nonsmoker  living with his wife in the suburbs of Bangalore  India.  Past Medical History:   He has been managing hypertension for the past 10 years  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 7 years. He also had an ischemic heart disease (IHD) diagnosis around 5 years ago. He maintains an active lifestyle  but his diet consists of moderately high consumption of salt  fats  and sugars.  Presenting Complaints:   The patient was brought to the emergency department by relatives after he was reportedly found to have sudden confusion  slurred speech  and deviation of the mouth to the left side. He was also apparently having difficulty moving his right arm and leg. Pill bottles for his prescribed medications (Metformin  Lisinopril  and a statin) next to an empty coffee cup suggested that he was having his breakfast when the onset occurred. The relatives estimated that symptoms started about 1.5 to 2 hours before presentation to the hospital.  Outline of the Training Case:  1. Gather patient's history 2. Focus on symptom analysis to understand the onset and duration  and to gauge the severity of the stroke. 3. Explore the risk factors contributing to stroke such as hypertension  diabetes  being of Asian descent  history of IHD  and diet. 4. Conduct physical examination  involving a focussed neurological exam. 5. Talk about possible diagnostic tests to be considered like imaging (CT Scan/ MRI) and laboratory tests. 6. Discuss appropriate treatment options and urgency of care respecting the 'time is brain' principle. 7. Discuss primary and secondary prevention such as lifestyle changes and medications to manage underlying conditions.  Learning Goals:  Understanding the early signs of a stroke  significance of time in management  importance of managing risk factors  and focusing on strategies to prevent recurrent stroke.
Stroke,10,20,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Jackson is a 68-year-old African American male. He is a retired automobile factory worker  a widower  and resides in a suburban community in Detroit  Michigan. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol infrequently.  Past Medical History: His medical history shows hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are common risk factors for stroke among African Americans. He was consistent in taking antihypertensive and diabetic medications until recently when there was a decline in his compliance. He also has a family history of stroke. Other notable previous history includes a minor heart attack five years ago where angioplasty was performed.  Key Complaints: Patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset difficulty in speaking  altered consciousness  and right-sided weakness which began approximately two hours from his arrival. He has a BP of 165/95mmHg  BSL 210mg/dL  and cholesterol level of 250mg/dL which are not in optimal control and are potential contributors to his current status.  Key Learning Points: The case will focus on the pathophysiology  presentation  and treatment of stroke  with an emphasis on the importance of urgent medical attention  rapid and accurate diagnosis  and initiation of appropriate therapy. Special emphasis should be given to managing and recognizing potential complications  understanding the role of long-term preventive strategies  managing comorbid conditions like hypertension  and diabetes which are associated with a higher incidence of stroke. Additionally  the disparity of stroke prevalence among different races should be highlighted  stressing the need for personalized care and preventive strategies.  Subsequent sessions will include stroke rehabilitation  integrated care  patient education on lifestyle modification  medication compliance  and regular follow-ups to ensure optimal blood pressure and sugar management. Communication with the patient and family members during the course of stroke care emphasizing shared decision-making would be a crucial part of the training.
Stroke,10,21,Case: Middle Cerebral Artery Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics:  Mrs. Barbara Smith  African American woman  68 years old. Lives in an assisted living community. High School graduate  retired office administrator. Widow with 2 adult children and 4 grandchildren. Non-smoker  occasional drinker.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - diagnosed 15 years ago  poorly controlled. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - diagnosed 10 years ago  under control with medication. 3. Hyperlipidemia - diagnosed 7 years ago  on medication. 4. History of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) 3 years ago. 5. No known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Smith was rushed to the emergency department after staff found her unable to move her right arm and leg and speak properly. The onset was sudden while she was having breakfast. She was noted to have mild cognitive impairment in recent months  however  was independent for most of her daily activities. On examination  there is a clear asymmetry in her face  more noticeable when she smiles showing drooping on the right side. Her speech is slurred. There are no signs of trauma.  NOTE: This case attempts to present an accurate demographic representation  referring to literature indicating that certain demographics including advanced age  female gender  and African American ethnicity  are associated with a higher risk for stroke. It also mentions hypertension and diabetes as they are common comorbidities associated with stroke. The case underlines that age  race  and other factors can influence a patient's risk of illnesses and also highlights the role of a caregiver in observing and responding to sudden changes in health status. The case aims to provide medical students with the opportunity to apply clinical reasoning skills to diagnose and manage stroke  utilizing patient’s history  clinical examinations  and potential investigations keeping in mind the demographic details.   *It's crucial to clarify that while there's literature linking race and stroke risk  it's likely more associated with socioeconomic factors including access to care  diet  and stress  rather than purely based on race/ethnicity. Making these clarifications helps to avoid potential harm from racial essentialism in medical education.
Stroke,10,22,Case Description:  Patient Information: Ms. Angela Ross  a 70-year-old African-American woman  recently retired  came with her daughter to the Emergency Department.  Past Medical History: Ms. Ross has a history of hypertension (for the past 12 years)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (for the past 10 years)  and dyslipidemia. She is a non-smoker. Her medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. She has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaints: Her daughter noticed Ms. Ross suddenly started having difficulty speaking  slurring her words  and became unable to lift her right arm while they were having dinner  approximately 2 hours ago.   Symptom Analysis:  There was no heartburn or chest discomfort. Ms. Ross didn't have this kind of event before. There are no known incidences of similar conditions in the family.  This training case corresponds to the demographics typically affected by strokes (the elderly  females  and African-Americans). It also highlights major risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia). The presenting symptoms suggest an acute cerebrovascular event pointing towards a possible ischemic stroke. The case does not necessarily represent all strokes  but covers aspects most relevant for medical students - familiarizing themselves with high-risk populations  recognizing key symptoms  and understanding the importance of the timeline in these circumstances.
Stroke,10,23,Patient Profile:  Name: Maria Rodriguez Age: 74 Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Location: Miami  Florida  Past Medical History:   Ms. Rodriguez is a known case of Hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with Amlodipine 5 mg/day. She has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the last ten years  managed with Metformin 500mg twice a day. She does not smoke but drinks wine 1-2 glasses per week. Her family history reveals her mother had an ischemic stroke at the age of 82.  Chief Complaints:  Ms. Rodriguez presented to the emergency department with her daughter  reporting a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking  which occurred while she was having breakfast around 2 hours ago. She also reports confusion and a sudden severe headache.  Note:   According to the literature  stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S  and Hispanic population is at a higher risk for stroke compared to Non-Hispanic whites. Across both genders  stroke risk increases with age  particularly after age 65. Common risk factors include hypertension  diabetes  alcohol consumption  smoking  and family history of stroke. Therefore  the profile has been designed to reflect accurate demographic representation and associated risk factors.
Stroke,10,24,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mrs. A is a 70-year-old African American female living in a suburban community. She is a retired school teacher  currently lives with her husband and is socially active in her community. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She has a BMI of 28 indicating overweight according to the WHO standards.   Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medications. She had been diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago and is under medication. Also  a past record of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) was noted three years back.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. A was brought by her husband to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided body weakness and facial droop. He noticed that her speech was slurred and she was having trouble maintaining her balance. These symptoms were first noticed about 2 hours before coming to the hospital. No loss of consciousness  seizure  or severe headaches were reported. There were no visual changes or difficulties in swallowing.   This fictional case is representative of the typical stroke patient profile  given that African American females have higher stroke rates compared with other races and gender combinations. This demographic is also at higher risk for hypertension  diabetes  and overweight  all significant risk factors contributing to strokes. This risk escalation is especially noticeable after age 65.

Presenting Complaints: Mr. Thompson reports experiencing sudden-onset weakness on the right side of his body (including his face  arm  and leg)  difficulty speaking  and trouble maintaining balance. He also complains of severe headache and fleeting episodes of dizziness over the past hour.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Additionally  he has been a heavy smoker for about 30 years and has a family history of stroke  with his father passing away from one at the age of 70. He is currently on antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications.  Social History:  He is a retired salesman  lives with his wife  and has a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. He admits to drinking on social occasions but denies substance abuse.  Note: The choice for an African American subject was made due to their increased risk of getting a stroke  which is almost twice as much compared to Caucasians according to an American Heart Association report. The case exhibits factors such as family history  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and older age  which are well-documented risk factors for stroke.
Stroke,10,26,"Case Report:  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Alberto Gonzalez.  Age: 62 years. Sex: Male. Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic. Occupation: Recently retired  former truck driver.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Gonzalez arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset left-sided weakness. His wife  who was present  stated that he had a transient episode of slurred speech earlier in the day. Additionally  Mr. Gonzalez experienced fleeting visual changes including a sensation of """"shadowy"""" vision in his left eye.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Gonzalez has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are both controlled with medication. He has a history of smoking  but quit ten years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol intake and a generally sedentary lifestyle. He has no previous history of strokes or any other neurological disorders. His family history includes a brother who suffered a stroke at a relatively younger age.  This comprehensive case emulates an authentic potential experience with stroke in real-world medical practice. Hispanic individuals  like Mr. Gonzalez  are signficantly more likely to experience a stroke than their non-Hispanic counterparts. Additionally  key risk factors for stroke such as age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking history  and family history are all included.    Use this case to prompt medical students to consider differential diagnoses  interpret investigative results  decide appropriate management  and understand the importance of lifestyle modification in disease prevention. Further discussion could encompass cultural and social factors which may influence healthcare outcomes in stroke patients."
Stroke,10,27,Case Study: Ischemic Stroke  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Gloria DaSilva   Age: 68   Gender: Female   Ethnicity: Hispanic   Occupation: Retired schoolteacher    Past Medical History: Mrs. DaSilva has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. She has been on medication for these conditions for the last 12 years. She also has a 20-year history of cigarette smoking (up to one pack/day) but quit five years ago. No significant family history of stroke or other cardiovascular diseases. She has a BMI of 29 with an inactive lifestyle and uncontrolled diet.  Key Complaints: Mrs. DaSilva presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of speech disturbances and right arm weakness that started approximately one and a half hours prior to her arrival. She also complained about experiencing headache and dizziness. In addition  she noticed having difficulty in understanding what her grandson was saying to her. Her symptoms didn't improve at all till she arrived at the hospital.  Discussion: This case represents a typical presentation of an ischemic stroke which is the most common type of stroke. Mrs. DaSilva's demographic information and her medical history correlate with the literature  demonstrating higher incidence rates of stroke in those over 60  with a history of hypertension  diabetes  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and in certain ethnic groups. Additionally  women have a higher lifetime risk of having a stroke.
Stroke,10,28,Case Report: Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics:   Mr. Rodriguez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male  living with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired civil engineer and spends most of his time gardening and volunteering at a local community center.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has hypertension controlled by medication for the past ten years  and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago. He was a smoker for about 20 years  but quit 15 years ago. There is no known family history of stroke. His BMI is slightly over the upper limit of normal.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez came to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset of weakness in his right arm and leg  slurred speech  and difficulty swallowing which he experienced while gardening. He also reported a mild headache.   The symptoms occurred approximately ninety minutes prior to his arrival at the hospital. His wife immediately called an ambulance when she noticed him struggling and witnessed his slurred speech and facial droop on the right side.  This case represents a high-risk demographic for ischemic stroke as per literature. It is common in older individuals  men  and those with diabetes  hypertension  and a history of smoking. Even though Mr. Rodriguez quit smoking  the risk of stroke remains higher compared with non-smokers. Hispanics are also reported to have a high burden of stroke. Careful conversation about the risk factors and immediate measures taken in response to presenting symptoms is crucial in managing ischemic stroke.
Stroke,10,29,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 70-year-old African American male  Past Medical History: The patient has a longstanding history of hypertension  managed by medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). He has had type 2 diabetes for 10 years  which is semi-controlled with oral hypoglycemics (Metformin). He is a former smoker  having smoked about one pack of cigarettes per day for 35 years before quitting 10 years ago. He drinks socially and denies any illicit drug use. His father died of complications from stroke at age 75  and his mother had a history of heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department by his daughter who noticed his slurred speech and right-sided facial droop. The patient complained of sudden onset of weakness in the right side of his body affecting both his arm and leg. He also had difficulty speaking and swallowing. The onset of symptoms was approximately 3 hours before ED arrival. He denied any headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  or confusion. No reported visual disturbances  vertigo  or incoordination.  Note: Such a case study takes into considerations the risk factors for stroke  such as age (most strokes occur in people aged 65 or older)  race (African American people are at higher risk)  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and family history of stroke.
Stroke,10,30,Case Scenario:  Patient Demographics: Name: Ms. Martha Hernandez Age: 67-years old Gender: Female Race: Hispanic/Latino Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Lives alone in an urban neighborhood Religion: Catholic Tobacco Use: None Alcohol Use: Occasional/social Important Family History: Mother suffered from a stroke at age 72  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for the past 20 years  managed with Lisinopril. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago  well controlled by Metformin. 3. Hyperlipidemia  managed with Statins. 4. Osteoporosis  confirmed on DEXA scan 5 years ago  on Calcium  and Vitamin D supplementation.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Hernandez arrived at the hospital  complaining of sudden onset weakness and numbness in the right side of her body which started roughly an hour ago. She also divulged feeling a weakness in her facial muscles  especially on the right side  and slurring her speech. She almost tripped while walking to the bathroom due to dizziness and reported blurred vision and a headache that has lasted for the past 2 days.  Conclusion:  Based on demographic representation  it is important to note that stroke is more prevalent among African Americans and Hispanics compared with Caucasians. Also  stroke risk increases two-fold for every decade after the age of 55. Comorbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia add to the risk of developing a stroke  making institutions prioritize addressing these conditions for better stroke prevention. This case will provide students with an understanding of acute stroke scenarios  highlighting the importance of quick identification and management. The scenario emphasizes time as a critical factor in managing stroke cases in the emergency department  reinforcing the concept “time is brain”.  References:  Go  A. S.  et al. (2013).

Stroke,10,31,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. George Taylor  a 70-year-old African American male  presents himself to the emergency room of our hospital.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Taylor has a documented past medical history of hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II)  which are under fairly controlled management. He also has a 30-year smoking history  albeit he quit five years back. He previously suffered from Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) a couple of years ago and is on regular medication of aspirin. His family history is significant for cardiovascular illnesses.   Chief Complaints:  Mr. Taylor visited the emergency room complaining of sudden onset of left-sided numbness along with difficulty in speech and confusion  persisting for the last 1 hour. His family mentioned he seemed fine until this sudden change in his condition.  According to the American Heart Association  stroke is responsible for one out of every 19 deaths in the United States and remains the leading cause of disability. It is more common in older individuals  especially African American males due to a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes  the two most significant risk factors for stroke. This simulation is designed giving considerations to these representative demographic features  thus encouraging medical students to consider these aspects in their clinical judgments and reasoning for similar presentations in real-life scenarios.
Stroke,10,32,Case Scenario:  Patient Details:  - Name: Mr. Rodriguez  - Age: 67 years old - Gender: Male - Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: Diagnosed at the age of 50 - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed at the age of 55 - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed at the age of 60 - Smoking: 20 pack-years (Stopped 2 years ago)  Key Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez was brought into the emergency department by his wife  complaining of a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. According to his wife  he had a severe headache around 1 hour ago  which resolved spontaneously. After the headache  he had trouble understanding her  found difficulty in walking due to the weakness of the right side of his body  and had slurred speech. He did not have any chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.   This case is designed to reflect the demographics of stroke patients as discussed in the literature. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States  with significant disparities in stroke mortality by race/ethnicity and geographic location. Age is a primary factor in stroke occurrence  with the risk doubling for each decade after age 55. Males have a higher risk of stroke than females. Certain ethnicities  including African Americans and Hispanics  have higher stroke mortality rates than Caucasians. Stroke is more common in individuals with a past medical history that includes hypertension  diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Hence  Mr. Rodriguez's case is characteristic of many stroke patients  presenting a typical but critical case for medical students to study.
Stroke,10,33,Case Report for Training: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Information: - Demographics: 71-year-old African American male - Occupation: Retired construction worker - Residency: Lives alone in an urban apartment  occasionally assisted by his adult daughter  Past Medical History: - Hypertension (treated with Lisinopril) - Type II Diabetes Mellitus (managed with Metformin) - Hyperlipidemia (managed with Atorvastatin) - Mild Cognitive Impairment - Smoker (past; quit 10 years ago) - Alcohol intake: moderate (restricted to social occasions) - No family history of stroke  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his daughter who found him confused and unable to talk clearly. Upon arrival at the hospital  the patient was noted to have: - Sudden onset of confusion and difficulty in speaking with slurred speech (noted by his daughter during a phone call) - Weakness in the right side of his body with difficulty gripping things which had started a few hours prior - Mild  persistent headache - History of forgetting to take medications sporadically over the past week  The above case report incorporates demographic groups who are at higher risk for stroke  i.e.  older age groups  African Americans  males  and people with comorbidities like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. It also includes common symptoms observed in an acute ischemic stroke  enabling medical students to understand how these symptoms might present in a real-world patient. The case  furthermore  supports students to recognize the importance of medication non-adherence in relation to an acute health event such as a stroke and stresses on the social  emotional  cognitive  and physical impacts on patient's life.
Stroke,10,34,Patient Information:  Name: Eduardo Santos Age: 65  Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Past Medical History: Mr. Santos has a history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  managed on medication (Lisinopril). Over the years  he has had poor compliance with diet and exercise  resulting in Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 5 years ago  with metformin therapy. He also has a 25-pack year history of smoking  although he quit smoking 15 years ago. There is no family history of stroke or other cardiovascular diseases.  Chief Complaints: As brought by his son  Mr. Santos has been experiencing intermittent severe headache for the past 1 week. Today  sudden onset of slurred speech and right-sided weakness occurred  which took him to the emergency department.  This scenario is reflective of a likely ischemic stroke for two dominant reasons: 1. Age: Stroke risk doubles each decade after the age of 55  and accordingly  our patient is in the prime age of susceptibility.  2. Ethnicity: Hispanics  in particular  have a higher risk of stroke compared to non-Hispanic whites.   This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing common stroke symptoms (sudden numbness or weakness  confusion  and severe headache)  as well as the significance of modifiable risk factors  including hypertension  diabetes  smoking  physical inactivity  and poor diet  in stroke prevention. Therefore  this case is valuable to students as a practical learning about preventive and emergency treatment interventions to improve patient outcomes in stroke management.
Stroke,10,35,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African-American male.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a 10-year history of poorly controlled hypertension and has been irregularly taking his antihypertensive medication. He also has a history of cigarette smoking (20 cigarettes a day for the past 30 years). There is no record of diabetes  heart diseases  or previous strokes. His father died of a stroke at age 72.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought into the emergency department by his son. The patient had come home from a walk and was having trouble walking  was slurring his speech  and his mouth was drooping on the right side. This was sudden in onset  happening about 1.5 hours back. He denies any headache  dizziness  or loss of consciousness. The patient also momentarily forgot his son's name  which is highly unusual for him. The patient further complains of numbness and weakness on the right side of his body.   Justification for Demographic Representation: A stroke case is chosen because it is one of the top leading causes of death and disability among adults in the U.S. The selection of a 68-year-old patient is based on the fact that the risk of stroke doubles every decade after 55. Using an African-American person is also medically relevant since they have a statistically higher risk of stroke than Caucasians. The choice of hypertension as an underlying disease is because it is the leading cause of stroke. The addition of smoking is due to its significant association with increased stroke risk. The history of non-compliance with medications showcases the common issue of patient non-adherence contributing to worsening health outcomes.
Stroke,10,36,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke   Patient Demographics:   Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old African American male  retired civil engineer  presents to the emergency department. He lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He has been a smoker for 30 years  but quit 5 years ago. His daily alcohol consumption is moderate. He is physically inactive  leading a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History:  According to Mr. Smith's medical records  he is hypertensive and diabetic. He has been on Losartan 50 mg once daily for hypertension and Metformin 500 mg twice daily for Type 2 diabetes  both for the last 10 years. He is not adherent to his medications and has poor glycemic control with a recent HbA1C of 8.2%. His last recorded BP was 155/95 mmHg. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation five years ago but he isn’t on any anticoagulant due to fear of side effects. He also has a history of dyslipidemia. He denies any previous history of stroke  TIA  CAD  PVD  renal disease or COPD. His father died due to complications of stroke.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith was brought by ambulance to the hospital within 90 minutes of onset of symptoms. He was found in the bathroom by his wife  unable to speak clearly and using the right side of his body with difficulty. Complaints include sudden-onset weakness on the right side of the body including the face  arm  and leg; speech difficulties; mild headache; but no loss of consciousness. He has no complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations or any others.  According to literature  stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Stroke risk increases with age  but strokes can and do occur at any age. Life style and certain diseases such as hypertension  atrial fibrillation  diabetes  etc.  poses an increased risk for stroke. Many studies show that African Americans have a much higher risk of death from a stroke than Caucasians. Males have a higher risk of stroke than females but more women than men die from stroke. This case represents a typical high-risk patient for a stroke. It takes into account an accurate demographic representation.   Next stages of this case will delve into a proper clinical examination  diagnostics  management  and long-term care planning for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke.
Stroke,10,37,Case Study: Stroke  Patient Information: Mr. James  a 68-year-old African American male  retired high school teacher  currently living with his wife. Both of them are non-smokers. They live in a suburban area and eat a balanced diet. He has some socioeconomic challenges as they live off pension and their savings.   Past Medical History: Mr. James has been managing hypertension for the past 15 years and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. Both conditions are controlled with medication. Five years ago  James was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has since been on statins. He's been adherent to his medications but intermittent in doing regular physical exercise.  Chief Complaint: In the early afternoon  Mr. James suddenly experienced numbness on the right side of his body  most explicitly on his face  arm  and leg. He felt a severe headache without a known cause and became disoriented. His wife noted his slurred speech and difficulty in understanding clear  simple directions. Because these symptoms occurred suddenly  his wife was able to recognize them as possible indicators of a stroke and called for emergency medical assistance.  This case study is designed to represent the statistical incidence of stroke  with a particular focus on an aging male patient with treated control of hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Particularly  African-American populations are at more significant risk for strokes  which is also in line with the choice of demographic representation. Socioeconomic factors are also critical in determining both risks of stroke and barriers to appropriate care.
Stroke,10,38,Patient Profile:  Name: Ms. Linda Williams Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Presenting Complaints:  1. Sudden numbness experienced on the right side of the body  particularly in the arm and leg. 2. Difficulty in speech and quick confusion. 3. Sudden severe headache with no known reason. 4. Trouble with vision in one eye.  Past Medical History:  1. A 20-years-long history of Hypertension treated with Lisinopril 10mg daily. 2. 5-years-long history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed with Metformin 500mg twice a day. 3. Smoker for the past 40 years with occasional alcohol intake. 4. Had an episode of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) 2 years ago.  Family History:  1. Mother passed away due to stroke at an old age. 2. Father had coronary artery disease.  Social History:  Lives alone; son and daughter live within a 1-hour drive. She is independent in her daily activities and only requires assistance with driving for distant travel.  Notes:  This case report is designed for medical students studying stroke. The patient  Ms. Williams  represents a realistic representation of population demographics portrayed in epidemiology data where African Americans  particularly those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking  carry a higher risk of strokes. The case should facilitate the understanding of the risk factors  recognizing signs and symptoms  appropriate diagnostic tests  management  and post-stroke patient care. The social and family history included intends to reflect the impact of community support and genetic predisposition  respectively.
Stroke,10,39,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Williams is a 65-year-old African-American male who is a retired automotive supervisor. He lives with his wife  is a long-time smoker with a 40-pack year history but quit recently  drinks socially (1-2 drinks/week)  and has a body mass index (BMI) of 28  which indicates overweight.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been managed with Lisinopril 20mg once daily  and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes Atorvastatin 40mg once nightly. Mr. Williams was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago which is currently managed by Metformin 1000mg twice daily. His last Hemoglobin A1C check was 7.2  three months ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Williams presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech that started two hours before arriving at the ED. His wife also noticed that the left side of his face seemed to be drooping. He denied experiencing any trauma  headache  dizziness  nausea or vomiting  visual abnormalities  or loss of balance. His respiration seemed normal  and he denied shortness of breath or chest pain. Although currently a non-smoker  he reported a prolonged history of heavy smoking alongside occasional alcohol consumption. He also confessed a lapse in managing his high blood pressure and diabetes as advised.  This case has been designed to reflect accurate demographic representation found in the literature as it pertains to stroke. Specifically  the patient case reflects that stroke risk is higher among African American individuals due to the increased prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in this group (1). Additionally  the demographic and lifestyle factors (such as age  gender  smoking history  and sedentary lifestyle) are consistent with known risk factors associated with stroke (2).   References: 1.

Stroke,10,40,Case Vignette:   Patient Profile: The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female referred to the hospital by her primary care physician. The patient  Mrs. Lewis  is a retired librarian who lives alone after her husband's death five years ago. Her son visits her often  but she is generally independent for her activities of daily living. Her socioeconomic status is moderate. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. Mrs. Lewis falls under the profile group most vulnerable to an ischemic stroke according to the literature.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Lewis has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is well controlled with metformin. She has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well  for which she takes losartan and atorvastatin. She also has a mild case of atrial fibrillation diagnosed five years ago  which she manages with oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban. She does not have a history of previous strokes  myocardial infarction or familial genetic disorders.   Recent complaints: Over recent weeks  her son noticed subtle changes in her memory and behavior  which were initially attributed to old age. However  two days ago  Mrs. Lewis developed speech difficulties where she struggled to get her words out  she also reported a sudden numbness on the right side of her body. These symptoms improved slightly but did not completely resolve.   The combination of her age  gender  ethnicity  history of atrial fibrillation  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension in addition to her initial presentations with speech difficulty and sudden numbness on one side gives high suspicion of an ischemic stroke. Appropriate imaging and work-up will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and manage Mrs. Lewis's condition effectively.   Learning Objectives for Medical Students: 1. Recognize the risk factors for stroke and how they influence its incidence. 2. Understand the early symptoms and signs of stroke to facilitate early diagnosis. 3. Appreciate the importance of seeking medical help quickly when stroke symptoms appear. 4. Implement the knowledge of primary and secondary prevention of stroke in at-risk patients. 5. Interpret clinical information to guide diagnostic evaluation and medical decision-making. 6. Involve patients and their families in health care decisions and provide counseling and education.  7. Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment plans and adjust as necessary.
Stroke,10,41,Patient Profile  Name: James Morrison (pseudonym) Age: 68 Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired Electrician Home: Lives alone in a single-story house  Past Medical History: James has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. He quit smoking 5 years ago after an astonishing 35 years of tobacco use  but he remains overweight with a BMI of 31. He takes metformin (500 mg twice daily)  and lisinopril (10 mg daily). There is a family history of cardiovascular disease: his father died of a heart attack at 60 and his elder brother had a stroke at the age of 70.  Presenting Complaints: James went to bed feeling normal  but woke up around 4 AM to use the bathroom and noticed that he couldn’t control his left leg and was unable to get up from bed. He also found the left side of his face was drooping. He tried to call out for help  but his speech was slurred. No headache  vertigo  or other symptoms reported.  Chronic Diseases: 1. Hypertension 2. Type 2 Diabetes 3. Obesity   Conditions: High risk of stroke due to hypertension  type 2 diabetes  family history  past smoking  and obesity.  Patient medication: 1. Metformin (500 mg twice daily) 2. Lisinopril (10 mg daily)  This case takes into account the higher prevalence of stroke in African Americans  the impact of existing co-morbidity in patients (hypertension  obesity  diabetes)  and the common risk factors that can lead to stroke (Age  family history  past smoking). Above all  the case aims to teach students to recognize the classic symptoms like hemiplegia & facial droop  and the urgency of the situation given the time-limitations for acute stroke treatment.
Stroke,10,42,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Jose Rodriguez  an 64-year-old Hispanic male  from a low-income suburb. He is a former manual worker with a history of exposure to occupational hazards. Mr. Rodriguez is a non-smoker and non-drinker.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years  hypertension for 14 years  both of which are being treated with medication. However  due to financial challenges  he admits occasionally skipping medications and regular check-ups. He also has a history of dyslipidemia. There is no known history of any other significant health conditions.  Escalating Complaints: Over the past week  Mr. Rodriguez's daughter noticed that he has been complaining of recurrent moderate headaches despite taking over-the-counter painkillers. One day prior to presentation  he complained of a sudden loss of balance followed by transient blurring of vision which lasted for a few minutes. She also noted him having slight difficulty speaking which seemed to improve after a short while.   Overnight  he developed a sudden onset of weakness in his right side  with his right arm and right leg becoming difficult to move. His daughter also noticed that the right side of his face seemed to droop. He was immediately taken to the emergency department.   Significant Clinical Findings: On examination  Mr. Rodriguez showed signs of Facial drooping  Arm weakness and Speech difficulties (F.A.S.T)  indicative of a stroke.   Learning Objectives: This case can be used to study about stroke etiology  pathophysiology  identification of clinical symptoms and signs  F.A.S.T stroke approach  management  and prevention strategies. It can also highlight the impact of socio-economic  racial  and occupational disparities on health outcomes.  Cultural Considerations:  Understand the diverse cultural perspective on health and illness  and the cultural stigma attached to disease and medication. Study communication techniques used in Spanish-speaking patients. Address the social determinants of health that reduce access to healthcare in minority and low-income populations. 
Stroke,10,43,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. James Patterson Age: 67 years Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired engineer Location: Urban  Background:  Mr. Patterson  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department. He is reportedly a retired engineer  non-smoker  and enjoys moderate alcohol.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Patterson had hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with amlodipine and low-dose aspirin  and has regular follow-ups. He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes for the past 5 years  controlled through metformin and lifestyle modifications. He had an appendectomy at the age of 30. There is a documented family history of stroke from his mother's side.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Patterson was brought in by his daughter after she noticed him experiencing sudden onset of speech difficulties and right-sided weakness when she called him over the phone for their daily chat. The symptoms commenced abruptly about an hour prior to arrival at the hospital. It is important to note that Mr. Patterson lives alone and is generally of good health  capable of independent activities of daily living prior to this incident.  Considering the acute onset of hemiparesis and speech impairment  a differential diagnosis of stroke should be highly considered. The patient's age  ethnicity  male sex  and existing comorbidities (history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus) are significant risk factors for stroke. Further investigations  management  and discussion should focus on acute stroke care  prevention of secondary complications  and rehabilitation.   This case acts as an essential teaching tool to understand the urgency of stroke recognition  manage time-sensitive thrombolysis intervention decisions  and address the importance of multidisciplinary post-stroke care. Regular follow-ups would be necessary to manage chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes that have a significant role in secondary prevention of stroke. Furthermore  it will provide students an insight into the complex interplay of genetic  lifestyle  and environmental factors that contribute to stroke risk.
Stroke,10,44,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Ms. Lucy  African American female  68-years-old  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History: The patient is a known hypertensive for the last 10 years. Additionally  she is a type 2 diabetic  maintained on metformin for the past 8 years. She is non-compliant with her medications. Also  she has a 20-year history of smoking  consuming nearly half a pack of cigarettes daily. No known drug allergies or intolerances. She has no history of prior surgeries or hospitalizations.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Lucy was brought in by her daughter. The daughter reports that her mother's speech became slurred and she noticed an unexplained weakness in her mother's right arm and leg while having breakfast together. The patient also complained of sudden-onset  moderate  throbbing headache. This sudden change in behavior occurred roughly 1 hour prior to presentation at the ER.  Background: The prevalence of stroke is higher in African American populations than in non-Hispanic white populations. A major reason for this disparity is the higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in African American populations. Smoking  a common modifiable risk factor  contributes significantly to this increased risk. Other notable demographic characteristics for stroke include advancing age (the risk doubles for each decade after 55) and female gender. Patient's complaints and symptoms strongly suggest acute stroke. This case thus aims to acquaint students with the clinical presentation of acute stroke.  Note: This case reflects actual disparities in stroke prevalence but does not mean to suggest that all or even most African American elderly females are at risk for stroke. It is also important to note that individual patient experiences can differ significantly.
Stroke,10,45,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Ethnicity: African American  Gender: Female Age: 68 years  Employment: Retired schoolteacher  Residence: Urban setting   Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension  2. Type 2 Diabetes  3. Hypercholesterolemia  4. History of Smoking (stopped 10 years ago)  5. Moderate Alcohol Consumption  6. Mild Obesity   Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. B  a 68-year-old African American female  presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of weakness in the right side of her body that started around two hours ago. She complained of slurred speech and difficulties in understanding what others were saying. She memorably mentioned feeling an unusual sensation in her right arm and leg  likening it to """"them not being present at all"""". Mrs. B's daughter clarified that her mother's face appeared asymmetrical suddenly  with the right side of her mouth appearing droopy compared to the left. Mrs. B has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia  which she's been on medications for the past 15 years.   Note: This patient falls into a high-risk category for stroke given her age  race  and medical history. Her symptoms including sudden-onset physical weakness  speech difficulties  and facial drooping are also typical presentations of a stroke. These serve as key teaching points for medical trainees to identify and quickly respond to potential cases of stroke. It is also necessary to note here that the significant risk factor in the scenario  the ethnicity (African American)  is reflective of the disproportionate burden of stroke morbidity and mortality observed in this demographic group. The intention here is to sensitize future clinicians towards recognizing these disparities and ensure equitable care delivery."
Stroke,10,46,Case Title: Acute Ischemic Stroke – Hypertension Management   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male. Despite being retired  he has maintained a fairly active lifestyle and lives independently.   Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 20 years  which has been controlled with medication. He also has Type 2 diabetes for 15 years and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide  metformin  and atorvastatin. Besides these conditions  he has no significant psychiatric history or surgeries. He has no history of smoking  but reports occasional alcohol use. His father was diagnosed with stroke at an early age.  Key Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department by his son who found him with symptoms of slurred speech and right-sided weakness when he went to visit him in the afternoon. The patient claims he woke up from his nap with these issues around 45 minutes ago. He denies any headache  vision problems  or loss of consciousness. He reports no chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  Discussion: This case illustrates a typical stroke case with associated risk factors  including age  race  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. According to literature  African American patients have a higher risk of stroke than Caucasian patients. Stroke rates are also higher among people aged 65 years or older. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for stroke  followed by diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The typical stroke symptoms demonstrated by the patient  such as slurred speech and unilateral weakness  are classic warning signs of a stroke.   Objective: The main aim of this case is to educate and train medical students to identify the signs and symptoms of stroke promptly and also understand the importance of managing underlying health conditions as a prevention strategy. The case further promotes the need for physicians to address stroke risks according to individual patient profiles culturally sensitively and inclusively. 
Stroke,10,47,Case Report:  Demographics:   Patient is a 72-year-old African-American male retiree currently residing in a suburban setting.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented medical history of hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with medication (Lisinopril)  and a history of smoking (1 pack/day for approximately 30 years  quit 15 years ago). He also has mild hyperlipidemia  treated with diet. He leads a sedentary lifestyle  with limited physical activity. Family history reveals his father died from a stroke at age 68  whilst his mother passed due to complications of diabetes.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented at the emergency department displaying significant right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started abruptly while watching television at home. His wife  who brought him to the hospital  reported that he seemed confused and his speech was slurred. He also mentioned a sudden headache  but denied any chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.   Note:   This case study is designed to emphasize the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms early. The patient's demographics reflect the fact that African Americans and older adults have been found to have a higher risk of stroke  and these two factors are significant demographic risk factors as per the literature. Other risk factors included in this case study are hypertension  history of smoking  excessive alcohol consumption  and family history. This case shows how a stroke can present  highlighting the importance of time when dealing with potential stroke patients.
Stroke,10,48,Case Study: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Information: Name: James Roberts (Pseudonym) Age: 66 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer  Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes losartan  atorvastatin  and Metformin respectively. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years. There is no past history of stroke or myocardial infarction  but his father suffered a stroke at the age of 70. Previous routine check-ups indicate moderate control of diabetes and hypertension.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Roberts presented to the emergency department with sudden onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech that started around 45 minutes prior to arrival. He denied having a headache  alteration in consciousness  or seizure. He also complained of dizziness and confusion.  Emergency Department Assessment: On presentation  his vitals were: Blood Pressure: 170/105 mmHg  Pulse: 97 bpm  Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)  Respiration Rate: 18 breaths/minute  and Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air. Mr. Roberts appeared alert but visibly distressed.  Initial neurological evaluation hinted a right hemispheric stroke symptomatology: facial droop  left arm drift  and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 8.  This case is designed to provide medical students an opportunity to understand the evaluation  management  and potential complications of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Each student's approach  reasoning  diagnostic steps  and management plan can then be discussed and critiqued  offering a rich learning environment. 
Stroke,10,49,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 67-year-old African-American female  retired school teacher  living in a suburban setting with her husband.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been controlled with medication. She has no known drug allergies. Her other relevant history includes hyperlipidemia (controlled with atorvastatin) and a 30-pack-year smoking history  although the patient quit 15 years ago. She has no prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks and no known family history of stroke.   Key Complaints and Presentation:  The patient was brought to the emergency department by her husband after he noticed sudden onset of slurred speech  drooping of the right corner of her mouth  and weakness on her right side  which started approximately two hours prior  Key Stroke Risk Factors: African-American ethnicity  age above 60  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and hyperlipidemia.   Clinical Scenario:  This case brings forward a classical presentation of a stroke. The patient's multiple risk factors including hypertensive and hyperglycemic history  along with her demographic details map well to the risk factors associated with stroke  as found in literature. The sudden onset of hemiparesis  facial droop  and slurred speech are signs of a probable left-brain stroke. Therefore  this case is ideal for teaching students the immediate steps necessary in hospital settings for stroke evaluation and treatment (e.g.  ABCs  “Time is Brain ” rapid neurological exam  prompt CT imaging  etc.).   It underpins critical teaching points including appropriate differential diagnoses  the significance of timely treatment decisions  the importance of controlling modifiable risk factors for stroke  and the possible post-stroke patient management required.
Stroke,10,50,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. J is a 68-year-old African American male who works as a retired school principal  living in urban Atlanta  Georgia. He is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption. His family history includes hypertension and diabetes - his elder brother died of a stroke at the age of 69.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history indicates that he has been receiving treatment for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the last 10 years. His medications include Losartan 50 mg once daily and Metformin 500 mg twice daily. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels have been relatively well controlled with above medications. He is also overweight (BMI of 30) and does maintaining a sedentary lifestyle primarily due to arthritis.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. J presented to the emergency department accompanied by his wife. She reported that he suddenly seemed confused and had trouble speaking. He also had difficulty walking  with a noticeable droop on the right side of his face. His symptoms occurred while he was watching television  and they have persisted for about 1.5 hours prior to his arrival at the hospital.  This training case aims to represent the typical risk factors and demographic profile of a stroke patient  based on epidemiological data. In the U.S  stroke is more common and more deadly among African Americans than among whites  possibly due to higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Stroke risk also increases with age  particularly after age 65. This case also takes into account lifestyle factors that can contribute to stroke  such as sedentary behavior and being overweight.   The clinical presentation in this case - sudden onset of speech difficulties  facial drooping  and difficulty walking - are classic symptoms of stroke. This case would assist medical students to understand the clinical presentation  potential risk factors  and the urgent need to manage these patients to prevent long term morbidity.
Stroke,10,51,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Demographics: Mr. Jose Mendoza  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  lives in a suburban community with his wife. He is a retired schoolteacher and is relatively active around his neighborhood. He smokes occasionally (around 5 cigarettes per week) and drinks alcohol sparingly (approximately one glass of red wine per day). His body mass index (BMI) is 29.  Past Medical History: Mr. Mendoza has a significant medical history  including hypertension  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. All conditions are being managed with medication and regular consultations with his doctor. There is a family history of cerebrovascular diseases; both his father and grandfather suffered from strokes.  Key Complaints: Mr. Mendoza presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness  slurred speech  and difficulty swallowing  all of which began approximately 2 hours prior. He showed signs of facial droop on the right side as well. His wife reported that he had been struggled with unsteadiness and difficulty in walking. She expressed concerns about her husband's memory and cognitive abilities since he appeared confused  often repeating the same question multiple times.  Accurate demographic consideration: The demographics of the patient including age  race  and underlying health conditions are consistent with research indicating increased stroke risk among old age  ethnic minorities  and individuals with uncontrolled chronic diseases (hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia).
Stroke,10,52,Case Report: The Stroke Patient  Patient Demographics: Mr. Anthony Brown  an African-American  68 years old  retired university lecturer  is a native of Detroit  Michigan. Mr. Brown is a widower who lives alone but has a son who lives nearby. He’s a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. He often admits having a diet rich in fast food due to unavailability of homemade meals.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a significant past medical history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both conditions having been diagnosed 10 years ago. He is compliant with his prescribed medications: Metformin 1000mg bid for Diabetes and Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension. He's been on low-dose aspirin (75mg) for cardiovascular risk reduction for five years.   Key Complaints: Today  Mr. Brown was brought to the emergency department by his son who found him in a confused state when he visited him in the morning. His son noticed that his dad's speech was slurred  and he was having trouble moving his right-side limbs. Mr. Brown himself noticed an extreme headache  blurred vision  and dizziness. He also reported that the symptoms started last night when he woke up to go to the bathroom but chose to ignore them hoping they were caused by fatigue.  This training case focuses on early detection of stroke symptoms  particularly in high-risk individuals like Mr. Brown- elderly  African-American  and with comorbidities of hypertension and diabetes. The aim is to guide the students to formulate a proper plan of investigation  diagnosis  and intervention while considering the risk factors  clinical manifestations  patient’s health behavior  and socioeconomic context.

He is a retired high school mathematics teacher and lives with his wife of 45 years. Mr. Johnson has a history of obesity  hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and has been a casual smoker with a 20-pack year history.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson reports sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech that has been progressing over the course of the morning. These symptoms compelled his wife to bring him to the hospital.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has had a history of hypertension for the past 15 years which is relatively well-controlled by Lisinopril 20 mg daily. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus a decade ago  managed with Metformin 500 mg twice daily  and follow-up assessments have been acceptable with a recent HbA1c of 7.1%. His body mass index is 32 kg/m²  categorizing him as obese. Mr. Johnson has been advised multiple times to quit smoking though has found it difficult to abstain completely.  Social history indicates Mr. Johnson has quit drinking alcohol 25 years ago and vehemently denies any illicit drug use. He is in a monogamous relationship  and there is no family history of any heritable diseases; however  his father suffered a stroke in his late 70s.  Vital signs on arrival include blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 86 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 98% on room air  and a temperature of 36.7 °C.  This case focuses on aspects of stroke  emphasizing the common risk factors encountered in clinical practice such as old age  African American ethnicity  male gender  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  obesity  smoking  and family history. Medical students are expected to direct their attention to these complex  interlinked contributors while conducting a holistic patient evaluation. This case also underscores the importance of recognizing early signs of stroke  such as sudden unilateral weakness and speech difficulties.  Please note: This case does not represent a real patient and is designed purely for medical education purposes. All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons  living or dead  is purely coincidental.
Stroke,10,54,Case Study: Stroke   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male named Mr. Smith who is retired. He lives with his wife of 42 years in their home. Mr. Smith is a former smoker  quitting 15 years ago  but still maintains an occasional drink. He leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith's medical history is significant for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  both of which he has been managing for the past 10 years with medication. Despite this  his blood pressure has been uncontrolled on several of his last clinic visits. Additionally  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol a year ago but he has been noncompliant with the statin therapy prescribed. He has a family history of stroke with his father having suffered from a stroke at the age of 70.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith's wife noticed that he suddenly started slurring his words during a conversation. She also noticed that his right arm appeared weak and he was unable to hold his coffee cup properly. Within minutes  he lost complete control and movement in his right arm and the right side of his facial muscles  showing an uneven smile. Mr. Smith also reported a sudden severe headache unlike any other he has experienced before  with accompanying dizziness and a brief episode of visual disturbance.  This is a classic presentation of a stroke in progress  therefore immediate medical attention is warranted. Prompt recognition of these symptoms is critical in the diagnosis and management of stroke  and timely commencement of thrombolysis can dramatically improve the outcome for this patient.   Rationale:   This case is representative of a typical stroke patient. The American Stroke Association states that factors such as age  race  sex  and heredity can determine stroke risk. Stroke risk increases with age  and men are at a higher risk until older ages  where the risk becomes equal. African-Americans are at higher risk due to higher prevalences of risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and obesity. Hypertension  smoking  diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia are modifiable risk factors for stroke  making them important considerations for prevention. 
Stroke,10,55,Case Report:  Patient Name: Mr. Jones (anonymized for privacy) Age: 67 years Race: African American Gender: Male Occupation: Retired postman Residential Area: Urban  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for the last 10 years  on medication 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago  managed by diet and oral medication 3. Smoker for the past 30years (20 cigarettes/day). 4. Family history of cardiovascular diseases  lost his father to heart attack at the age of 60.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Jones presented to the ER department complaining of sudden onset of: 1. Weakness and numbness on the right side of the body – he was unable to grip items with his right hand  and his right leg gave way when he tried to walk. 2. Slurred speech – he was finding it hard to talk clearly and his daughter noticed that his words were mumbled and unclear. 3. Changes to his vision – stated that he 'couldn’t see properly' in his right eye. 4. A severe headache – describing it as 'the worst headache' he ever had  localized in the frontal region and did not ease off with his usual painkillers.  These symptoms have started about 2 hours ago while he was having his breakfast. There are no other associated symptoms and he felt perfectly well when he woke up in the morning.  Mr. Jones' daughter  who was with him during breakfast  noticed that his face appeared asymmetrical  with drooping on the right side and that he was struggling to raise both arms. Based on these classic stroke symptoms she immediately called the emergency helpline.   This case is a typical representation of a stroke patient. Literature suggests higher stroke rates in African American men  particularly those aged 55-75 years. Smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and diabetes mellitus type 2 also increase the risks of stroke  aligning with this patient's history. The symptoms described are characteristic of a stroke with motor and speech impairment  and the early identification and treatment intervention will be key in determining the patient's prognosis.
Stroke,10,56,Case Study: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Information: Name: Mr. James Smith Gender: Male Age: 72 years old Ethnicity: African American Residence: Urban environment Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type II diabetes. He has been on antihypertensive medications and metformin for 10 years. He is a former smoker with a smoking history of 30 years with cessation 5 years ago. He does not consume alcohol. There's no history of any surgical interventions. Family history includes a father who died from a stroke at the age of 68 years.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith presented to the Emergency department with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness  difficulty speaking  and difficulty swallowing which began about an hour ago. His daughter who stays with him noticed that he had a facial droop and his speech was slurred  which led her to seek immediate medical attention. He complained of no pain  but was extremely anxious and distressed due to the sudden loss of normal function.  Physical Exam: On general examination  Mr. Smith was conscious but anxious. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg  and a regular pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. Neurological examination revealed right-sided facial droop  deviation of the angle of the mouth to the left  and slurred speech. He was unable to raise his right arm or leg against gravity. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.   This is an acute case that warrants immediate medical intervention. The crucial aspect of this case management for medical students should be the understanding of 'time is brain' concept in stroke management  considering the presenting complaints and the past medical history.  Note: This is a case setup for an Ischemic stroke. The case helps to illustrate the typical risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  age  African American descent  former smoker)  and symptoms (right-sided weakness  facial droop  difficulty speaking and swallowing) related to Ischemic stroke. However  stroke can occur at any age and in any race/ethnic group and this case does not intend to stereotype or stigmatize any group. Medical students should understand that every case is unique and should be handled based on the individual's medical history and symptoms  not their demographics. This case is merely an example of a common scenario seen in medical practice.
Stroke,10,57,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 72-year old African-American woman  based on the fact that the incidence rate of strokes is higher in this population. She resides in a rural area  which is important to note due to the difficulty in getting prompt medical care in these regions. Though retired  she does some part-time administrative work from home.  Past Medical History: The patient is a former smoker with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. She has struggled with diabetes for over 10 years  but has managed it with medication and diet control. She also has a familial history of cardiovascular disease  as her mother had suffered a stroke at the age of 65. She has no known allergies to medications.   Key Complaints: The patient reports a sudden onset of severe headache  one she describes as the “worst she’s ever felt”  accompanied by dizziness. There are weaknesses on the right side of her body  difficulty speaking  sudden blurred vision in one eye  and trouble walking due to lack of balance and coordination.  Medical students  using this concise and rich case  will have the chance to diagnose  discuss and understand stroke  its risk factors  symptoms  and the importance of immediate medical intervention in saving lives and reducing subsequent complications.   The demographics and the patient's past medical history are crucial in heightening the students' awareness of the susceptibility of the aging African-American population—especially those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and family history of stroke—to cerebral vascular accidents. This case study will also draw students' attention to the challenges in accessing prompt medical care for stroke patients in rural areas.
Stroke,10,58,Case Report:  Patient's Profile:  Name: Mrs. Sanchez Age: 68 Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Location: South California  Past Medical History: Mrs. Sanchez has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and her treatment includes oral anti-hypertensive and statin medication respectively. She was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago  which she controls with lifestyle modifications and metformin. She also had atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years ago and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.   Key Complaints: Mrs. Sanchez was brought in by her daughter after she noticed some sudden unusual symptoms. She was watching TV when her daughter said she started slurring her words  her right arm became weak  and she had trouble standing up on her own. Her daughter also mentioned that she seemed confused and appeared to not comprehend what she was saying. These symptoms have persisted for about 45 minutes.  This case focuses on stroke  hence each element of the case including the patient's profile and past medical history has been carefully chosen as per risk factors associated with stroke as mentioned in the literature. The demographics of the patient represent the higher prevalence of stroke amongst older adults  Hispanics  and those with comorbid conditions like hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation. The key complaints are typical of an acute ischemic stroke  characterized by sudden onset confusion  slurred speech and right-sided weakness.   This case provides learners with an opportunity to evaluate a patient with potential stroke  understand the importance of timely recognition and management  including thrombolytic therapy  and the potential need for post-stroke rehabilitation.
Stroke,10,59,Case Report: Stroke  Patient Demographics:  - Age: 65-year-old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired Schoolteacher - Residence: Urban setting - Marital Status: Married with three grown children  Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Type II Diabetes Mellitus - High cholesterol - 40 pack/year smoking history - Occasional alcohol intake  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought into the emergency department by his wife. He was found in the kitchen  struggling to speak and couldn't move the right side of his body. The onset of symptoms was sudden  and they noticed them about 1 hour ago. Symptoms noticed included:  - Right-sided weakness and limpness - Facial drooping on the right side - Slurred speech  - Confusion and difficulty understanding simple instructions - Sudden severe headache with no known cause.   Clinical features of this case have been chosen considering the common demographic (African American male  aged around 65 years) as well as risk factors (Hypertension  smoking  diabetes  and high cholesterol) for stroke. This case allows medical students to understand the typical presentation of stroke  important risk factors  the urgency of treatment  and potential complications. It also emphasizes the importance of quick recognition and treatment of stroke for best patient outcomes.
Stroke,10,60,Case Report:  Patient Information:   The patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Thomas. He is a retired schoolteacher  living with his wife in the suburban vicinity. He has two grown-up children who live separately.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thomas was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels are under control with medication. He was a heavy smoker (20 cigarettes a day) for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. His father died of a stroke at 67  and his mother had coronary artery disease.  Present Complaints:   Mr. Thomas's wife brought him to the hospital when she noticed he was having difficulty speaking clearly and was drooling while eating breakfast. His wife also reports that he seemed confused and couldn't lift his right arm like usual. He seemed to not recognize the symptoms as alarming and was dismissing his issues as tiredness or old age.   Demographic Representation:  The case is aimed at representing a substantial risk group demographic for stroke. According to literature  African American males are at a higher risk of stroke  specifically Ischemic stroke. The fact that Mr. Thomas has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are recognized as significant risk factors for stroke  increases his vulnerability. His past history of heavy smoking also contributes to this risk. His age  being over 60  puts him in a higher risk category as well  with stroke risk doubling every decade after the age of 55.    Learning Objectives:  In this case  the aim is for students to identify the warning signs of a stroke  risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and older age. Students should also be able to communicate effectively with the patient and family  understand the importance of urgent management  and immediate referral for imaging to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate treatment.
Stroke,10,61,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Jenkins  a 74-year-old African American male from a low socio-economic background  presents to the emergency department of the hospital.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jenkins has been diagnosed with hypertension  diabetes mellitus type II  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker  quit  10 years ago after smoking for almost three decades. He occasionally drinks alcohol. Family history is significant  with his father having suffered a stroke at around the same age. He is currently on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril)  metformin for diabetes  and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Jenkins was found by his grand-daughter at home  slouched over his favorite chair. He seemed confused  had difficulty speaking  and his right side facial droop was quickly noted. In addition  he demonstrated a weakness in his right arm and leg with loss of balance and coordination – an alarming change from his usual capabilities.  Given the above case report  medical students would then be asked to consider the patient's demographics and medical history in order to hypothesize the most likely diagnoses  propose further necessary diagnostic tests  and outline an appropriate treatment plan. Particularly  they should respond to his current symptoms and the risk factors associated with his age  race  socioeconomic status  and family history  pointing towards a probable stroke. Furthermore  this case also serves to highlight the importance of controlling chronic diseases such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia which are known risk factors for stroke. 
Stroke,10,62,Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. George Edwards Age: 67 years Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired Social History: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol intake Insurance: Medicare   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension  for the past 10 years. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 7 years ago. 3. Hyperlipidemia.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Edwards was brought into the emergency department by his daughter who is the primary caregiver. She provides a history of sudden onset of Mr. Edwards' speech slurring which was noticed while having dinner. This was accompanied by left-sided weakness  difficulty walking  and numbness in his left arm and leg. The symptoms started about 1.5 hours back. No history of recent trauma  headaches  seizures  loss of consciousness  or visual changes. No previous history of similar events. Mr. Edwards is currently alert but appears anxious. He has not had any surgeries in the past and is compliant with all his medications.  Note: Stroke is the fifth cause of death and leading cause of disability in the US. The risk of stroke is about 2 times higher in African Americans than in Caucasians. Further  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia significantly contribute to increased stroke risk. Men are more likely to have stroke than women  but more women die from stroke. Age is also a significant risk factor; the chance of having a stroke approximately doubles for each decade of life after age 55.   This case  therefore  provides a realistic scenario where a patient displays key symptoms and has important risk factors  providing students an opportunity to refine their diagnostic and patient management skills.
Stroke,10,63,"Case Report: Cerebrovascular Accident  Patient Demographics:   - Name: MM (patient details anonymized) - Sex: Male - Age: 68 - Race/Ethnicity: African-American - Occupation: Retired teacher  - Geographic location: Urban Midwest  Past Medical History:   - Hypertension diagnosed 13 years ago - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  - Mild Hyperlipidemia  - 40 pack-year history of smoking (quit 5 years ago) - Family history of stroke in first-degree relatives (both father and sister)  Key Complaints:   MM arrives at the emergency department escorted by his son. His son explains that MM seemed fine in the morning  but within the last hour  he suddenly appeared confused  had difficulty speaking and understanding speech. His right face  arm  and leg also seemed weak.  On examination  MM exhibits signs of facial drooping on the right side  slurred speech  and slight right-side neglect. He struggles to raise his right arm and leg fully when asked. His consciousness is unaffected; however  he appears to have obvious difficulty understanding some of the basic commands given by the medical staff.   This case of MM is designed to be representative of the demographic most affected by stroke - older  African-American males with a history of hypertension and smoking. The complaint of sudden onset difficulty in speech and understanding  coupled with right-sided weakness and facial drooping  is classic for left hemisphere stroke syndrome.  Through MM's case  students can be trained to recognize the classic presentations of stroke  understand the importance of risk factor mitigation  and approach to initial management. They should also be guided to understand the unique challenges posed by strokes - including language barriers  disabilities  and the need for prompt care.   Key Learning Points:   1. Importance of recognising classic signs of a stroke. 2. Association of stroke risk with hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  smoking history  and family history. 3. Importance of immediate attention and acute management of stroke. 4. The impact of stroke on patient’s daily living activities and role of rehabilitation services.   References:  1.

Stroke,10,64,"Case Study - Stroke  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 67 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanic  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  managed with Lisinopril. 2. Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Metformin. 3. No known history of heart disease. 4. Previous history of smoking (20 pack-years)  quit 5 years ago. 5. Regular alcohol consumption of 5-7 units per week. 6. No known drug allergies or adverse drug reactions.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe presents to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of sudden onset of drooping on the left side of his face  weakness in his left arm and leg  and difficulty speaking. These symptoms first appeared approximately two hours prior to his arrival at the ED. His wife  who is his caretaker  also noticed that he had trouble understanding her questions and responds inappropriately. No complaints of headache  loss of consciousness  or seizures.  Summary: This case represents a common scenario of an elderly male patient  with relevant past medical history presenting with typical signs of ischemic stroke. With the demographic set as a Caucasian male  it complements the fact that stroke is more common in men and older individuals. It also considers high-risk comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore  his past smoking history and moderate alcohol consumption add to his risk for stroke. His symptoms align with the typical clinical presentation of acute cerebrovascular accident/stroke. This case would be suitable for teaching medical students about prompt recognition and management of stroke. It emphasizes the importance of """"Time is Brain"""" concept in acute stroke care."
Stroke,10,65,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. James Palmer Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired elementary school principal Location: Urban area  Detroit  Michigan Insurance Status: Medicare  Past Medical History: - Hypertension  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus  - Hyperlipidemia. - Smoking (quit 10 years ago  smoked for 30 years)  Presentation: Mr. Palmer was brought to the ER by his neighbor  who found him partially unresponsive in his apartment. The patient is experiencing severe headache and has slurred speech. He had trouble understanding the neighbor’s questions. The neighbor reports that Mr. Palmer's symptoms appeared suddenly when they were talking approximately 90 minutes ago.  Key Complaints: - Severe headache - Confusion - Difficulty in speech - Weakness on the right side of the body - Difficulty walking   Risk Factors Highlighted: - Age - Race - Hypertension - Diabetes - Hyperlipidemia - History of smoking  The purpose of this case study is to emphasize the importance of early recognition of stroke symptoms and prompt emergency management. It would also highlight the role of primary prevention in managing modifiable stroke risk factors. The case further illustrates the higher incidence of stroke in the African American population  as well as the increased risk among those with hypertension  diabetes  and a history of smoking.

Stroke,10,66,Case Report:   Patient Information and Demographics: Mr. James Carver is a 65-year-old African American male living in Washington D.C.  United States. He is retired and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker and quit about a decade ago. He has had no history of illicit drug or alcohol abuse. His BMI falls in the overweight range (29).   Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for the past 15 years  managed with Lisinopril. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled with Metformin. 3. High cholesterol level  diagnosed 5 years ago  managed with Atorvastatin. 4. No history of heart disease or cancers. 5. He has an allergy to Penicillin. 6. Annual flu vaccines up-to-date.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Carver visited the Emergency Department reporting a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and partial loss of vision in his right eye that began a couple of hours earlier. He also noticed difficulty in speaking and swallowing  combined with a severe  throbbing headache. His wife reported that he seemed disoriented and confused. No history of recent trauma  fever  or seizures.  Analysis:  Given the background of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  along with the acute onset neurological deficits  the patient is at high risk for stroke. Age and Afro-American ethnicity are also risk factors according to literature. Immediate medical attention is required to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate management.  This case is created to represent the average patient with a stroke to demonstrate the demographic distribution and typical presentation. The most common factors  such as age above 60  Afro-American ethnicity  history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  are included. This case serves as a valuable learning tool for medical students when studying stroke given its realistic and representative nature.
Stroke,10,67,Case Report:  Patient Information: Name: Mr. William Thompson Age: 69  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired firefighter  Background: Mr. Thompson lives with his wife in a suburban area. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. He has a fondness for food high in fat and low in fiber. He is moderately physically active. He likes to garden and takes walks around the neighborhood.  Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing for the past 10 years. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)  atenolol  and rosuvastatin. About eight months ago  he was diagnosed with prediabetes. Despite lifestyle adjustment measures  his blood glucose levels remain slightly elevated. His father had a history of ischemic stroke at the age of 72 and that has concerned Mr. Thompson.   Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson presented at the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty in speaking  and facial droop noticed by his wife. The symptoms began a few hours prior to presentation. He denies experiencing headache  chest pain  or any other discomfort. His wife also noticed Mr. Thompson seemed more confused than usual.  Current Status: At Present  Mr. Thompson is conscious  alert  and oriented but appears in distress due to difficulty in speaking and left side weakness. His blood pressure is slightly elevated at 165/90 mmHg.   This case study engages with male patient in late 60s presenting with emergent stroke symptoms. This case is particularly illustrative of the risk factors for stroke – hypertensive  hyperlipidemic  and prediabetic status  history of smoking  and familial disposition to stroke.   References: 1.

Stroke,10,68,Patient Case:  Name: Mr. James Harrison Age: 65 years Race: African American Sex: Male Occupation: Retired School Teacher Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: James has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 7 years. He also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus and is obese with a BMI of 30. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years  smoking approximately a pack of cigarettes a day. James also has mild hypercholesterolemia for which he is on statin therapy. His mother suffered a stroke at the age of 70.  Presenting Complaints: James was brought into the ER by his daughter who found him in his bedroom  confused  and unable to speak clearly. She also reported that he was complaining of severe headache and felt dizzy before the symptoms started. On further questioning  she revealed that he was unable to grip his coffee mug with his right hand this morning.  This case is designed to highlight the risk factors  presentation  and complications of stroke. It targets the African American population  which has nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared to Caucasians. African Americans also have the highest rate of death due to stroke.  Key learning objectives from this case should include the identification of risk factors for stroke (such as hypertension  smoking  diabetes  obesity  and familial history)  recognizing the signs of stroke (confusion  speech problems  weakness in one side of the body)  understanding the need for urgent intervention  and primary and secondary prevention strategies.
Stroke,10,69,Patient Case Study: Cerebrovascular Accident   Patient's Information: Name: James Johnson Age: 67 Sex: Male Race: African American  Past Medical History: James has a documented past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic atrial fibrillation. He had been a smoker for 30 years  but quit 10 years ago. He has inconsistent medication adherence  particularly with his antihypertensive medication and anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation.  Presenting Complaint:  James presented into the emergency department  accompanied by his wife whom he had called. She noticed an abrupt onset of slurred speech  right-sided facial drooping  and weakness of the right arm when he failed to pick up a cup. At the time  they reported these symptoms starting approximately an hour prior to their arrival.  Reason for current visit: On arrival  James could barely speak or comprehend what he was being asked. He displayed a significant loss of motor control on his right side  including his right face  arm  and leg. His gait was unsteady  and he fell to the right when he attempted to walk.  A detailed patient case like this would allow the students to delve deep into cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic stroke  hemorrhagic stroke  transient ischemic attacks  and related conditions. This case  in particular  seems to depict an ischemic stroke  given James's symptoms and medical history. Students can explore factors like the importance of timing in stroke diagnosis and treatment  the role of risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  atrial fibrillation  and smoking  and the implications of medication non-compliance.
Stroke,10,70,"Case Study: Middle-aged African American Male with Suspected Stroke  Patient Information:  Mr. Darryl Johnson  a 54-year-old African American male  is the case we are considering for this study.  Chief Complaint:  The patient was brought into the emergency department by his wife  who reported that her husband was having difficulty speaking and was unable to raise his left arm upward. These symptoms started suddenly approximately two hours ago.  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension  for which he was prescribed Lisinopril. Mr. Johnson had been experiencing occasional headaches  which he tended to ignore. He is also obese (BMI: 33.5)  and has a history of smoking  approximately one pack of cigarettes daily  for the past 20 years. He does not engage in regular exercise and prefers a diet high in fat. He doesn't consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. The family history reveals that the patient's father suffered a stroke at the age of 62.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient seemed alert but anxious. His blood pressure on admission was elevated (180/100mmHg). His speech was slurred  and he had difficulty in moving his left arm and leg. He was overweight with a weight of 105 kg (231 lbs) and height of 175 cm (5'9""""). Pulse rate was at 92 bpm  and O2 saturation was stable at 97%.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  Considering the patient's symptoms and history  an immediate preliminary diagnosis of stroke was suggested - likely an ischemic stroke given the abrupt onset of symptoms.   This case study is designed to highlight the importance of quick diagnosis and treatment for potential stroke patients. It also emphasizes the need for managing risk factors in patients to prevent critical health events such as strokes. Appropriate measures such as lifestyle changes  antihypertensive medication  and smoking cessation should be discussed.  NB: The case takes into account epidemiological factors affecting stroke prevalence. African American males are disproportionately affected by stroke  with higher risk factors including diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and obesity. As per several studies  African Americans have almost twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with whites. The aim of the case is adherence to reality and promoting health equity and social determinacy in health discourse."
Stroke,10,71,Case Report: Stroke   Patient Information:  Mr. James Smith is a 68-year-old African-American male who presents with his wife to the emergency department. They reside in an urban area where he is retired and enjoys spending time with family and playing chess.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is known for hypertension for the past 10 years  well-controlled on medication  and type 2 diabetes for 5 years  under control with diet and medication. He also has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He does not drink alcohol and has no allergies. His father also had a history of stroke and hypertension  both maternal and paternal grandparents had diabetes.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith's wife  a primary school teacher  noticed that over breakfast Mr. Smith suddenly stopped midway through his sentence  looked puzzled  and started struggling with his words which led to difficulty in speaking. She also noticed drooping of the right side of his face. Furthermore  she stated that he had been complaining of a severe headache since morning. He was unable to lift his right arm and was walking unsteadily. All these provoked his wife to panic  and she immediately sought help from the nearest hospital under suspicion of a stroke. Mr. Smith hadn't observed any change in his vision  and besides the headache  he hadn't noticed any early symptoms. He didn't experience any form of unconsciousness  and he does not take any anticoagulants.  NB: The case represents a typical stroke presentation due to its sudden onset. It includes facial drooping  arm weakness  speech difficulty  imbalance  and severe headache  which is common but not necessarily present. These signs and symptoms adhere to the FAST (Face  Arm  Speech  Time) acronym often used to help detect and enhance responsiveness to stroke victim needs. Demographics reflect statistics showing that stroke is more prevalent in men  older individuals  African-Americans  and those with a family history of stroke. It is more common in individuals with comorbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and a history of smoking.
Stroke,10,72,"Case Report: Stroke  Patient Demographics: Patient Name: Anonymous  Age: 67  Gender: Male  Race/Ethnicity: African American   Past Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  5-year past of Type 2 diabetes  and has been a smoker for the past 25 years. He has been irregular with his medications and does not follow up regularly with his primary care physician. Due to the onset of persistent cough  he visited his physician 1 month ago where a chest X-ray was conducted. However  the patient has no record of pulmonary conditions or cardiovascular diseases excluding hypertension. No additional significant medical history has been recorded.  Presentation and Key Complaints: The patient was brought into the ER by his neighbor who found him slumped over in his home. On presentation  the patient was found to be conscious but confused  dysarthric with mild slurring of speech. His neighbor reported that he had been complaining of severe headache and dizziness since early morning and refused to see a doctor  considering these as """"common issues.""""  On the initial examination  the patient was unable to move his right limbs and there was significant drooping on the right side of the face  confirming a left hemispheric stroke. His blood pressure on arrival was 180/105 mmHg. Other vitals such as heart rate and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Furthermore  the patient complained of visual disturbances  particularly on the right side. A neurological examination revealed hemianopia.   This case is designed to highlight the high prevalence of stroke among African American men  who have almost twice the risk of having a first stroke compared to Caucasians. The case also emphasizes common risk factors such as hypertension  smoking  and diabetes  and the crucial role of medication compliance.  Please note: While this case is customized to address common stroke demographic trends in the USA  stroke risks and trends can vary worldwide."
Stroke,10,73,Case Report Name: A Case of Acute Cerebrovascular Accident  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Vannessa Johnson Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Demographic Details:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American female residing in the urban part of Boston  MA. She lives alone but has a close-knit community of friends and weekly support from her daughter who lives nearby.  Past Medical History: She has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years  managed with lifestyle modification and Lisinopril tablet 5mg daily. Mrs. Johnson also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is kept under control via Metformin tablet 500mg twice daily. She's a non-smoker and has been moderately sedentary for the past 10 years since her retirement. There is no known history of any neurodegenerative diseases.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Johnson came to the ER with her daughter after a sudden onset of left sided weakness and difficulty speaking that started approximately two hours ago while reading a book. Mrs. Johnson has no prior history of such events. There is no report of a headache  vertigo or loss of consciousness.  Additional Notes: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  stroke risk is higher among African American women. Hypertension and diabetes are two highly prevalent stroke risk factors in this demographic. Primary hypertension is found to be a most common risk factor for stroke in several studies. Additionally  the CDC recognizes sedentary behavior  diabetes  and hypertension as some of the key risk factors for stroke  particularly for African American women. Hence  the case of Mrs. Johnson is aimed at presenting a common stroke scenario  where major controllable risk factors are present in a demographic that is at high risk. This case is expected to give students a realistic learning encounter on managing stroke in elderly patients with common comorbid conditions.  Related Studies for Reference: - Kissela  B. M.

Stroke,10,74,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics: Subject is a 66-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith  recently retired  lives with his wife  and is predominantly sedentary. Mr. Smith smoked for 3 decades  although he quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol rarely and denies any illicit substance use. He is nondiabetic but has a history of hypertension which he has managed with Lisinopril for 8 years.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  following which he quit smoking. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and has been receiving statin therapy since. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease  as his father reportedly died suddenly  aged 62. There is no known family history of stroke.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith arrived at the emergency department accompanied by his wife. He mentioned that he woke up this morning with weakness in the left side of his body and difficulty speaking  which led him to visit the hospital. He reported no headache  seizure  loss of consciousness  or any other symptoms. On physical examination  Mr. Smith had a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 76 beats per minute  and increased respiratory rate of 20 per minute.  The patient had facial droop and dysarthria  with markedly decreased power in the left upper and lower limb (2/5). He was able to comprehend the doctor's instructions and could follow through with right limb movements. However  he had a noticeable difficulty in naming objects handed to him and had an issue repeating simple sentences.  Neurological examination suggested a problem in the right cortical region  dominated by left-sided weakness and non-fluent aphasia  indicative of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient underwent a CT scan and other necessary neurodiagnostic tests  and the case was escalated to the neurology department for management with necessary interventions like thrombolytic therapy  dependent on the guidelines and patient status.   Teaching Point: This case bases itself on the literature notation that stroke is more common in older people (over 55)  men  and in those with a personal or family history of stroke. It is also more prevalent amongst smokers and people with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Thus  focusing on the diagnosis  management  and crucial time-saving strategies when dealing with stroke becomes an important part of medical education.
Stroke,10,75,Case Study: Stroke  Patient Information:  Patient: Mr. James Davis Age: 65 years  Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 55  on Lisinopril 10 mg daily 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed at age 60  on Metformin 500mg twice daily 3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 3 years ago  on Simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime 4. History of tobacco use: 1 pack/day - quit 10 years ago 5. Family history of stroke: Father had his first stroke at age 67  Presenting Complaints:  1. Sudden onset of slurred speech. 2. Weakness on the right side of the body  including the face  arm  and leg. 3. Trouble seeing with the right eye. 4. Difficulty walking due to dizziness and loss of balance.  Comments:  This case involves an African American male  aged 65 years old. The patient falls within the most affected demographic group for stroke as  according to literature  stroke risk increases with age and African Americans are at higher risk compared to other races. The comorbidities like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia are common among stroke patients and the symptoms presented are typical of those experienced during a stroke. This is a crucial case that contributes to understanding the complexities of stroke diagnosis and management among high-risk individuals.
Stroke,10,76,Case Report: Acute Ischemic Stroke  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Luis Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  retired schoolteacher  married with three grown-up children.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  for which he is on anti-hypertensive and statin medication. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years back and is under oral anti-diabetic medications. He has a 25 pack-year smoking history but had quit smoking 3 years ago. His father had a history of myocardial infarction at 74 years old.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez's wife noticed that he suddenly developed slurred speech  weakness in the right side of his body  and a difficulty in maintaining his balance  prompting her to bring him in. Mr. Rodriguez also reported a sudden-onset severe headache unlike any he had experienced before.   Note: This training case was designed keeping in mind the literature-identified demographic representation: Stroke is more prevalent among the elderly  and men are slightly more affected than women. Additionally  Hispanic and African American populations have a higher incidence of stroke. The common risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  and a history of smoking have been included. A positive family history is also a risk factor that has been represented in the case. 
Stroke,10,77,Case Subject: Mr. Robert Johnson  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Robert Johnson is a 69-year-old African-American male  living in the suburban area of Philadelphia. He's a retired teacher living with his spouse. His socioeconomic status is middle class and he's a non-smoker. He occasionally consumes alcohol.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known history of Hypertension  for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril but has been inconsistent with medication compliance. His father died of a stroke at the age of 72 and there is a familial history of cardiovascular diseases with some of the male members of his extended family. He does not exercise regularly and his diet often includes high-fat foods.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of slurred speech  right-sided facial droop  and right upper extremity weakness that started around 2 hours ago while he was at home reading a newspaper. He also mentioned a mild headache but denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or history of a similar episode in the past. His wife  who brought him to the hospital  reports that Mr. Johnson seemed confused during the car ride  not immediately recognizing familiar surroundings.  This case is representative of a patient population that is at a higher risk for stroke (older African-American men) and highlights the importance of risk factor management (hypertension) and of recognizing the cardinal signs of stroke so as to ensure swift  appropriate medical action.
Stroke,10,78,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mrs. Juanita Gonzales  a 65-year-old African American female  with a BMI of 32. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone in an urban community. She is a widow with two adult children living out of state. English is her second language  but she is fluent; Spanish is her primary language. She is of low socio-economic status and relies heavily on her Social Security income.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Gonzales suffers from chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both are under fair control with medication. She is moderately obese and leads a largely sedentary lifestyle. She has had mild episodes of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the past  but did not seek medical attention for them. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history  but quit 15 years ago. She drinks alcohol occasionally. Family history includes a brother who died of stroke at the age of 68.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Gonzales presents to the emergency department accompanied by a neighbor. She has been experiencing sudden weakness in her right arm and leg for the past 2 hours  difficulty speaking  and transient vision blurriness in her right eye  which have not improved. She has also mentioned experiencing a severe headache  which is unusual for her.  Note: This patient profile aims to take into account various factors; age  ethnicity  sex  socio-economic status  and lifestyle  that influence the incidence and outcome of stroke  as discussed in medical literature. African American individuals  lower-income individuals  women  and individuals aged 65 and above are at increased risk for stroke. Chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking and alcohol use also significantly contribute to stroke risk  making Mrs. Gonzales an ideal patient to illustrate these points for medical students studying stroke.   This case report could serve as a basis for discussing the importance of timely medical attention  the role of TIAs as a warning sign for stroke  the impact of socio-economic status and cultural background on health outcomes  and the prevention and management of stroke risk factors.
Stroke,10,79,Case Report:  Patient Information: Ms. Jones  a 72-year-old African-American woman  presented herself to the emergency department. She lives independently  is a non-smoker  and has no history of substance abuse. She is engaged in a moderate level of physical activity and primarily follows a balanced diet.  Medical History: The core elements of her past medical history include hypertension  which is well-controlled on medication  diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) on metformin  and prior transient ischemic attack five years ago with no residual deficits. She admits non-compliance to medications sometimes due to her forgetfulness. No history of surgery or hospitalizations before other than for her childbirth during her early 30s. No known allergies.   Key Complaints: The patient was having lunch with her daughter when she suddenly developed slurred speech. She then experienced right-sided weakness attempting to stand up. The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes  and then mostly resolved  although she still feels slight weakness in her right arm. She denies any headache  dizziness  visual or hearing disturbances  or chest pains. Her daughter  panicked by the attack  summoned the ambulance.  Presentation: On arrival  she was noted to be alert but anxious  with a mild aphasia. Her vitals showed BP 190/100  pulse 80 and regular  respirations 20  and temperature 97.8 F. The physical exam revealed mild right upper extremity weakness (4/5)  facial droop on the right side  and moderate dysarthria. The rest of the neurologic exam appeared unremarkable  with no evident sensory or coordination deficits.   Rationale: This case mainly targets and reflects the typical demographic associated with stroke risk- older adults  African-Americans  and individuals with chronic illnesses like hypertension and DMT2  both of which are significant risk factors for cerebrovascular events. Also  it includes elements of lifestyle choices – physical activity  diet - which can either increase or decrease an individual's risk for stroke  depending on the particulars.   Focus for discussion can be laid on:  1. Early identification and management of stroke. 2. Urgent management of hypertension and its long-term link to stroke risk. 3. Importance of medication compliance. 4. Deeper discussions of risk factors  allowing students to contemplate prevention strategies both on an individual and community scale.
Stroke,10,80,Case Study: Stroke  Patient Information:   Ms. Brenda Johnson is a 65-year-old African American woman  currently residing in a suburban neighborhood in Atlanta  Georgia. She is a retired teacher  living alone but has a supportive network of her two adult children and neighbors. Ms. Johnson is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol socially. She does not have any known food or drug allergies.  Past Medical History:   Ms. Johnson has had hypertension for the past 15 years  which has been well-controlled with Lisinopril. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  managed with Metformin and lifestyle changes. She also has a history of Hyperlipidemia  treated with Atorvastatin. There is no history of prior strokes  transient ischemic attacks  or systemic vascular events. Her mother suffered a stroke at the age of 75.  Key Complaints:   Ms. Johnson arrived at the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking  which started about an hour ago while she was having her breakfast. She also complained of a sudden headache and reported feeling dizzy. Her daughter  noticing her symptoms  quickly called the ambulance.  Rationale:  Ms. Johnson's case accurately represents the major demographic details pertinent to stroke  as reported in medical literature. Stroke disproportionately affects older individuals (around the age of 65 as in our patient)  and is influenced by hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia – all conditions present in our patient. Additionally  African Americans are more likely to suffer from strokes  and females are slightly more likely to suffer from strokes than males  particularly at older ages. Furthermore  the sudden onset of left-sided weakness  difficulty with speech  accompanied by a sudden headache and dizziness correlates accurately with common symptoms seen in stroke patients. This  aligned with her risk factors  contribute to a high clinical suspicion of stroke.
Stroke,10,81,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. George Roberts Age: 70 years Sex: Male Race: African American  Education: Bachelor's Degree in Commerce Occupation: Retired Bank Manager  Residence: Urban city  Chicago  Past Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a long history of uncontrolled hypertension for over 20 years  highly irregular in medication adherence. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and has been under medication for the same. He had a myocardial infarction scare about 5 years ago which required a coronary angioplasty procedure. He is also known to have hyperlipidemia. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit approximately 10 years ago.   Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the ER in the late evening by his wife. He presented with a sudden onset of severe headache  dropped right corner of the mouth  slurred speech  and weakness in the right arm and leg noted by his spouse  starting about 30 minutes before arrival. He also reported a feeling of dizziness and some blurring of vision prior to the onset of the headache.   This case highlights stroke  particularly  an ischemic stroke given the acute onset of focal neurological deficits. The suspected risk factors include the patient's age  race  uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  prior coronary artery disease  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history. Studies have shown that African American men over 65 years  like Mr. Roberts  have a higher incidence of stroke than their white counterparts. The emphasis should be on the importance of early recognition and urgent treatment in enhancing the prognosis for stroke patients. The need for better management of modifiable risk factors should also be stressed.    (References:  1. Collins TC  Lunos S  Carlson T  et al.

Stroke,10,82,Patient Profile: Name: Ms. Garcia Age: 67 years old Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired elementary school teacher  Past Medical History: - Hypertension  - Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Hyperlipidemia  - Non-smoker  moderate alcohol intake  - No history of previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks - Mother reportedly had a stroke at the age of 75  Presenting Complaint: Patient arrived in the emergency department with sudden onset of difficulty in speaking and understanding others. She and her son also note a distinct droop on the left side of her face and weakness in her left arm. The symptoms progressed over the last 2 hours and they both denied any history of trauma or fall.  Key Clinical Findings: Upon examination  Ms. Garcia showed confusion and had a notable facial asymmetry. She exhibited motor weakness on the left side of her body. Her speech was slurred and she had difficulty understanding verbal commands. Her blood pressure was 160/96 mm Hg. An NIH stroke scale was computed showing a moderate stroke. Preliminary blood tests revealed high blood sugar and lipid levels.  Case Discussion:  This case aims to discuss the diagnosis  management  and prevention of cerebrovascular accidents  specifically ischemic stroke. The patient presents features typical for stroke  such as acute onset of neurological symptoms including speech disturbance and unilateral weakness. Moreover  she has multiple risk factors for stroke  including age  race  hypertension  diabetes  and family history. Thus  learners should be able to correlate the history and physical exam findings to potential diagnoses and proceed with necessary investigations  such as brain imaging. Discussion should also extend to interventions including thrombolytic therapy  management of risk factors  and comprehensive rehabilitation plans. Results from this case can be extrapolated to inform stroke prevention strategies in high-risk populations.
Stroke,10,83,CASE REPORT  Patient Presentation:  - Name: Mr. Samuel - Age: 70 years - Sex: Male - Race: African-American  - Occupation: Retired  Past Medical History:  Mr. Samuel is a known hypertensive for the past 15 years  under medication. He has a history of smoking 1 pack per day for the last 35 years  but quit 10 years ago. He has occasional alcohol intake. He is also known to have Type II Diabetes for 10 years and is under medication.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Samuel presents with sudden onset of weakness in the right side of his body which began around three hours prior to hospital admission. He also reports difficulty speaking and an episode of dizziness accompanied by a severe headache. Additionally  he mentions experiencing sudden blurred vision in his right eye. His daughter noticed the right side of his face drooping when he tried to smile.  NOTE:  - Male patients represent almost 52% of stroke incidents. The rate of stroke is about twice as high for African-Americans as for Caucasians. - Major risk factors are appropriately represented  including age  hypertension  diabetes  and smoking history. - The presented symptoms represent classical warning signs of a stroke- sudden numbness or weakness of the face  arm  or leg (especially on one side of the body)  confusion  trouble speaking or understanding speech  difficulty seeing in one or both eyes  severe headache with no known cause.  Case reports like this one can be used to foster a discussion about the diagnosis  management  and prevention of stroke  as well as to explore the complexities and disparities in stroke incidence based on race and socioeconomic status.
Stroke,10,84,Case Report Title: A Case Study of Posterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke   Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Thompson Gender: Male Age: 62 Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Engineer Home Address: Chicago  USA  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thompson presented himself to the ER complaining of sudden headache  vertigo  blurred vision  and difficulty in swallowing for the last couple of hours. He also remarked about feeling unstable and mentioned a recent fall without loss of consciousness.  Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medication for these conditions for the past 7 years. He is a former smoker (quitted 10 years back)  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a family history of stroke. There is no known history of heart diseases or stroke.  Relevance to Population Demographics: According to the literature  stroke disproportionately affects the elderly population  with individuals over the age of 55 comprising the majority of reported cases. African-American males  much like Mr. Thompson  are particularly at high risk due to the higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in this sub-population. It is also known that individuals with a family history of stroke are more likely to have a higher risk themselves.  Case Objectives: 1. To familiarize medical students with the clinical presentation of an ischemic stroke. 2. To understand the role of past medical history in stroke risk. 3. To imbibe the skills needed to diagnose stroke confidently and promptly. 4. To learn about the necessary steps in developing a management plan for a patient experiencing a stroke.  5. To highlight the importance of relating clinical practice with population demographics and a patient's personal life  understanding their influence in predisposing illnesses.
Stroke,10,85,Case Report: --- Patient Information:  Mr. Johnson  a 72-year-old African American male.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson is an ex-smoker and has had uncontrolled hypertension for the past seven years. He is on anti-hypertensive medication but admits to forgetting to take his medication at times. He has no known allergies  underwent an appendectomy at the age of 30  and has a family history of stroke with his mother suffering a stroke at the age of 75.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson was brought to the emergency department the morning of 5/11/2022  by his wife after he woke up with difficulty speaking and numbness on the left side of his body. His wife reported that he was fine when he went to bed last night. The symptoms had been present for around 3 hours by the time of arrival at the hospital.   On further inquiry  she also reported that Mr. Johnson had complained of experiencing occasional episodes of dizziness in the past few weeks but did not seek medical assistance as he attributed it to his age and 'stress at work.'  --- **Representative Notes** This case is representative of stroke  with a patient coming from the most commonly affected demographics. Stroke primarily affects people aged 65 years and older (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  2020). Furthermore  African-Americans are nearly twice as likely to experience a first-ever stroke as white Americans (American Stroke Association  2020). Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke (American Heart Association  2020). The patient's non-adherence to medication is a commonly encountered problem in managing high blood pressure.
Stroke,10,86,Case Report:    Patient Demographics: Patient is a 70-year-old African American female with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31 indicating obesity. She is a retiree formerly in the teaching profession and lives with her husband.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension managed with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. The patient has been non-compliant with her medications at times and has occasionally been lost to follow-up for her ongoing conditions. She has a 20-year history of smoking one pack per day but quit ten years ago.  Presenting Complaint: The patient's husband rushes her to the emergency room with an acute onset of right-sided body weakness and slurring of speech which started about an hour prior to hospital arrival. The husband reported that his wife suddenly had difficulty lifting her right arm while having breakfast and was unable to articulate words clearly. No history of direct trauma  blackout  seizures  or previous similar episodes.  The selected patient demographics were chosen based on the fact that stroke incidence is disproportionately high among African Americans compared to other races. Additionally  stroke risk increases with age  and it is more prevalent in women. Obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and history of smoking are all well-established risk factors for stroke.
Stroke,10,87,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired Mechanic Smoking Status: Ex-smoker  quit 8 years ago Alcohol Consumption: Occasional   Presenting Complaints:  John Doe arrived at the hospital accompanying his daughter who noticed her father displaying unusual speech problems. She said he started slurring his words during a conversation and the right side of his face seemed to droop. He also reported sudden weakness in his right arm.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: John has been on medication for high blood pressure for the past 10 years. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 8 years ago. His diabetes has been generally well-controlled with metformin. 3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 5 years ago  currently on statin therapy. 4. History of tobacco use: John was a smoker for over 30 years but quit 8 years ago.  He has no known allergies and his family history includes a sister who had a stroke at the age of 62.  Demographics:  The selection of a 65-year-old African American male is aligned with statistical data suggesting that strokes disproportionately affect individuals within this demographic. Studies indicate that African Americans are more heavily affected by stroke than any other racial groups within the U.S. Additionally  stroke risk increases markedly with age  particularly after age 55. Males tend to have a higher risk of stroke  but this differential narrows with increasing age. Comorbid risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia are also more prevalent in this demographic.                                                                            Thus  John Doe helps to accurately represent a significant portion of the stroke patient population. His case could be used to underline the importance of risk factor modification in preventing poor outcomes in stroke. Additionally  it serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing the classic symptoms: facial drooping  arm weakness  and speech difficulties  in a timely manner. 
Stroke,10,88,Case Report:  Patient Information:   - Name: Mr. Robert Johnson - Age: 66 years old - Gender: Male - Race/Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired Trade Union Worker - Marital Status: Married - Weight: 220 lbs - Height: 6'0''  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension (diagnosed for 10 years  taking Lisinopril 20 mg daily) - Type 2 Diabetes (managed with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily) - Hyperlipidemia (under treatment with Atorvastatin 20mg daily) - Smoking history of 30 pack-years (quit smoking 4 years ago) - No known allergies  Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presents to the emergency department brought in by his wife  who reported that he suddenly developed difficulty in speaking and weakness on the right side of his body roughly an hour prior. He denies any headache  trauma  dizziness  or loss of consciousness. Patient's wife confirms that he had taken his morning dose of prescribed medications and seemed normal before the episode. His last normal was approximately 1 hour before arrival at the hospital.  Justifications:     Based on the literature  African Americans have greater incidence and mortality rate from stroke than Caucasians. Stroke is also more common in men than in women. Certain risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking are commonly associated with stroke. The age group of 60-80 years holds the highest risk for stroke than the other age groups.
Stroke,10,89,Case Vignette:  Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department. He is a retired college professor living in urban California with his wife. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. He has been on antihypertensive medications  metformin  and statins for the last five years. However  his compliance with medication and diet control has been inconsistent.  Chief Complaints: The patient has come with a complaint of sudden onset weakness on the right side of his body and difficulty in speaking  which began 3 hours ago while he was having breakfast. His wife also noticed that his mouth was deviated to the left side.  According to the literature  stroke is more common in older adults (aged 65 and above) and among African Americans due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. The case also highlights the importance of recognizing the classical symptoms of stroke  i.e.  sudden onset weakness (hemiparesis) and speech disturbance. It aims to provide students with an opportunity to evaluate the importance of timely recognition and management of stroke. They can explore topics such as determining stroke severity  immediate management  lifestyle modifications  and secondary prevention strategies for such patients. Additionally  this case can be utilized to discuss the vital role of caregivers in managing chronic diseases and in identifying emergency situations.
Stroke,10,90,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. Alfred is a 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Alfred was brought into the emergency department by his daughter. She explains that she found him earlier this morning with slurred speech  drooling out the right side of the mouth and unable to move his right arm and leg.  Past Medical History:  * Hypertension diagnosed 15 years back; under medication (Lisinopril). * Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago; maintains a relatively controlled blood sugar with Metformin. * No known history of cardiac disease  recurrent headaches  strokes  or seizures. * No prior surgeries. * No known allergies. * Current smoker with 30 pack-years smoking history. * Rarely consumes alcohol.   Key Complaints:  On arrival  Mr. Alfred presents with:  1. Slurred speech: The patient talks with difficulty and his words are not clear. 2. Facial droop: Drooling from the right side of the mouth. 3. Right-sided weakness: The patient is unable to move his right arm and leg. 4. Confusion: The patient seems disoriented with time and place.  The above case presentation is designed considering demographic representation. The patient is an African American  as literature shows that stroke risk is higher among Black individuals compared to Whites primarily due to a higher prevalence of risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore  the patient’s age  gender  and smoking habits follow the general trends found in literature showing increased susceptibility to stroke in older male smokers. It is crucial for the case to depict the typical clinical manifestations of stroke to help students identify potential cases in the future.
Stroke,10,91,"Case Report:  Patient Information:   - Demographics: Ms. Fernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  retired English teacher  living alone in a suburban neighborhood. - Past Medical History: Diagnosed with Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  12 years ago. Regular visits to her primary care physician  with low adherence to medications. No known allergies.  Chief Complaint:   - Difficulty in speaking and right-sided weakness. The patient was found in the morning by her caregiver on routine visit  after her last known normal condition about 14 hours prior  when she had made a telephone call to her son.  On further Interviews/ Investigations:  - Patient had not been taking her medications (Metformin and Lisinopril) consistently for the past week because she felt """"quite fine."""" - The caregiver reports Ms. Fernandez had complained of a severe headache the last night  which she dismissed as stress-related. - No other complaints were reported or observed.  This case offers a scenario of acute ischemic stroke  a common form of stroke. Ms. Fernandez's ethnicity and age range align with higher stroke risks  as observed in study data. Her past medical history of poorly managed hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  patchy medication adherence  living alone  and limited knowledge of stroke symptoms are notable risk factors.  Students will need to consider immediate neurology consult  controlling blood pressure  maintaining normalized blood glucose  and the window for thrombolytic therapy. The case also invites discussion on the implications of delayed presentation  the importance of medication adherence  stroke risk factors  and the need for community education to recognize stroke symptoms."
Stroke,10,92,Case Report  Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African-American man  a retired construction worker  married with two children.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with hypertension eight years ago  has type-II diabetes  and a history of hyperlipidemia. He was a smoker but quit five years ago. He has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of unilateral weakness in his right limb  slurred speech  and facial drooping. He started experiencing these symptoms while having breakfast which  according to his wife  was approximately 1 hour before presenting to the ER.   (Framework Info: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  stroke is most common in individuals over the age of 65  and the risk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for black people as for white people. Furthermore  conditions like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia are common risk factors for stroke. Hence  this case provides a clinically rich and demographically accurate case scenario for the students to learn from.)

Social History: Mr. Lee is a widower living alone. He used to work as a construction worker but has been retired for the past decade.  Relevance of Patient Demographics:  According to the literature  stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. It is more prevalent in males compared to females. African-Americans are found to have a significantly higher risk of stroke compared to the Caucasian population. Age is a prominent risk factor  with those over 65 years most susceptible. A history of hypertension  smoking  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle are also common in stroke patients.  Learning Objectives:  1. Recognize  evaluate  and manage stroke symptoms 2. Understand the risk factors and incidence of stroke among different demographic groups 3. Understand the significance of time-management in acute stroke interventions 4. Familiarize with contraindications of certain acute therapies 5. Plan appropriate long-term management strategies considering comorbid conditions  Discussion Points:  1. Why is it important to recognize stroke symptoms immediately? 2. How does Mr. Lee's demographic and medical history place him at higher risk for stroke? 3. What immediate actions should be taken in Mr. Lee's situation in the ED? 4. How to educate patients like Mr. Lee about stroke symptoms and when to seek medical help?   Teaching Note:  This case presents a highly probable case considering the risk factors and demographics. Early recognition and prompt management of stroke are essential  as the saying goes  """"Time is Brain."""" The students should think carefully about the management options considering the patient's comorbidities. Teaching should emphasize the importance of patient education and follow-up to prevent secondary stroke. "

Sudden unilateral numbness and weakness are clearly noticeable on his face  arm  and leg. Concurrently  he is experiencing a sudden onset of confusion and difficulty in speaking and understanding speech.  Upon admission  Mr. King mentioned a sudden severe headache with no known cause  and he described it as the worst headache of his life. His wife also reports that he complained of dizziness and loss of balance and coordination shortly before the onset of his current symptoms. Previously  he had episodes consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) although it was not formally diagnosed. Over the past month  he reportedly had instances of transient loss of vision in his left eye.   Physical Examination and Diagnosis:  With the presenting symptoms and given his medical history  patient Mr. King requires immediate neurological evaluation. Blood pressure at admission - 190/110 mmHg which is significantly higher than normal. Physical examination and diagnostic tests including but not limited to neuroimaging  vascular imaging  and heart function tests should be taken into account to confirm a possible diagnosis of Cerebrovascular Stroke for Mr. King. Consultation with a stroke multidisciplinary team should also be considered for the implementation of appropriate acute treatment measures and secondary prevention strategies.   Case conclusion:  Through this case  the students will identify common presenting complaints and risk factors of stroke  including hypertension  diabetes  smoking  possible previous transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). This case will also cover quick decision-making skills in stroke diagnosis and management  as """"time is brain"""" in stroke scenarios.   Finally  the students should understand the importance of long-term management plans for stroke victims  focusing on medication adherence  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups."
