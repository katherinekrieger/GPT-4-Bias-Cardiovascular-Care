Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,1,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: Patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presenting to the ER  with a new onset of severe chest pain. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife in downtown  Maryland. He smokes half a pack cigarettes daily for the last 40 years. His alcohol consumption is minimal. As per literature  Caucasian males over sixty years of age are more susceptible to get Pulmonary Embolism.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a known medical history of heart diseases  specifically  hypertensive cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation  maintained on Coumadin for five years. He also has Type 2 Diabetes  managed with oral Metformin. Mr. Doe undergone total hip replacement surgery two years ago.  Current Medical Presentation: His symptoms include sudden onset of sharp  stabbing chest pain  dyspnea  tachypnea  hemoptysis  and light-headedness. These increase suspicion of acute Pulmonary Embolism. The severity of the symptoms varies  with the chest pain being worse when he takes a deep breath. The symptoms started four hours ago. No known allergies were reported.  Risk Factors:  Given his past medical history of atrial fibrillation  orthopedic surgery  and continued smoking habit  Mr. Doe falls within a high-risk group for the development of Pulmonary Embolism  a life-threatening complication of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). His prolonged immobility postsurgery  long-term smoking  and non-compliance to anticoagulant therapy are significant risk factors contributing to his current condition.  Given the above symptoms  demographic  past medical history  and risk factors  urgent diagnostic procedures such as D-dimer testing and Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) are required to confirm the diagnosis.  In Conclusion  the demographics  medical history and lifestyle choices of Mr. Doe has predisposed him to the development of Pulmonary Embolism. His case highlights the need for stringent monitoring and management of lifestyle and chronic conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,2,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Female Patient   Presentation:   I would like to discuss the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female patient  Mrs. Ann Smith  who presented in the emergency room with symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Despite no past history of hypertension  diabetes  or any heart diseases  Mrs. Smith is a former smoker with a 40-pack-a-year smoking history. She had a right total knee arthroplasty four weeks ago  which is a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism.  She presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath  right-sided chest pain and coughing up small amounts of blood. She was also mildly hypotensive. On physical examination  she appeared mildly cyanotic with increased respiratory rate and decreased oxygen saturation.  In terms of demographic distribution  this case aligns with the global epidemiology of pulmonary embolism. The disorder is more common in elderly patients (40 years or older) with a female preponderance. The risk increases in individuals who have undergone major surgery  particularly orthopedic surgeries  within the preceding month. Epidemiological data also shows a higher risk in patients with a history of smoking.  In conclusion  demographic information and past medical history significantly contribute to the identification of patients at high risk for pulmonary embolism. Mrs. Smith’s age  gender  recent knee arthroplasty  and history of smoking are all important risk factors to consider in her management plan. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management in such high-risk patients can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality associated with acute pulmonary embolism.   Thank you for your attention. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,3,Title: Presentation of a Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  Patient Information: Mrs. RF  a 55-year-old Caucasian female  presents with an acute episode of breathlessness and chest pain.  History of Present Illness: For the past few hours  Mrs. RF has been reporting sudden and severe chest pain. She describes it as a sharp  stabbing pain under her rib-cage that worsens with deep breathing. Along with this  she has been experiencing shortness of breath  wheezing  cough and lightheadedness. There has also been an unexplained episode of hemoptysis.  Past Medical History: She has a significant medical history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and obesity (BMI 31 kg/m2). Recently  she was on bed rest due to a fractured ankle.  She denies any history of smoking or lung diseases but admits that she does not exercise regularly. She also has a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Current Medications: Her current medications include metformin 500mg BID for diabetes  calcium and vitamin D supplements  and estrogen and progesterone for HRT.  Socioeconomic Status: She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband in the suburbs. Their financial situation is stable.  Risk Factors: Notably  her risk factors for PE include obesity  type 2 diabetes  prolonged immobilization due to recent ankle fracture  and her ongoing HRT. These factors  together with her recent immobility  possibly contribute to her hypercoagulable state and development of a thrombus.  Based on her medical history  clinical presentation  and risk factors  Mrs. RF was suspected to have an acute PE. For a definitive diagnosis  requisite investigations such as D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiography  and possibly ventilation-perfusion lung scan  were arranged promptly.     Further treatment  mainly consisting of anticoagulation  will be guided by her investigation results  PE severity  and overall clinical condition.  References: 1. Konstantinides  S. V.  Meyer  G.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,4,Title: Case Presentation- Acute Pulmonary Embolism  [Slide 1] Introduction  We will be discussing a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath.  [Slide 2] Demographics  The patient is a retired school teacher who lives independently in suburban area. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and has no history of drug abuse. She has been living with hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past ten years  controlled with medications.   [Slide 3] Past Medical History  Her other medical history includes obesity with a body mass index of 32  hyperlipidemia  and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from a year ago. She has been compliant with her prescribed Oral anticoagulant therapy for DVT but stopped it two weeks ago due to prolonged bleeding from a minor cut. She had no known allergies.  [Slide 4]  Presentation  The patient reported sudden onset chest pain that was deep  severe  and radiating towards her left arm. She also reported palpitations  light-headedness  and difficulty breathing that has been worsening over the past few hours. There were no associated symptoms of fever  cough  night sweats  weight loss  recent travel  or surgical procedures.  [Slide 5] Interpretation  Given the patient's demographic and medical history  her symptoms are consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Her risk factors include her extended age  personal history of DVT  her discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy  obesity  and other comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes. In such cases  immediate diagnostic evaluation with CT pulmonary angiography and D-Dimer testing is necessary.   [Slide 6] Conclusion  This patient's case demonstrates the importance of recognizing the classic symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism in the context of high-risk factors. Early recognition and treatment are essential for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with PE. Furthermore  it emphasizes the importance of compliance with anticoagulation therapy for patients with a history of DVT.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,5,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 52-Year-Old African American Female  Introduction:  The patient is a 52-year-old African American female who presents with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain worsening with deep inspiration. She also describes experiencing a recent unexplained cough  some episodes producing blood-streaked sputum. Additionally  she reports associated light-headedness and feelings of anxiety but denies any fever  chills  or recent illnesses.   Demographics: The patient lives in the urban setting of Chicago  Illinois. She works as an accountant with a sedentary lifestyle. She is a non-smoker but has a family history of heart disease. The patient is overweight  with a BMI of 29.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication. She was recently immobilized due to an ankle fracture 3 months ago and spent a significant time in a cast  with limited mobility during that period.   Recent Clinical History: Over the last week  the patient has noticed increased swelling and warmth in her right leg. The leg also has a visibly distended vein  which raised her concerns.   Evaluation: Vital signs reveal tachypnea (rapid breathing rate) and tachycardia (increased heart rate). On examination  the patient’s right leg was swollen  erythematous and tender to touch. Cardiac examination confirmed a tachycardic  but regular  heart rhythm. Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally but no wheezes  crackles  or other abnormal sounds. The rest of the physical examination was benign.  Conclusion: Taking into account the patient's clinical presentation- symptoms of shortness of breath  chest pain  history of recent prolonged immobilization (risk factor for Deep Vein thrombosis)  and physical examination findings  there is a strong suspicion for Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Consequently  she was sent for immediate diagnostic imaging and blood tests  including D-dimer levels  to confirm the diagnosis and guide the treatment process.   The patient is representative of the wider disease population as literature suggests that PE is more common in African Americans  individuals over the age of 40  those with obesity  immobility  hypertension  and a family history of venous thromboembolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,6,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism   I will be presenting the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian female who presented with symptoms indicative of acute pulmonary embolism.   The patient lives in a rural area in Northwest America. She's retired from her career as a primary school teacher. She is a widow with no children  though she does reside with her younger sister who assists her as needed.  Her past medical history is significant for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  for which she is on long-term bronchodilator therapy  and hypertension  managed with an ACE inhibitor. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg five years ago  likely related to a hip surgery she underwent for a fracture and was on warfarin for six months following the DVT diagnosis. She is an ex-smoker with a 30 pack-year history  and quit smoking 10 years ago. She doesn't consume alcohol.   The patient's COPD and history of DVT puts her at a higher risk for pulmonary embolism. Currently  she presented with sudden onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  tachypnea  and had oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on room air  characteristic of acute pulmonary embolism. She also exhibited signs of low-grade fever and cough with no expectoration.   In the context of the demographic data available  our patient falls into the higher risk range for pulmonary embolism  as such  this condition is more common in people over 60 years of age  and it is reported more frequently in Caucasian population. Moreover  existing COPD can complicate the presentation and further increase morbidity and mortality. Lastly  the rural residence could have possibly contributed to a delay in her presentation due to the potential difficulty in accessing healthcare services.   In conclusion  given her past medical history  current signs and symptoms  and demographic profile  a high index of suspicion for the recurrence of pulmonary embolism is warranted in her case. Further investigations  including imaging and laboratory tests  are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and appropriately manage this patient.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,7,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Patient Presentation  Slide 1: Patient Demographics Patient is Mr. John Doe  a 53-year-old Caucasian male  married  with two children  and residing in Tulsa  Oklahoma. He is an office worker with a sedentary lifestyle and smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. His BMI is 29  indicating overweight.   Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a personal medical history notable for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. His father also had a history of deep vein thrombosis  translating to a predisposition to clotting disorders on the patient's part.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms On Thursday  Mr. Doe presented to the ED with sharp and pleuritic chest pain  developing suddenly  and difficulty breathing. He reported feeling lightheaded and he experienced a syncing episode at home that led to his coming to the hospital.   Slide 4: Physical Examination  Upon examination  Mr. Doe exhibited tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. BP: 160/95 mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  Temp: 98.6°F (37°C). Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  An EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no changes indicative of ischemia or infarction. A D-dimer test was positive. Significant findings on CT pulmonary angiography included the presence of thrombus in the right pulmonary artery  confirming a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Current Outcome and Treatment Mr. Doe was immediately started on anticoagulants. Lower extremity ultrasound ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Due to his history of hypertension and the risk of major bleeding  it was decided not to use thrombolytic therapy. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and further management of his acute pulmonary embolism. His smoking cessation and weight loss were strongly advised to reduce his risk factors.  Slide 7: Summary Acute pulmonary embolism can strike individuals of all demographics  yet studies show it's more common in middle-aged  sedentary individuals with underlying risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Early detection and aggressive management can significantly improve outcomes. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,8,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Woman with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile: Patient Information: Mrs. Linda Thompson  a 62-year-old African American woman.  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Thompson came to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  especially while breathing deeply  and a rapid heart rate that has been persistent for the past few hours.  Demographic Information: Mrs. Thompson is a retired school teacher  nonsmoker  and a light drinker. She lives with her husband in Charleston  South Carolina. She has a BMI of 28  which officially classifies her as overweight.  Medical History: Mrs. Thompson has a clear medical record except for two significant events. She had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) event five years ago following knee replacement surgery. It was managed effectively with anticoagulant therapy. She also went through menopause around the age of 51 and has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) since then.   Family History: No significant disease runs in the family except for Hypertension in her mother.   Current Medications: Mrs. Thompson has been taking hormone replacement therapy drugs (estrogen and progesterone)  and she was on Warfarin (anticoagulant therapy) after her DVT incident but discontinued as per the doctor's advice after an uneventful follow-up for six months.  Pertinent Findings: Upon examination  Mrs. Thompson presented with tachycardia (rapid heart rate)  tachypnea (rapid breathing)  and low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. Further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis  including a d-dimer test  and imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram.  In this case scenario  Mrs. Thompson’s history of DVT  her postmenopausal status with ongoing HRT  and being overweight are significant risk factors contributing to the possible development of acute pulmonary embolism.  Literature shows that pulmonary embolism is slightly more common in females  usually older (around the sixth decade)  and African American race has shown a slight increased risk. Among women  those on prolong hormone replace therapy have a higher risk  along with those having previous history of DVT and a sedentary lifestyle.  Note: This case presentation serves as an example and should not be used for diagnostic purposes. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,9,Patient Presentation:  Age: 60-year-old Gender: Female Race: African-American  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hypothyroidism which are well-controlled on medications  and has a history of smoking (quit 10 years ago). She had a total hip replacement 2 months prior and has been reasonably mobile since surgery  but her activity level decreased over the past week due to a worsening pain in her hip. She has no known allergies. The patient’s family history includes heart disease in the father who passed away at 75  and mother with breast cancer diagnosed late in life.  Current Presentation: The patient presents to the Emergency Department with acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain that started a few hours prior. She reports feeling lightheaded and says she almost fainted when the symptoms began. She describes the chest pain as a sharp  localized to the right side  and increasing with deep breaths. She denies any recent fever  cough or sputum production. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 98.5 F  heart rate 110/min  respiratory rate 24/min  blood pressure 145/90 mmHg  oxygen saturation 93% on room air.  The above presentation  including demographic information  and acute symptoms are typical for a patient with a pulmonary embolism (PE). Supportive features for the diagnosis include recent hip surgery predisposing to deep vein thrombosis and subsequent PE  acute onset of the symptoms  elevated heart rate  and hypoxia.  This presentation aligns with the typical demographic representation of PE found in literature. According to various studies  women are at a slightly lower risk for PE than men. The risk of PE increases with age and the disease is most common after the age of 60. The presence of co-morbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and recent surgery  as well as former smoking history  are all considered risk factors for PE. Similarly  African-Americans have a slightly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (including PE) compared to Caucasians. PE affects men and women of all races and ethnic groups. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,10,Title: A Case Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year old Caucasian male residing in an urban area in the United States. He is retired  moderately tobacco-exposed for over 30 years  and maintains a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of chronic hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type II diabetes mellitus  all of which are being managed with medication. He was hospitalized for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ten years ago. His family history reveals that his mother died of a myocardial infarction and his father had a stroke at the age of 70.  Presenting Complaint: He presented in the emergency room with a sudden onset of dyspnea  chest discomfort  and episodes of syncope. The symptoms started 24 hours before presentation. The patient describes the chest pain as ‘a heavy burden on the chest and difficulty in breathing’. He also mentioned having episodes of light-headedness and palpitations.  Objective Assessment: His vitals on presentation were BP 158/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110/min  respiratory rate 25/min  and Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. On physical examination  the patient appeared to be in respiratory distress. His BMI was on the higher side (28 kg/m2)  suggesting overweight category.  In relevant literature  patients of advancing age  those with previous DVT  and those with sedentary lifestyles are considered as high-risk factors for Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Moreover  male predominance is noted in cases of PE with underlying risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  consistent with our patient's profile.  The diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism was confirmed through the use of Diagnostic Imaging  specifically CT Pulmonary Angiography  which detected thrombus in the pulmonary arteries.   This patient's case highlights the importance of vigilance in patients with risk factors and prompt diagnosis and management to mitigate severe outcomes associated with Acute Pulmonary Embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,11,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Profile:   - Name: Mr. Douglas Johnson - Age: 63 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired Construction Engineer  - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Lifestyle: Sedentary  history of chronic cigarette smoking (averaging 1 pack a day) - Marital status: Widower - Location: Resides in rural Nebraska  Presentation/Chief Complaint:  Mr. Johnson presented with complaints of acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness. The pain is severe  sharp  and increases with deep breaths. He also reported intermittent pre-syncope episodes and mild productive cough for the past few weeks.  Past Medical History:  1. Chronic hypertensive 2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus 3. Periodic episodes of Deep Vein Thrombosis - on aspirin prophylaxis 4. Hyperlipidemia 5. History of cigarette smoking for the past 40 years 6. Sedentary lifestyle 7. Unintentional recent weight loss of around 10 kilos over the past 6 months  The above factors make Mr. Johnson a high-risk candidate for acute pulmonary embolism. His history of deep vein thrombosis  coupled with other risk factors including hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and sedentary lifestyle significantly increase his risk for thromboembolic events  as well as for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Review of Symptoms:  1. Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath  chest pain  lightheadedness 2. Respiratory: Cough with minimal production 3. Gastroenterology: No abdominal pain  bowel changes  or blood in the stool  however  reports unintentional weight loss 4. Neurology: Intermittent episodes of near syncope  Based on the demographic data and clinical presentation of Mr. Johnson  a diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism is highly suspected.  Early detection and appropriate therapeutic measures would be mandatory for Mr. Johnson based on his demographic and risk profile. The management would be focused on patient stabilization and measures aimed at preventing further serious thromboembolic events. Given his advanced age and comorbidities  a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology and pulmonology is recommended for optimal patient outcomes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,12,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation  Patient Information:  69-year-old Caucasian Male  retired truck driver  residing in the Midwestern United States.   Presenting Complaint:  Sudden onset shortness of breath associated with chest pain which worsens upon deep breathing. Reports episodes of recent leg swelling after returning from a long car ride.   Past Medical History:  Patient has a documented history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. He is on oral medication for both. He's a former smoker and has a previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 12 years ago.   Family History: The patient has a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father experienced a stroke at the age of 72  and his older brother has chronic heart disease.   Social History: The patient is a widower living alone  and no history of alcohol or illicit substances. He is retired and leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle. Reports a diet high in processed and fatty foods.  Physical Examination: Vital signs reveal a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 105 beats/min and a temperature of 98.6 F. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and tachycardia. Lower extremity examination shows unilateral swelling and tenderness of the right leg.  Investigation: The D-dimer level is found to be elevated. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia. CT pulmonary angiogram confirms the presence of pulmonary embolism.  Current Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Plan: The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on anticoagulation therapy. Consultation with Pulmonology and Hematology are requested for further management and to assess the need for thrombolytic therapy. The patient and family are also educated on the importance of strict medication compliance and the risks & signs of recurrent DVT and Pulmonary Embolism.   This case presentation reflects the literature which reports Pulmonary Embolism is more common in elderly populations and people with a sedentary lifestyle. High risk factors in this patient include his age  personal medical history of DVT  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Advanced age  history of DVT  and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes also contribute to high risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,13,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction: Today  we present a patient case from our internal medicine department involving acute pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism refers to a clot that blocks one or more arteries in the lungs. It's a severe condition that can cause permanent damage to the affected lung  low oxygen levels in your blood  and damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen.  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female from a suburban area  given the documented higher incidence of pulmonary embolism in the Caucasian demographic. She is a retired school teacher  a widow  and lives with her daughter's family.  Medical History: She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Lisinopril and Simvastatin  respectively. She does not have a history of any known lung disease  however  she is a former smoker and quit smoking 20 years ago. She has a BMI of 26  indicating she is slightly overweight. She recently underwent a total hip replacement surgery three weeks ago and has been less active than usual due to her recovery.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient reports progressive shortness of breath for the past 48 hours  especially on exertion. She has had no fever or cough  but she did experience a brief episode of faintness yesterday. Upon questioning  she also reported mild to moderate calf pain  which she attributed initially to her surgical recovery process.  Conclusion: Given her recent orthopedic surgery and the symptomatic presentation  she is at a high risk for deep vein thrombosis  and a subsequent pulmonary embolism. This case underscores the importance of risk stratification and vigilant monitoring post-surgery for any signs and symptoms indicative of a possible embolism. Consequently  immediate diagnostic protocols were initiated with a high index of suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism  potentially life-threatening  especially in the venous thromboembolism context.   Thus promptly identifying  diagnosing  and initiating treatment for pulmonary embolisms is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,14,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Caucasian Female with Prior Medical History  Patient Information: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has a 30-pack year smoking history but quit twenty years ago. She lives alone and leads a rather sedentary lifestyle due to mobility limitations related to advancing COPD and severe knee osteoarthritis.  Presenting Concerns: The patient was brought to the emergency room with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  tachypnea  and chest pain that she described as pleuritic in nature. She also reported feeling lightheaded and weak. Over the phone  her primary care doctor noted a rise in heart rate and recommended her immediate transportation to the hospital.   Clinical Examination and Test Findings: Upon admission  the patient was tachycardiac with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  blood pressure of 155/80 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Blood tests revealed an elevated D-Dimer level  prompting concern for PE.   She was promptly given a CT angiogram of the chest  which revealed evidence of a large pulmonary embolism. An ultrasound of the lower extremities showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left lower leg  likely the source of the embolus. Her arterial blood gases showed hypoxemia with a lower than normal partial pressure of oxygen.   Management and Prognosis:  Given the patient's history and presentation  she was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and later transitioned to warfarin for long-term management. She will also be assessed for the possible placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter given her high risk for recurrent DVT and PE. With treatment  we expect improved symptoms over the next few days. However  the patient will need consistent follow-up for monitoring anticoagulation efficacy and bleeding risks  particularly given her age and co-morbid conditions.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in COPD patients presenting with sudden unexplained dyspnea. The demographic and medical history of this patient match the typical risk profile for PE: older age  female  history of DVT  sedentary lifestyle  and multiple comorbidities.   (Note: This case is purely fictional)
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,15,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Presentation  Patient Information: Jane Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian female from an urban setting  presented to the emergency department in acute distress.   Medical History: She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on anticoagulation therapy. However  she was irregular with her medication citing recent financial issues. The patient also has a history of obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. She also suffered from hypertension that was controlled with medication. She denied any history of smoking or any family history of clots.   Presenting Symptoms: Jane exhibited shortness of breath  chest pain  and dizziness. These symptoms started approximately two hours prior to her presentation. Furthermore  she also complained about sudden onset palpitations which was not a regular occurrence for her.  Examination & Diagnostic Imaging: On physical examination  Jane was found to be anxious and diaphoretic. Her vitals were slightly unstable with elevated heart rate and shortness of breath. Initial diagnostic imaging involved an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed signs of right heart strain. A subsequent CT angiography confirmed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: Emergency care was directed towards stabilization of Ms. Doe's clinical condition - oxygen was administered for hypoxemia and intravenous fluids were started. Anti-coagulant therapy was immediately initiated.  Discussion: The demographic representation is largely consistent with studies which show the peak incidence of pulmonary embolism is around the age of 60  and it is more common in females. Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and history of DVT are all known risk factors. With such conditions  close adherence to anticoagulation therapy is crucial to preventing serious events like acute pulmonary embolism.   Ms. Jane Doe's case highlights the need for regular follow-ups and medication adherence  especially in patients with previous history of DVT or any other blood clot disorders.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,17,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged African American Female Patient  Introduction: I am presenting information on a 55-year-old African American woman presenting with acute pulmonary embolism. This case exemplifies how common risk factors—such as obesity  immobility  recent orthopedic surgery—can culminate into severe  clinical problems. Acute pulmonary embolism’s demographic predilection towards middle-aged African American women is well-documented in medical literature.  Patient Demographic Information: The patient is a 55-year-old African American female  currently residing in an urban city in Georgia. She is unmarried and lives alone. She was originally from South Carolina but moved to Georgia for her job. She is an advertising executive who typically leads a sedentary lifestyle due to work demands. The patient is above average weight  with a BMI of 32 qualifying her as obese according to World Health Organization's standards.   Past Medical History: •	Essential hypertension diagnosed at 40 years old  being managed with Lisinopril. •	Recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes  uncontrolled with diet and metformin. •	Obesity from young adulthood. •	No history of nicotine use or alcohol consumption  occasional social drinker  non-drug user. •	Family history is remarkable for cardiovascular disease: her father died of myocardial infarction at 59 years  and mother with chronic venous insufficiency. •	She had a right knee replacement surgery two weeks ago and has had reduced mobility since the procedure.  Presenting Symptoms: She presented in the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and light-headedness. Associated symptoms include a mild cough with no expectoration  hemoptysis  or fever.   Physical Examination Findings: •	Tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/minute •	Slightly elevated blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg •	Raised pulse rate of 98 beats/minute  •	Oxygen saturation hovered around 90% on room air •	Precordial examination revealed tachycardia without any murmurs  gallops  or rubs •	The lungs had decreased breath sounds in the lower right lung field •	She was anxious and mildly diaphoretic  In this case  her recent orthopedic surgery  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes all contributed to a high risk for venous thromboembolism leading ultimately to her presenting with acute pulmonary embolism symptoms. With this presentation  it is critical to provide immediate care  identify the source of the embolism  and begin anticoagulant treatment to prevent further health complications.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,18,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation   Patient Presentation: We are evaluating a 65-year-old Caucasian female patient who has presented with acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain specifically localized to the right side  increased palpitations  and mild hemoptysis.   Demographic Information: The patient  Mrs. White  is a retired teacher living with her husband in a suburban neighborhood about 15 minutes away from the hospital. She is moderately overweight with a BMI of 32  non-smoker  and drinks alcohol sparingly  with about a glass of wine every week. She sees her primary care physician regularly for her chronic diseases management.  Medical History: She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes managed with medication  compliance is good as per her primary care physician’s records. Additionally  she suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about three years back following a long flight after a holiday and was treated with anticoagulants at that time. She does not have a history of cancer or known genetic predispositions towards clotting disorders. On her mother's side of the family  however  there is cardiac disease history.   Presentation and Complications: Mrs. White’s presentation is consistent with acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  likely secondary to another DVT. The presence of chest pain and hemoptysis  and her past history of DVT further raise the index of suspicion. Pulmonary embolism might be life-threatening if not managed promptly and appropriately  and can lead to pulmonary hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in the long run. The patient already has a background of hypertension which may be exacerbated due to this.   This case demonstrates a typical acute PE presentation in the context of the patient’s history and current symptoms  appropriately reflecting the demographic and risk factors known to be associated with PE  such as age  obesity  and history of venous thromboembolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,19,"[Slide 1: Title] """"Case Presentation: Acute Pulicmonary Embolism""""  [Slide 2: Patient Introduction] Our patient is a 62-year-old African American female with a BMI of 28  presenting with acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath.  [Slide 3: Discussion on Racial disparity] Epidemiologic data shows that the incidence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) which includes Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is highest among African Americans. Moreover  females  particularly post-menopausal  are also at a higher risk.  [Slide 4: Past Medical History] In her past medical history  there is hypertension and deep vein thrombosis following a knee replacement surgery two years ago. She is a non-smoker but has a history of oral contraceptive use.  [Slide 5: Hypercoagulability and Risk Factors] Our patient is obese (BMI 28) which puts her at a higher risk of thrombus formation. Her past history of DVT after orthopedic surgery is another strong risk factor for reoccurrence of VTE. Furthermore  hypertension can act as a risk multiplier  and long-term usage of oral contraceptives is also a known risk factor for VTE in women.  [Slide 6: Symptomatology] The patient exhibits symptoms such as sudden onset of sharp chest pain  shortness of breath  and a sense of anxiety.   [Slide 7: Diagnosis] Confirmatory diagnostic procedures will be conducted such as a Pulmonary Angiogram or a CT Pulmonary Angiography. Additionally  a D-Dimer test  although nonspecific  can be used as a useful screening tool in this context.  [Slide 8: Treatment and Prognosis] The patient will be started on systemic or targeted anticoagulation therapy promptly after the presumptive diagnosis. Depending on her condition  thrombolytics or surgical embolectomy may be considered. The patient’s prognosis will essentially be determined by the severity of the embolism and the quickness of diagnosis and treatment initiation.        [Slide 9: Prevention and Follow-Up] The patient will be also educated on the preventive steps and lifestyle modifications including weight control  avoidance of prolonged mobility  and possibly changing to safer contraceptive methods. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment strategy as needed.   [Slide 10: Conclusion] Ultimately  the early recognition and prompt intervention in Acute Pulmonary Embolism significantly reduces morbidity and mortality rates.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,20,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Obese Female Patient  Good Afternoon   Today  I present a case of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism.   Demographics:  Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman from an urban setting. She retired five years ago and lives with her husband. According to numerous studies  the incidence of pulmonary embolism increases with age  making our patient a typical demographic for this condition.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. She has been struggling with a sedentary lifestyle  poor dietary habits  and consequent weight gain post retirement  despite warnings and advice from her primary care physician. She was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago  which was well-controlled on oral medication until recently. She was also diagnosed with hypertension around the same time.  In addition to obesity  diabetes  and hypertension  the patient also has a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  having suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ten years ago. She is no longer on anticoagulant therapy. According to the literature  obesity and a previous episode of DVT are significant risk factors for pulmonary embolism.  Current presentation:  The patient was brought to the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  tachypnea (rapid breathing)  and palpitations  consistent with the acute onset of pulmonary embolism symptoms. The medical team immediately initiated a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) that confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Next Steps:  Our primary focus for our patient is providing appropriate emergency care  which involves anticoagulation therapy and continuous monitoring of her vitals. We must also address the need for lifestyle modifications and management of her diabetes and hypertension.  To conclude  this case underlines the importance of understanding the typical demographic and risk factors for acute pulmonary embolism  including obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and a previous episode of DVT.   Thank you for your attention. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,21,Patient Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Demographic Information: Mrs. S is a 63-year-old Caucasian female who is a retired school teacher. She lives with her husband in a suburban community and they have three adult children. Mrs. S is a non-smoker and her alcohol consumption is limited to social events. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 32  classifying her as obese. Prior to retirement  she lived a fairly active lifestyle but within the past 2 years since retirement  she has become significantly less active.  Past Medical History: Mrs. S has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago. She was treated with anticoagulants for six months and was then taken off the medication. Mrs. S also suffers from Hypertension which is managed by medication (Lisinopril) and her blood pressure is usually well-controlled. She also has mild osteoarthritis but is not on regular pain medication for it. Mrs. S’s mother had a history of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism in her later life.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. S presents with sudden-onset shortness of breath  which has been worsening over the last 12-24 hours. She also reports experiencing chest pain  which intensifies with deep breathing. Additionally  she was noted to have a small amount of bloody sputum. These symptoms  in conjunction with her past medical history  are suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. Prompt evaluation via imaging like CT pulmonary angiogram and lab tests like D-dimer are required for accurate diagnosis and determining appropriate management strategy.   This presentation aligns with the literature which indicates that her demographic factors predispose her to have pulmonary embolism. The patient's age  history of DVT  a family history of thromboembolic diseases  obesity  hypertension  and her sedentary lifestyle are all risk factors associated with pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,22,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: The patient is a 63-year-old African American female with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29 kg/m²  living in an urban area. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  pulmonary embolism (PE) shows a racial disparity  affecting Blacks at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group.  Past Medical History:  This patient has an extensive past medical history  including type II diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation  both of which are well-managed with medication. This patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) approximately five years ago. Additionally  this patient is a former smoker and quit approximately 20 years ago. According to literature  there is a higher tendency for PE in people with a history of DVT  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain  dyspnea  lightheadedness  and a cough with specks of blood. Vital signs upon presentation include blood pressure at 150/90 mmHg  heart rate at 110 bpm (tachycardia)  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute (tachypnea)  and oxygen saturation at 92%. On physical examination  the patient seems anxious  has increased use of accessory respiratory muscles  and shows signs of right ventricular strain.  Assessment & Plan: Based on the patient's symptoms  her medical history  and physical examination findings  an acute pulmonary embolism seems likely. However  further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.  We plan to order a D-Dimer test which  if positive  will suggest the presence of a significant clot burden. A CT pulmonary angiography is also necessary to visualize any clots directly. Driver mutations associated with PE (e.g.  JAK2 V617F  CALR exon 9 mutations) may be tested for.  After confirming the diagnosis  the patient would be started on anticoagulation therapy as soon as possible to prevent further clots from developing. Long term management would include lifestyle modification and monitoring the patient's response to therapy.  In conclusion  this case exemplifies the importance of vigilance and appropriate suspicion of PE  especially in higher-risk populations  such as African American female patients having certain predisposing medical conditions. PE can present with a variety of symptoms  and rapid diagnosis and treatment can result in significantly improved patient outcomes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,23,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Case Presentation  Introduction:  Patient A is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with acute PE. Literature indicates that PE is more prevalent in the elderly population  with incidence rates increasing after the age of 60  more pronounced in males compared to females.  Demographics:  Patient A is a retired professor currently residing in the urban area of Chicago  Illinois. He lives alone and has two grown-up children who visit him regularly.  Symptoms:  He presents with acute symptoms of chest pain  difficulty breathing  and lightheadedness. He reported the abrupt onset of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath the night before his visit. In addition  he mentioned a minor fall in the bathroom earlier in the week but stated that it seemed inconsequential at the time. He also reported palpitations and an episode of fainting.  Past Medical History:  Patient A has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation  a medical condition confirmed five years ago for which he is on anticoagulants. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is under medication for both. Patient A has been a smoker for over 40 years  with a 30 pack-year history. He is not known to have any allergies but has been diagnosed with mild COPD  likely due to his prolonged history of smoking. His past surgical history involves a knee replacement surgery that occurred two years ago.   Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father died of an ischemic heart disease at an early age  and his eldest sibling has had a stroke. No known family history of malignancies or diagnosed thrombophilias.  Conclusion:  Thus  considering the patient’s symptoms  age  sex  history of atrial fibrillation while on anticoagulants  recent trauma  personal habits such as smoking  and a significant family history  he falls in a high-risk category for acute pulmonary embolism. Further clinical examination  laboratory investigations and imaging are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and undertake suitable treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,24,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Li Huang  a 68-year-old Asian female  has presented to the emergency department. She has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  which are all well-managed on medication. Mrs. Huang is a retired nurse  lives with her husband  and is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol use.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient reports having a sudden onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and palpitations noticed since this morning. She also mentions a recent long-haul flight about a week ago. On observation  she appears tachypneic and anxious. Her vitals on presentation include a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  pulse of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Huang's hypertension was diagnosed 15 years ago  with diabetes mellitus following a year later. Both conditions are largely controlled through diet  exercise  and medication. Her hyperlipidemia was discovered 5 years ago  adding simvastatin to her medication regimen  which also includes metformin for her diabetes and amlodipine for hypertension.  Relevant History:  Notably  Mrs. Huang has no previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or bleeding disorders. She denies any genetic predisposition to blood clots. She had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 10 years ago  with no peri- or post-operative complications. She recalls no episodes of uncontrolled bleeding or easy bruising.  Family History:  Her father passed away at the age of 75 due to a myocardial infarction  and her mother  who is 96 years old  has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She has one older sister with hypertension and one younger brother who is healthy. There is no reported family history of venous thromboembolism  heart disease in females before age 65  or males before age 55.  In Summary:  In light of the acute onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  tachypnea  and a recent long-haul flight  the patient is being evaluated for a high suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Mrs. Huang's advanced age  Asian ethnicity  and control over her chronic conditions align with the epidemiology of patients at risk for PE. Immediate diagnostic testing  including D-dimer assay and imaging  is underway for confirmation and treatment planning.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,26,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Woman  Slide 1: Introduction The presentation today discusses the case of a 63-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. Our patient mirrors the typical PE demographic: studies have highlighted the increasing likelihood of PE in individuals above 40 years  the higher prevalence amongst women  and the greater incidence in the Caucasian population.  Slide 2: Patient Identification Our patient is Mrs. J  a 63-year-old postmenopausal woman who resides in the urban environment of City X. She is married  recently retired as a school teacher  and is a non-smoker with no history of substance abuse.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Mrs. J presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and a rapid heart rate. These symptoms had started earlier that day and had gradually worsened over a few hours.   Slide 4: Past Medical History Mrs. J has a known history of obesity  with a BMI of 31  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. These are significant given the higher predisposition of these patients towards developing PE. She is on maintenance medications for these co-existing conditions.  Slide 5: Recent History  Notably  Mrs. J recently underwent a total hip replacement three weeks ago. Her limited mobility post-surgery and the relatively hypercoagulable state following major orthopedic surgery increase her risk for PE.   Slide 6: Family History There is a family history of venous thromboembolism  which heightens her predisposition for this condition. Her father had experienced a deep vein thrombosis at age 65.  Slide 7: Conclusion Mrs. J’s age  sex  postoperative state  personal health  and family history collectively contribute to her presentation of acute pulmonary embolism  underscoring the need for proactive management and preventive measures in similar patients. Further investigations and management are currently being decided upon by the attending healthcare team.

She is a non-smoker and works as an office manager  leading a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. She is overweight  with a BMI of 30.2  and has been living with hypertension for the past 12 years. The patient also divulges a family history of hypercoagulability disorders.  Past Medical History: The patient has a longstanding history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  effectively managed by oral antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. She has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and was on statin therapy. She also reports frequent episodes of lower extremity swelling. No known surgical history.  Presentation: The patient presents to the ER with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens on taking deep breaths  and dry cough. She reports being increasingly fatigued and experiencing rapid heart rate over the last 24 hours. On physical examination  she appears to be in acute respiratory distress; there is lower extremity edema  and her blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg. Her pulse oximetry shows reduced oxygen saturation levels.  The risk factors for this patient include advanced age  obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of thromboembolic disorders  making her a classic case for acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic imaging and blood tests have been ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.  The above presentation is representative of the demographic distribution of pulmonary embolism  which has been found to be slightly more common in females and African Americans. Risk factors include age (particularly those over the age of 60)  obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  and a history of thromboembolic disorders.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,28,Slide 1: Title Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Case Presentation  Slide 2: Introduction In this presentation  we discuss the case of a patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  a sudden blockage in the pulmonary arteries  which has a higher incidence in adults over 60 years old  females  and those with certain predisposing factors such as recent surgery or pregnancy.  Slide 3: Patient Demographics The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  representing the demographic majority of reported APE cases. She is a current smoker and lives alone. She has a BMI of 30  categorizing her as obese - another potential risk factor.  Slide 4: Medical History She has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. She recently underwent a total hip arthroplasty 10 days ago.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms The patient presented to the ER with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. She also reported feeling light-headed. Her immediate relatives were contacted by ER staff  who reported her becoming increasingly dyspneic in the past week.  Slide 6: Clinical Examination On examination  she had tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24/min  tachycardia of 110 bpm  low oxygen saturation at 88% on room air  and elevated BP at 160/90 mm Hg. Her physical examination was significant for decreased breath sounds on the right side.  Slide 7: Diagnostic Findings Her D-dimer was elevated. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery. ECG showed signs consistent with right heart strain.  Slide 8: Discussion This combination of recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  pre-existing comorbidities  and acute onset of symptoms led to a high clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism  which was subsequently confirmed via imaging.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining clinical suspicion for APE in patients with risk factors  as quick diagnosis and treatment can drastically improve prognosis. Future strategies include risk stratification and prophylaxis administration in high-risk individuals to minimize incidence of APE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,29,[Slide 1]  Title: Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  [Slide 2]  Title: Demographic Information and Medical History  Patient’s Profile:  - Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian female. - She is a retired school teacher with moderate economic status. - She is nonsmoker and non-alcoholic. - She currently resides in a mid-size city in the Midwestern United States.  [Slide 3]   Title: Medical History   - Patient X has a history of high blood pressure  controlled well by medication.  - She is obese with a BMI of 31.  -  She has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and manages it with regular exercise  dietary changes  and oral medication. - Patient also has a history of varicose veins.  [Slide 4]  Title: Onset of Symptoms  - Patient X presented with sudden onset of symptoms  which include shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breathing. - She has also been experiencing an unexplained cough  and has noticed light-headedness and rapid heart beat. - Upon observation  the patient also has decreased oxygen saturation and distended neck veins.  [Slide 5]   Title: Diagnosis and Hospital Admission  - Based on the symptoms presented  Patient X was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  - The condition was confirmed with CT pulmonary angiography scan that demonstrated the presence of blood clots in the lungs. - She was immediately admitted to the hospital’s ICU for further treatment and management.   [Slide 6]  Title: Discussion & Conclusion  - Although pulmonary embolism (PE) can affect individuals regardless of age  sex  or race  statistically certain factors like older age  Caucasian race  female gender  obesity  hypertension  presence of varicose veins  and diabetes have been linked with a higher risk of PE. - In the case of Patient X  her demographic information and medical history demonstrate many of these risk factors. - Her case exemplifies the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent further complications.   Notes: The representation of a 65-year-old Caucasian female with obesity  hypertension  and diabetes as a patient with acute pulmonary embolism is accurate based on the available scientific literature. Women  especially elderly and overweight  are at elevated risk for acute pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  the presence of varicose veins can predispose an individual to developing blood clots  and lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes can exacerbate the condition. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,30,Title: A Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient's Background Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female  Margaret. She is a retired schoolteacher and resides in the Midwest with her husband. She has a 30 pack-year history of smoking.  Past Medical History: Margaret has a history of sedentary lifestyle and is also obese with a BMI of 32. She also has a significant history of recurring DVT  which has been on anticoagulation therapy  but she has had difficulty maintaining consistent use due to financial constraints and complicated dosing schedule. She is also hypertensive and has type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are major risk factors for thrombotic events. There is no known genetic clotting disorder. She does not consume alcohol or use recreational drugs.   Recent History: About a week ago  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery for her severe osteoarthritis. Within the past 48 hours  she started experiencing shortness of breath  a sharp pain in her chest which intensifies with deep breaths  feeling lightheaded  and having rapid heartbeats.   As literature suggests  Margaret embodies some of the most significant risk factors for Pulmonary Embolism (PE). She is female  over 60  has a history of smoking  obesity  and DVT  underwent recent surgery  and has other chronic diseases like hypertension and DM. Her clinical presentation fits the common signs and symptoms of PE.   A diagnosis of PE is highly suspected given her clinical presentation and risk factor profile. Subsequently  she will need urgent medical management following thorough radiological and laboratory investigations for diagnostic confirmation. Her case also underscores the importance of medical compliance  enhanced recovery after surgery protocols  and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in high-risk patients  like herself  to mitigate the risk of PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,31,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism – A Case Presentation  Introduction:  Mr. David Wilson  a 63-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department with symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. It is crucial to note that African Americans have been identified in several studies as having higher prevalence rates of venous thromboembolic diseases  including pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Wilson has been experiencing shortness of breath  sudden onset chest pain  light-headedness  and fainting spells for the last couple of hours. He reports that the chest discomfort worsens with deep breaths. Additionally  he also complains of coughing up blood-tinged sputum.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson had been a heavy smoker for over 35 years before he quit 5 years ago. He is combating a recently diagnosed hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also has moderate obesity with a BMI of 31 kg/m2. He has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which was treated about a year ago. Unfortunately  he is not compliant with his prescribed anticoagulant regimen. He emphasizes that he leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his retired status  hence reducing his physical activity significantly.  Risk Factors:  Mr. Wilson exhibits many risk factors for pulmonary embolism  including advanced age  African American race  history of DVT  untreated type 2 diabetes  hypertension  former tobacco use  and sedentary lifestyle.  Conclusion:  Mr. Wilson’s clinical presentation and past medical history strongly suggest the possibility of an acute pulmonary embolism. His demographic sets  presence of multiple comorbidities and risk factors  make the consideration even more crucial. Urgent diagnostic tests including D-Dimer  arterial blood gas analysis  serum troponin  and chest imaging modalities like CTPA or V/Q scan would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and enable immediate therapeutic intervention.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,32,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction: Our patient is a 70-year-old African American female presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). According to epidemiological data  pulmonary embolism affects a wide demographic  however  incidence rates are moderately higher amongst individuals over the age of 60 and slightly more prevalent amongst African Americans.  Presenting Complaint: She reports sudden-onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing  and a mild cough. She has also noted unexplained episodes of light-headedness and fatigue over the past week.   Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both controlled with medication. According to the literature  pre-existing cardiovascular or metabolic disorders can increase the likelihood of thrombosis. She does not smoke but reports being sedentary most of the time due to arthritis. Sedentariness is recognized to increase risk for thrombotic events.  In addition  the patient had a hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. Orthopedic surgeries  especially hip and knee replacements  are known predisposing factors related to the risk of developing a thrombus due to prolonged immobilization.  Family History: Her family history is significant for venous thromboembolism (her father had a deep vein thrombosis at age 68)  indicating a possible genetic predisposition to clotting disorders. Genetic disposition and familial occurrence of thrombotic events are recognized as risk factors for developing an acute pulmonary embolism.  Summary: In summary  this 70-year-old African American female presents with symptoms representative of an acute pulmonary embolism  alarming considering her increased risk due to age  ethnicity  medical history  and recent surgery. Further investigations are needed to confirm this presumptive diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,33,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Gerald Sanders  a 67-year-old African-American male  has presented to our Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain and palpitations that started approximately 3 hours ago. The pain is sharp  constant and worsens on deep inspiration. He rates it 7/10 in intensity. He further reports feeling dizzy  with an episode of fainting shortly before arrival.   Considering demographic representation as per the literature  it is noted that African-American males over the age of 60 are at an increased risk for developing Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) due to the higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and obesity.   In terms of past medical history  Mr. Sanders has a diagnosis of hypertension which he manages with Lisinopril  and he has a BMI classified in the obese range. He had a right knee replacement surgery six weeks ago and has been less mobile since his procedure. There is also a significant family history of venous thromboembolic events; his mother had recurrent deep vein thrombosis. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years earlier  and drinks alcohol socially. He denies any recreational or illicit drug usage.   In conclusion  considering Mr. Sanders' age  race  immobility following recent surgery  personal medical history  and family history  he falls into a high-risk group for Acute Pulmonary Embolism. His sudden onset of symptoms such as shortness of breath  chest pain  and syncope are characteristic of APE. Further investigations  including D-dimer test and imaging studies  are required urgently to confirm the diagnosis and to institute appropriate treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,34,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Female  Patient Information: Our presenting patient is Ms. G.  a 64-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 170 pounds  indicating a BMI of 27.41 which falls in the overweight category.  Demographics: According to the literature  acute pulmonary embolisms (APE) is slightly more common in females than in males  and the risk of occurrence increases with age. The population group with the highest incidence is Caucasians  followed by African Americans.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. G. came to our emergency department with chief complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and unusual fatigue which started a few hours prior to admission.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for about five years post-menopause  which  according to literature  could be significant as HRT can increase the risk of blood clots leading to APE.   She also has an established history of hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with lifestyle modifications and anti-hypertensive medications She was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  added as a risk factor for Pulmonary Embolism (PE).  Family History: The patient's mother had a history of DVT and died of massive PE at the age of 70  which inches ahead the risk for this patient.  Lifestyle: Ms. G. never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally. She leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle since her retirement five years ago.  Summary: In summary  Ms. G. is an overweight  post-menopausal  hypertensive  64-year-old Caucasian female patient  with a personal history of DVT and HRT  and a family history of PE. She is presenting with classic signs consistent with acute PE. These factors press upon a high suspicion of acute PE  which further investigations will be required to confirm this diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,35,Title: Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Introduction: Good day  esteemed colleagues. Today  I want to present to you a case of a patient who was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism.   Patient Presentation: The patient  Mr. John Peterson  is a 60-year-old Caucasian male from rural Wisconsin. He works as a truck driver  a job that has him sitting for long hours daily. He used to be a 30-pack-year smoker but has been tobacco-free for about seven years now but consumes alcohol socially. He is married and has two children. His wife reports his BMI as 29  confirming that he falls into the overweight category. About two years ago  Mr. Peterson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and currently takes metformin.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Peterson presented at the emergency department complaining of acute onset chest discomfort  shortness of breath  and anxiety. He was notably tachycardic and diaphoretic on examination. His family history is significant for pulmonary embolism (his father) and deep vein thrombosis (his younger brother).  Investigations: On the basis of these signs and symptoms  we performed an EKG that showed tachycardia and a slight S1Q3T3 pattern  suggestive of right heart strain. A D-dimer test was immediately ordered which returned significantly high levels. Considering his risk factors and his clinical presentation  a CT pulmonary angiogram was carried out and our suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism turned out to be accurate.  Risk Factors: Mr. Peterson's risk factors that stand out are his sedentary job  past tobacco use  his overweight status  and his positive family history of thromboembolic disorders. Given his demographic and lifestyle  he fits into what literature describes as a high-risk population for pulmonary embolism.   In Conclusion: Acute pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal condition if not recognized and treated promptly. It is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion in any patient presenting with unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  or systemic hypotension  particularly when risk factors like prolonged immobility  a history of smoking  obesity  or a positive family history exist. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for promptly considering this diagnosis in an at-risk population. Mr. Peterson is currently undergoing anticoagulation therapy and exhibiting encouraging signs of recovery.   Thank you  and I am open to any questions you may have.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,36,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation   Patient Presentation: Mrs. Maria Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic woman  presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that began earlier today. She describes the pain as sharp  localized to the central chest area  and is exacerbated by deep inhalation. She also reports feeling light-headed and has been sweating more than usual.  Demographics:  Our patient is a retired teacher who resides in an urban area with her husband. She has two adult children. She does not smoke but has a history of occasional alcohol consumption. Maria lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle and is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.   Medical History:  The patient has a previous medical history of hypertension  which has been managed by an anti-hypertensive medication (Lisinopril) for the past ten years. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with Metformin  and was treated for breast cancer four years ago with lumpectomy and radiation  followed by Tamoxifen. She has not had any significant surgical interventions other than her lumpectomy.   Recently  Maria took a long-haul flight to visit her daughter  which lasted approximately 8 hours. She admits to remaining seated for most of the journey. Upon returning home  she noticed a mild swelling in her right calf  which she attributed to the flight and did not seek medical help.  There is a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  her mother had a DVT  and a maternal aunt had a pulmonary embolism. In view of her symptoms  recent long-haul travel  and family history of venous thromboembolism  acute pulmonary embolism is a primary concern.  Summary: In conclusion  the current presentation and her past medical history put this patient at high risk for acute pulmonary embolism. Risk factors include recent long-haul flight  obesity  recent cancer treatment  and family history of DVT and PE. As this represents a life-threatening emergency  immediate evaluation  and intervention are crucial.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,38,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Female Patient   1. Introduction: Presenting a case report today is about a 70-year-old Caucasian woman with an acute pulmonary embolism.  2. Patient’s Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who resides in an urban area. She lives in a nuclear family household with her retired husband and their pet cat. She is a native English speaker  holds a bachelor's degree  and used to work as a school teacher before retirement. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.   3. Past medical history:  Her medical history reveals her as a diagnosed case of type II diabetes and stage 1 hypertension for the past ten years. She had undergone a total hysterectomy twenty years ago  secondary to uterine fibroids. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; her father suffered a myocardial infarction at an early age  and her sister is a survivor of stroke.  4. Presenting issue: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset breathlessness  chest pain  and light-headedness. On questioning  the woman reported she had recently travelled on a long-distance flight  which is one of the risk factors for pulmonary embolism.   5. Assessment: Upon examination  the patient was in obvious respiratory distress with hypoxia and elevated heart rate. A D-dimer test was performed  followed by a CT pulmonary angiography on the basis of her clinical symptoms and signs  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  6. Conclusion: Considering the patient’s age  her past medical history including hypertension  diabetes  and long travel  as well as presenting symptoms  the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made. This case emphasizes that awareness and early detection of acute pulmonary embolism can be life-saving  particularly in elderly populations with multiple comorbidities.  References indicate that the prevalence of pulmonary embolism is higher among older adults (65 or older)  Caucasians  and women. Furthermore  individuals with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension are at an increased risk. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,39,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Patient Identity: Ms. Helen  a 67-year-old Caucasian female.  Residence: Lives alone in an urban setting in Michigan.  Occupation: Retired schoolteacher.  Slide 3: History   Past Medical History: Ms. Helen has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension  both under control with medication.   Recent History: She underwent a right hip replacement surgery three weeks ago. Post-surgery  she was immobilized for a prolonged period.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms    Upon admission  Ms. Helen presented with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. She also mentioned experiencing a cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum.  Slide 5: Risk Factors  Risk factors in this case include age  surgery (particularly hip or knee replacement)  immobility  history of COPD  and hypertension.   Slide 6: Typical Presentation  Given her recent history of surgery  immobility state  presenting symptoms  it was highly suspected that she might be suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Slide 7: Conclusion  The typical demographic pattern of a patient presenting with PE consists of older adults  with a high prevalence in women aged above 60. This presentation of an elderly female patient post-surgery  with underlying COPD and hypertension  falls well within the literature-defined demographic representation of acute PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,40,Title: A Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Presentation: The patient is a robust  pleasant 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Brown. He is a retiree  non-smoker  whose alcohol use is characterized as social and infrequent. Mr. Brown had been living independently in a suburban setup before presentation.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department experiencing sharp chest pain  shortness of breath that has progressively worsened  and a sudden onset of cough with bloody sputum for the last 12 hours. He states that the pain is aggravated on deep inspiration.  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown's medical history reveals controlled hypertension for the past ten years. He had an open prostate surgery a month ago. He has no known allergies. Family history includes one brother with coronary artery disease.    Review of Systems:  The review of systems is significant for chest pain  cough  breathlessness  and bloody sputum. All other systems were reviewed and were negative.  Lab Results and Findings: Clinically  he was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Other vital signs include blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a temperature of 37.4°C. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia while chest x-ray was unremarkable.  Conclusion:  The severity and sudden onset of Mr. Brown's symptoms  his recent surgery  and the associated risk factors  all point towards a presumptive diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism. This diagnosis was confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography. He is currently on anticoagulation therapy and is in stable condition awaiting hospital admission.  The demographic data and presentation described here align with literature which finds that individuals over 60  particularly those with prior surgical interventions  hypertension  and males  face a higher risk of acute pulmonary embolism. Caucasians also tend to have a slightly higher prevalence rate than other racial groups. It is important to note that pulmonary embolism can affect any demographic  so thorough assessment and suspicion should always be maintained when presented with similar symptoms. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,41,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female Patient with Prior History of DVT  Good day everyone   I am here to present a case of an acute pulmonary embolism in a 52-year-old Caucasian female patient. Mrs. Smith is a retired school teacher from Omaha  Nebraska. She is married with two grown children and currently helps caring for her three grandchildren part-time. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 29.5 which categorizes her as overweight.   Regarding her past medical history  she was diagnosed with left leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 8 years ago  for which she received treatment. However  it appears Mrs. Smith has not been consistently implementing preventive measures associated with DVT.  Moreover  she has a history of occasional smoking and a semi-sedentary lifestyle. She has been hypertensive for ten years and she also has a history of oral contraceptive use in the past.   For this presentation  Mrs. Smith came to the emergency department with acute onset of chest discomfort and shortness of breath which started suddenly while she was doing housework. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  temperature 98.6°F  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation just 89% on room air  and heart rate 105 beats per minute.   Considering her symptomatic presentation and patient history  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. Further diagnostic tests were recommended to confirm this diagnosis and provide appropriate timely medical intervention.   This case is noteworthy because pulmonary embolism is more common among Caucasian individuals  representing about 70% of the cases. Furthermore  according to the literature  obesity is a known risk factor for venous thromboembolism  which encompasses DVT and pulmonary embolism. Females are generally at elevated risk due to potential pregnancy  childbirth  and use of oral contraceptives.   In this case  Mrs. Smith's semi-sedentary lifestyle  occasional smoking  history of hypertension and DVT  all conjoin to increase her propensity to develop an acute pulmonary embolism.  Thank you for your attention  I'd be more than happy to answer any queries now.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,42,"Title: Presentation of a Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction:  We present a case of a 60-year-old Caucasian female patient with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is a retired office worker  non-smoker  with a BMI of 28. She has a past medical history which includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both under control with medication and a diet regimen.  Presentation:  The patient presented in the emergency department with sudden onset slurred speech  acute shortness of breath and chest discomfort. She described her chest pain as """"sharp"""" and “worsening on deep inspiration ” rated at 8/10. The shortness of breath was not related to her physical activity level and was accompanied by some light-headedness and a sense of anxiety. She denied cough  hemoptysis  orthopnea or leg swelling.  Past Medical History:  Her medical history was significant for hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago and well controlled with lisinopril. She was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 6 years ago and is currently managed by Metformin. She has no known history of lung diseases  coronary artery disease  or dyslipidemia. The patient had a total knee replacement 3 weeks ago  after which her mobility had been somewhat limited.   Conclusion:  The combination of her symptoms  along with her recent low mobility from surgery  led us to suspect the possibility of acute pulmonary embolism. This is further supported by her demographic representation in PE literature  as Caucasian women around 60 years of age are commonly affected. Furthermore  her BMI of 28 further increases her risk. Further diagnostics were required for confirmation and to guide the appropriate treatment and management plan."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,43,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male from the United States presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Mr. Smith is a retired school teacher and lives with his wife. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit two years ago. He does not consume alcohol and has an inactive lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant medical history featuring obesity  hypertension  dyslipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a routine hip replacement surgery two weeks ago and has been largely inactive post-surgery. Unfortunately  he does not engage in frequent post-surgical physiotherapy due to severe discomfort and lack of motivation.  Symptoms: He has been experiencing shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  and occasional hemoptysis  or coughing up blood  for the last 24 hours. He also reports feelings of anxiety and lightheadedness.   Demographics and Representation: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is found to be more prevalent among the elderly  with reported median ages at presentation ranging from 60 to 72 years  which parallels Mr. Smith's demographic. Similarly  prior surgical procedures and reduced mobility are often associated with increased risk of PE. Moreover  the presence of chronic diseases like COPD  obesity  and hypertension in Mr. Smith's history further enhances his risk for PE.  References: Carbonell  N.  Blasco  M.  Vidal  C.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,44,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Profile:   Ms. Johanna  a 68-year-old African American female with a BMI of 28  has presented today with complaints of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. Ms. Johanna is a retired school teacher from Chicago  Illinois.   Past medical history:  Ms. Johanna has a known history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and has suffered from a transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago. She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg a year ago  for which she completed the course of prescribed anticoagulants therapy. She also indicates a family history of coagulopathies. She is also a former smoker  having quit approximately 8 years ago  and reports occasional alcohol use.   Current medications include metformin  aspirin  and lisinopril.  Literature Highlights:  According to recent studies and publications  African American individuals have a higher incidence rate of acute pulmonary embolism as compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Essential contributing factors include age and comorbidity such as hypertension  diabetes  and obesity which aligns with Ms. Johanna’s profile. Moreover  a history of DVT  as in Ms. Johanna’s case  significantly increases the risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.   Furthermore  the US demographic data suggests women between the ages of 60-79 are highly susceptible to acute pulmonary embolism. Therefore  Ms. Johanna falls within this bracket. Additionally  embolic events are particularly common among those with a history of smoking  potentially due to the prothrombotic state induced by nicotine.  Impressions:  Given her presenting symptoms and past medical history  there is a significant concern that Ms. Johanna is suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism. However  proper diagnostic testing including ECG  chest CT scan  D-Dimer test  and ultrasound of the legs will be needed to confirm this preliminary diagnosis. Afterwards  a suitable treatment plan including therapeutic anticoagulation or thrombolysis will be considered based on the risk stratification and her clinical stability.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,45,Title: An Acute Presentation of Pulmonary Embolism   Slide 1: Introduction  Patient: Mrs. JV  a 70-year-old Caucasian female  Residence: Lives alone in an urban environment  formerly employed as a secretary  now retired.   Slide 2: Presenting Problems  Mrs. JV presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath  a races heart rate  and chest discomfort. She is anxious and fearful due to breathing difficulties.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. JV is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago. She has a documented history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia which are both managed with medication. Mrs. JV also suffers from obesity with a BMI of 32. She had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about ten years ago and a recent surgery (right total knee replacement) about two weeks ago.  Slide 4: Current Medication  Mrs. JV is currently on antihypertensives  cholesterol-lowering agents  and post-surgery prophylactic anticoagulants.   Slide 5: Physical Examination  On examination  Mrs. JV appears anxious and is clammy to touch. Respiratory rate is increased at 24 breaths per minute; Oxygen saturation is at 89% in room air  and heart rate is elevated at 110 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal ranges. On auscultation  lungs reveal decreased breath sounds on the right side.   Slide 6: Preliminary Diagnosis  Given her recent orthopedic surgery  history of DVT  symptomatology  and physical exam findings  there is a high index of suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 7: Plan  Immediate action involves stabilizing the patient  ensuring adequate oxygenation  and initiating appropriate anticoagulant therapy. Further investigations  like computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and blood tests will aid to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity. Consultation with a pulmonologist is crucial for targeted treatment and management.   Slide 8: Summary  Recognition and prompt action in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism is highly critical due to the potential life-threatening nature of this condition. Mrs. JV’s demographics  medical history  and presenting symptoms raise a high clinical suspicion highlighting the importance of a comprehensive approach to assessment and treatment. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,46,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female Patient with History of Coagulation Disorders   Patient: Ms. Samantha Green Age: 45 years Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Desk job - Accountant  Residence: Suburban area   Past Medical History:  1. Primary Coagulation Disorder: Factor V Leiden since age 25.  2. Overweight with a BMI of 29.  3. Ex-smoker – quit 10 years ago. 4. Past history of oral contraceptive use for about 10 years  stopped 5 years ago. 5. No history of any surgical procedures or chronic illnesses such as hypertension  diabetes or heart diseases. 6. Family history of coagulation disorders and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).  Clinical Presentation: Ms. Samantha Green presents to the hospital with sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp chest pain worsening with deep breaths  light-headedness  rapid heart rate  and a mild cough with slight blood-streaked sputum. These symptoms were preceded by pain  redness  swelling and increased warmth in the right calf that has been worsening over the last two days.   Vital Signs at Presentation:  1. Blood Pressure: 130/90 mmHg 2. Pulse: 110 bpm (tachycardia) 3. Respiratory Rate: 22/minute (tachypnea) 4. Oxygen saturation: 92%  Discussion: The patient's current symptoms and past medical history suggest a likely diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  which is supported by her risk factors: primarily the coagulation disorder of Factor V Leiden  her being overweight and her former smoking habit. It's also noteworthy  her symptom of lower limb discomfort may indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  the most common source for a PE. In PE  the mortality is high if left untreated  hence  urgent investigations like D-Dimer  chest CT angiography  echocardiography and possibly venous Doppler ultrasound for the leg are of essence in this case. Timely treatment with anticoagulants will help decrease the mortality rate. After the acute phase  a complete thrombophillia screening considering her medical and family history is indicated to guide long term management.   This case represents the typical demographic for Acute PE  being more common in Caucasians as per multiple studies  with a median age of diagnosis being 60  however her personal risk factors have influenced an early presentation. Women are at risk especially with histories of oral contraceptive use and coagulation disorders.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,47,Title: Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Introduction: In today's discussion  we present the case of an acute pulmonary embolism in a 67-year-old female patient.   Patient’s Information: The patient is a 67-year-old  post-menopausal Caucasian woman  known as Mrs. Susan Davis. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband of 40 years in their home. She has a history of smoking but quit 15 years ago  around the same time she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been compliant with her medications for COPD  including inhaled bronchodilators. She has also been treated for stage I hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 5 years ago  which is controlled with oral hypoglycemics.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Davis presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain  which she described as sharp and worsened on deep inspiration. She also reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing palpitations.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  Mrs. Davis was found to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute  tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats/minute  and hypotensive with BP 100/70 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation on room air was 89%. On auscultation  her breath sounds were found to be diminished in the right lower lung field.   Summary: This case demonstrates a typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism in a high-risk patient. Mrs. Davis' age  history of smoking  COPD  hypertension  and diabetes are significant risk factors for the development of a pulmonary embolism. Her symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  light-headedness  and palpitations are highly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and suitable treatment initiated thereafter.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,48,Patient Presentation:  We have a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. Williams  presenting with acute shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. He reports an onset of symptoms within the past 24 hours. He also mentioned that he recently took a 12-hour non-stop flight a week ago. Notably  our patient has not experienced similar symptoms in the past.   Past Medical History:  Looking into his past medical history  the patient has a history of hypertension  managed by Lisinopril 10 mg once daily. He underwent a total hip replacement surgery 6 months ago and completed his course of postoperative anticoagulant prophylaxis. He has been a nonsmoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. His family history is significant with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his mother with a stroke at the age of 72.  Demographic Insights:  According to available literature  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) typically presents more in the elderly with a mean age of 60 years  with a slightly higher incidence in males. Major risk factors include recent surgery  prolonged immobility  malignancy  and prior venous thromboembolism  which aligns with Mr. Williams' recent surgery  long haul flight  and age. His hypertension also puts him at a higher risk. The patient belongs to the Caucasian race  where according to some studies  the incidence of PE may be higher when compared to other races.  Thus  considering the triad of deep vein thrombosis - immobility  endothelial injury  and hypercoagulability  a diagnosis of suspected acute pulmonary embolism is made  which should be confirmed by appropriate diagnostic imaging. Immediate management options should be considered to prevent further complications.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,49,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Introduction: Our patient  Mrs. K  is a 70-year-old African-American female. She is a retired primary school teacher who has a past medical history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) secondary to a hip replacement surgery which she underwent five years ago. At the time  she was treated with anticoagulants for six months. It is important to note that African Americans are epidemiologically known to be more affected by hypertension and thus are at greater risk of pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. K reported sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  shortness of breath and blood in sputum (hemoptysis) that started 4 hours before her arrival at the Emergency Department. She also complained of unusually severe fatigue over the past week. Considering her medical history  these symptoms raise the initial suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Past Medical History: Apart from hypertension  COPD  and previous DVT  Mrs. K is obese with a BMI of 31  and she has never smoked. She has been consistently taking her prescribed blood pressure medications and medications for COPD.   Recent History: Upon questioning  Mrs. K reported that she had been on a long train journey (about 12 hours) visiting her daughter just two days ago. Prolonged immobility in such settings is a known risk factor for DVT and consequent PE.  In Conclusion: Early diagnosis and management of Mrs. K's condition is critical to reduce the risk of mortality associated with acute PE. Given her clinical presentation and past medical history  she is high-risk and should be worked up promptly and appropriately for PE.   Important considerations for her management plan will include novel oral anticoagulants and the evaluation of any remaining DVT in her lower extremity veins. Long term  lifestyle modifications addressing weight loss will also need to be discussed to help reduce her future PE risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,50,Patient Presentation – Acute Pulmonary Embolism  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female presenting with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  and a cough producing bloody sputum  symptoms suggesting an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). She reports the symptoms started a few hours ago.  She has a history of prolonged immobility due to recent hip replacement surgery 2 weeks ago. Moreover  the patient reports a family history of blood clotting disorders  specifically referencing an older sister who was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis. Her personal medical history also reveals chronic hypertension  for which she has been taking antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years.  The patient has a 20-year history of smoking but quit smoking 5 years ago. She reports one pack per day for those 20 years for an approximate 20-pack year smoking history. Currently  she doesn't drink or use illicit drugs.  She works as a schoolteacher  lives with her husband  and reports a sedentary lifestyle due to her job nature. She denies recent travel or prolonged periods of sitting.  Research suggests that risk factors for pulmonary embolism include recent surgery  family history of blood clots  personal history of hypertension  and being a current or former smoker  all of which are applicable to this patient. APE typically affects those over 60  and Caucasians carry a higher risk than other races.  Given these factors  Acute Pulmonary Embolism seems a likely diagnosis  which is a treatable condition if detected timely. Further diagnostic testing  including D-dimer  CT pulmonary angiogram  or V/Q scan  will be required to confirm. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,51,Title: Clinical Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Male Patient  Patient Profile: The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Allen. He is a lawyer by profession and leads a somewhat sedentary lifestyle. He does not smoke but consumes alcohol only during social occasions. He is married  has two children  and lives in the city's affluent suburbs. The patient is overweight  with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.  Past Medical History: Mr. Allen has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. He has also had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago following a knee surgery. He was treated with anticoagulant therapy for six months post that incidence. There is no family history of any inherited thrombophilias or cancers.  Current Presentation: Mr. Allen presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain that began earlier in the day. He reported no recent travel or prolonged immobility  no recent surgeries  and is not on any regular medication  apart from his antihypertensive and hypoglycemic agents. The symptoms were not associated with fever  cough  or expectoration.  Initial physical examination revealed tachypnea  tachycardia  and decreased oxygen saturation on room air. Chest auscultation was clear  and there was no leg swelling or signs suggestive of DVT.  Such a clinical presentation in a patient with known risk factors is suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. Diagnostic tests including D-dimer  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)  and possible echocardiogram will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of his condition.  In terms of demographic representation  it is accurate to present a patient with these characteristics  as pulmonary embolism is most commonly seen in adults over the age of 60  more so in those with pre-existing risk factors such as obesity  cardiovascular diseases  a history of DVT or immobilization  and in males. Regardless of age  the incidence is quite similar across racial and ethnic groups  but severity and outcome can vary. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,52,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Profile: Mrs. Lucy Stevens  a 70-year-old Caucasian female  presents with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE). She resides in a suburban neighborhood in California and is a former teacher. Regarding her habits  she has a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit about five years ago. She is a widow and lives alone. She has a daughter who visits her weekly to help her with daily tasks and chores.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Stevens is previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease and hypertension. She underwent a total knee replacement for osteoarthritis six months ago  which increased her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common source of PE. She has a history of occasional atrial fibrillation (AF) controlled with prescribed medication (beta-blockers). She reports adherence to her antihypertensive medication and denies any recent change.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Stevens presented with shortness of breath which started suddenly about two days ago and has progressively worsened. Accompanying symptoms include light-headedness  intermittent chest pain  and low-grade fever. She states that she finds it harder to walk and move around because of breathlessness.   PE Literature Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations  with an incidence of approximately 70 per 100 000 person-years. As per literature  PE is more common in older individuals  and the risk significantly increased after the age of 60 years. It is widely recognized to have no gender predilection. Various factors contribute to the risk of PE including previous major surgery  history of DVT  malignancy  certain inherited blood clotting disorders  use of oral contraceptives  hormone replacement therapy  sedentary lifestyle  or obesity  and a prior history of PE.  In Summary: Mrs. Stevens represents a typical high-risk patient as identified in literature  given her age and risk factors including past major surgery and peripheral arterial disease. Her symptoms are highly suspicious for acute PE  and they warrant immediate and thorough investigations.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,53,Presentation Title: Late-Onset Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Patient Profile: The patient  Mrs. Eleanor Barton  is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman  non-smoker  with a history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following menopause  who has presented with acute  sudden-onset dyspnea  chest pain  and coughing. She described the chest pain as sharp and worsening with deep breathing (pleuritic in nature). Additionally  she reported a fleeting  streaking hemoptysis. Her BMI is 30 kg/m2  indicating obesity.   Demographics and Risk Factors:  Demographically  such a presentation is aligned with the literature indicating that Caucasian women over the age of 60 years  especially those on hormone replacement therapy  have an increased risk of developing acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Menopause induces a prothrombotic state  which results in a higher prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Moreover  women on HRT are twice as likely to develop VTE  including PE.  Past Medical History: The patient has been hypertensive for the past ten years and has been taking antihypertensive medication. She has also been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. Other than these  she has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations. She has no known allergies.   Family History: Mrs. Barton's family history reveals that her father had a stroke at 70  while her mother had multiple episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Conclusion: Taken together  Mrs. Barton's advanced age  hormone replacement therapy  ethnicity  obesity  personal medical history (hypertension  diabetes)  and family history of thrombotic events have predisposed her to develop an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,54,Title: Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Case: Mr. John Smith is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who arrived in the Emergency Department (ED) today complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath and a sharp  stabbing chest pain  which intensifies with deep breathing.   Demographics: According to recent medical literature  the average age of patients presenting with a first-time acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is usually between 60-65 years  with a higher prevalence in males  generally. In terms of ethnic distribution  PE is more frequent in African-Americans  followed by Caucasians  although it is found in all ethnicities. Mr. Smith’s ethnic and gender status thus align with these demographic findings.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has been under long-term treatment for hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago. He has been a regular smoker for the past 30 years but denies any illicit drug use. He underwent hip replacement surgery three weeks ago.  Mr. Smith’s multiple risk factors for PE include his older age  male sex  hypertension  diabetes  and recent major orthopedic surgery. The risk of PE is known to increase with age. Additionally  recent surgery - specifically orthopedic surgery - greatly increases the risk of thromboembolism because of the prolonged immobilization and direct vessel damage.   His long-term smoking habit also escalates his likelihood of developing PE  as smoking is a well-documented risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases.   Presentation: Upon examination  the patient appeared anxious and distressed. His blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg  the pulse was 110 /min  and respiratory rate was 26 /min. His oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. These vitals are alarming as they indicate the body's response to poor oxygen levels and the increased effort to pump blood.  Given the clinical presentation and risk profile  our primary suspicion is an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,55,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:   The patient is a 56-year-old African-American male named Mr. Johnson. He is from a lower-middle-class background  stressing the importance of considering socioeconomic impacts on health.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is a former smoker and quit smoking about five years ago  but had been a heavy smoker for almost 30 years. He also has a history of hypertension  well-controlled with medication. Apart from this  he has a largely sedentary lifestyle due to his job as a truck driver.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Johnson arrived at the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of breathlessness and chest pain that started two hours ago. The breathlessness has steadily increased over the last few hours. He also described a sense of feeling light-headed with spells of dizziness. There was no fever  cough  wheezing  or hemoptysis.   Clinical Findings:  An initial examination found him to be cyanotic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg. On auscultation  breath sounds appeared normal. Oxygen saturation on room air was 88%.  Diagnosis:  Given Mr. Johnson’s clinical presentation and his history of DVT  the clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was high. This was confirmed via a CT pulmonary angiogram  which showed presence of thrombus in the pulmonary arteries.   Public Health linkage:  Pulmonary embolism is more common in African American and Caucasian populations  as found in literature. Additionally  factors such as long term smoking  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  and a history of DVT could have contributed to Mr. Johnson’s current health situation. Literature shows poor socioeconomic status further increases the risk for PE due to inadequate access to healthcare  poor medication adherence  and potential for unhealthy lifestyle choices.  Conclusion:  Mr. Johnson's case illustrates the significant burden of pulmonary disease in lower socioeconomic populations  particularly among African American men. It highlights the importance of recognizing racial disparities in healthcare and working to ensure prompt access to necessary treatment. His medical treatment will likely include thrombolytics  anticoagulants  and supportive care alongside interventions to address his modifiable risk factors to reduce the risk of recurrence.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,56,Title: A Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any drug or substance abuse. His BMI is 30  indicating obesity.   Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and chronic atrial fibrillation. He has been on aspirin and metformin for the past five years. He also had a hip replacement surgery approximately three weeks ago.  Presenting Complaint: The patient complains about sudden onset of sharp  severe chest pain for the past couple of hours. He also mentions shortness of breath  palpitations  and a general feeling of being unwell.   Socio-economic Factors: The patient is a retired truck driver  living in semi-rural northeastern United States. He lives with his wife and has limited physical exercise  mainly due to his previous job nature and moderate arthritis. The patient has Medicare insurance  and his compliance to medication is relatively good.  Discussion: The patient’s demographic data aligns with the literature that most pulmonary embolism patients in the United States are aged over 65 years and are often Caucasian. Furthermore  literature review also shows that obesity  limited physical activity  recent surgery and chronic atrial fibrillation are critical risk factors for developing a venous thromboembolism  such as pulmonary embolism.   The patient's complaints  along with his medical history and risk factors  paint a clinical picture highly suspicious for acute pulmonary embolism. This presentation was created to illustrate a fairly typical case  acknowledging that every potential pulmonary embolism patient can present differently. Allocating appropriate clinical resources for prompt diagnosis and treatment is crucial in these patients due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with pulmonary embolism  which becomes more apparent with increasing age and complicating comorbidities.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,57,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Woman   Slide 1: - Introduction: We are going to discuss the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian female who presented with acute shortness of breath and chest pain which she rated as 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. With increasing age  the risk of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) also rises  with the highest incidence observed among adults aged over 60 years.  Slide 2: - Demographics & Past Medical History: Patient is retired and lives with her husband and adult son. She is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. Her BMI is 32 indicating obesity  a risk factor for PE. She has a history of hypertension and managed Type-II Diabetes Mellitus. She also reported sedentary lifestyle which could contribute to her condition.   Slide 3: - The patient does not report any known family history of embolic diseases. However  her medical history reveals she had a total knee replacement 2 months ago. Postsurgical patients  especially orthopedic surgery patients  have significantly increased risk for PE.  Slide 4: - Current Medications: The patient has been on Metformin for her diabetes and Lisinopril for her hypertension. She does not have a history of anticoagulant use  further contributing toward potential clot formation.  Slide 5: - Presumed Diagnosis &  Hospital Course: Based on her symptoms  examination (tachycardia and unilateral leg swelling) and her risk factors (age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  recent surgery  and non-use of anticoagulants)  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. Diagnostic tests such as D-dimer blood test  CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)  and an Ultrasound Doppler of the leg were advised to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was admitted to the hospital for symptom control and management.   Slide 6: - Conclusion: This case underlines the role of various factors such as age  obesity  immobility  and recent surgery in the onset of acute PE. It emphasizes the importance of prophylactic measures  lifestyle modification  and proper postoperative care in at-risk populations. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,58,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation   Patient Details:  Presenting a case of Mr. John Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and hypertension. Mr. Smith is a retired engineer who resides in metropolitan Detroit  Michigan  and has been a smoker for approximately 40 years.   History of Present Illness:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  sharp chest pain that becomes worse with deep breathing  and a mild cough with bloody sputum which started 2 hours prior to presentation. He also mentioned experiencing mild dizziness. He denied having fever  recent travel  or prolonged immobilization. Regarding his DVT history  he reported that he has not been very adherent to his prescribed anticoagulant medication.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with DVT two years ago. He also has been dealing with hypertension for the past 10 years  which is managed using Losartan. He has a history of intermittent tobacco and alcohol use.  Family History:  His paternal grandfather died from myocardial infarction and paternal grandmother had a stroke. His father has a history of DVT and his mother has hypertension. Notably  his younger brother was recently diagnosed with cancer.   Social History:  He is a widowed with one son and two daughters. He has been inactive since he retired two years ago. He smokes approximately one pack of cigarettes daily and drinks socially.  Discussion:  Given his medical history of DVT and hypertension  current symptoms  and life habits  the patient is at high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). This is consistent with the literature that suggests that advanced age  Caucasian heritage  male gender  history of DVT  hypertension  and smoking are major risk factors for PE.   Note:  This instance is fictional and any resemblance with a real case is coincidental. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,59,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Introduction:  Mrs. Maria Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic female  presents herself to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and dizziness which began earlier in the morning. When questioned about the duration and frequency of these symptoms  she confirms that they've been persisting for several hours now without any relief. She also expressed feeling faint with a sense of unease.  Past Medical History:   Mrs. Rodriguez has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus (DM)  hypertension (HTN)  and obesity (BMI of 32 kg/m2) which are managed with oral hypoglycemics  anti-hypertensives  and dietary restrictions. She was also diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) approximately two years ago following a long-haul flight  for which she completed a course of anticoagulant therapy. She has been off the treatment for DVT for over a year. She is a non-smoker and has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Current Clinical Presentation:  Currently  Mrs. Rodriguez's vital signs are concerning. She is tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 per minute  hypertensive with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 per minute. Her oxygen saturation level is 93% while breathing room air. Physical examination reveals an anxious-looking patient with clammy skin and mild cyanosis.  Preliminary Assessment:  Based on the preliminary assessment  Mrs. Rodriguez's symptoms and history suggest that she might be experiencing an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Her obesity  history of DVT  sedentary lifestyle  and age are major risk factors that could predispose her to a PE event. Female gender  history of hypertension  and diabetes are additional risk factors. Immediate diagnostic procedures and treatment initiation are necessary.  The case of Mrs. Rodriguez is not uncommon given that PE is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death  after coronary heart disease and stroke. PE often occurs among elderly patients and those with former DVT  with HTN  DM  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle serving as common risk factors. As PE has an acute onset and high mortality  prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial.

However  vigilance and routine follow-ups are necessary due to the patient's age and comorbidities.   Slide 11: Conclusion Effective management of acute PE involves prompt diagnosis  immediate anticoagulation treatment and consistent follow-up care.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,61,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Mr. William Thompson is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea after recently undergoing a hip replacement surgery three weeks ago. Mr. Thompson resides in a suburban neighborhood in Philadelphia  United States and is a retired engineer. His wife reported that he suddenly became pale  his breathing became rapid and he started to sweat profusely.   Medical History:  According to family members  Mr. Thompson has a medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both treated with medication. Moreover  he had a cholecystectomy two years ago and a left hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis three weeks ago. This recent surgery could be a major risk factor as surgeries often act as precipitating factors for thromboembolic events. Importantly  there's no record of smoking and alcohol. There's no history of drug abuse either. His mother suffered from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her older age.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient complained of sudden onset chest pain  which was sharp in nature and increased on taking deep breaths. He also experienced difficulty in breathing associated with sweating and a feeling of impending doom.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. Thompson was observed to be tachycardiac with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was 130/85 mm Hg and oxygen saturation on room air was 92%. Auscultation of the chest showed decreased breath sounds on the left side.  Based on his apparent acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea  post-surgical status  family history of DVT and physical examination findings  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. Further diagnostic tests including d-dimer assays  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and echocardiogram were recommended.  In conclusion  it is important to recognize that acute pulmonary embolism can manifest with a range of symptoms from mild dyspnea to severe chest pain and shock  as demonstrated in Mr. Thompson's case. A clear understanding of the patient's medical history  demographics and clinical presentation plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment to improve patient outcomes. Successful management includes confirming the diagnosis  stabilizing the patient's condition  and initiating anticoagulant therapy if necessary.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,62,Title: Acute Pulinary Embolism in the Aging Population - A Case Study  I. Introduction  Today  I will provide a brief presentation on a recent patient diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism (APE).   II. Demographic Information  The patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who lives in an urban city in the Eastern United States. His professional background is in engineering and he's a retired individual  living with his wife. The choice of a patient from this age group and demographic is reflective of the prevalence of APE  which is increasing with age  mostly affecting people over the age of 60. Multiple studies have shown that Caucasian populations and urban communities are at a higher risk for acute pulmonary embolism.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history. He's a former smoker  having quit approximately 20 years ago. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes fifteen years ago  which is well managed through diet and metformin. In addition  he has been struggling with obesity for several years. He was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol ten years ago  and both conditions are managed by medications.   Five years ago  he underwent a knee replacement surgery which went without complications. However  he led a sedentary lifestyle after that which resulted in weight gain and decreased mobility. Unfortunately  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with congestive heart failure two years ago  and he's been managed with medication and a low-sodium diet.  As is consistent with the literature  Mr. Doe's age  sedentary lifestyle  history of congestive heart failure  obesity  recent major surgery  and other comorbidities render him a classic demographic for APE.   IV. Pulmonary Embolism Presentation  Upon his admission to the Emergency Department  Mr. Doe reported sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain (especially upon deep breathing)  and a cough which sometimes produced blood-streaked sputum. He also reported light-headedness and a fainting episode.  V. Conclusion  Mr. Doe's case is a typical example of acute pulmonary embolism and reinforces the importance of early detection and intervention  especially in high-risk groups. The experiences of patients like Mr. Doe underscore the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for APE in patients with similar demographic and clinical characteristics  and the importance of initiating prompt  effective treatment to improve patient outcomes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,63,Introduction:  Today's presentation discusses a patient presenting with symptoms of an acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE).  Demographics Information:  Our patient is Mr. J  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  which coincides with the higher risk group for PE as per epidemiological studies. A non-smoker and social drinker  he is retired and lives with his wife in a suburban area. He has a BMI of 28  which indicates being overweight  a risk factor for developing blood clots.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Simvastatin respectively. He also underwent unilateral total knee replacement surgery four weeks ago. His postoperative recovery was uneventful  and he was not on postoperative anticoagulation. There is no family history of clotting disorders but a significant history of cardiovascular diseases.   Present Illness:  Mr. J presented to the emergency department with progressive sudden-onset dyspnea and chest pain that started approximately 6 hours before arrival. He describes the chest pain as sharp  localized to the right side  and worse with deep breathing. He also mentioned becoming lightheaded twice over the last few hours but didn't lose consciousness. He denies fever  cough  hemoptysis  recent travel  or prolonged immobilization.   Conclusion:  Given Mr. J's age  recent surgery without postoperative anticoagulation  and symptoms  the clinical suspicion of an acute Pulmonary Embolism is high. Appropriate triage and evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and appropriate management strategies are of utmost priority to reduce morbidity and mortality in such cases. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,64,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged African American Female  Patient Profile: - Name: Anonymous - Age: 52 years - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: African-American  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. The symptoms have persisted for 3 hours  and the level of intensity seems to be increasing gradually.  Medical History: The patient tested positive for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  and her treatment included an anticoagulant  Coumadin. Upon inquiry  she admitted to being non-compliant with her medication due to side effects that included excessive bruising.  Further  she has a history of obesity  with a Body-Mass-Index (BMI) of 32. She was diagnosed with type II diabetes four years ago and is managing it with metformin 500mg tablets twice daily.  Social History: The patient is a former smoker  having quit 8 years ago after a tobacco addiction of 2 packs per day for 20 years. She admits to being a moderate alcohol consumer with no history of drug abuse.  Family History: Her family history is significant  with her mother having suffered a stroke at the age of 60  and an elder sister diagnosed with DVT and later developing post-thrombotic syndrome.  Rationale: The demographic details of this case have been carefully selected to mirror the epidemiological findings on PE (Pulmonary Embolism). Research indicates that African Americans have a higher incidence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)  which includes DVT and PE  and females being slightly more at risk than males. Also  individuals aged 40 to 60 years old are more frequently diagnosed with PE. Relevant risk factors  such as obesity  diabetes  previous history of DVT  and non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy  prevalent in this population  have also been highlighted. These details allow this presentation to adhere to an accurate representation based on literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,65,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Female Patient   Introduction:  We present the case of Mrs. Maria Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of Stage II Hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. She is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband of 40 years  and has two adult children. As per CDC data  elderly females have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism  including Pulmonary Embolism.  Presenting Complaints:   Mrs. Lopez arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens upon taking a deep breath  and sweating. She also reported feelings of fear for her life.  Clinical Examination:   On physical examination  Mrs. Lopez appeared anxious  was breathing rapidly (tachypnea) and with difficulty  and had a slightly elevated heart rate (tachycardia) at 110 beats per minute. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) was low  at 92%  despite receiving supplemental oxygen. Her blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 mmHg.   Medical History:    Mrs. Lopez has a medical history significant for Hypertension  for which she takes Amlodipine  and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  controlled with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. She also mentioned a recent total knee replacement surgery three weeks prior  after which she was immobile for nearly a week. She mentioned that she had discontinued her prophylactic anticoagulation (low-molecular weight heparin) a week ago due to concerning bruises.  Management:  Given her clinical presentation and recent history of major surgery followed by immobility  an Acute Pulmonary Embolism was suspected. We administered supplemental oxygen  initiated intravenous access  and started anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin. We then proceeded with further diagnostics  including a D-Dimer test  computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis.   Conclusion:  In our case  Mrs. Lopez  given her age  gender  recent surgery  and abrupt discontinuation of her prophylactic anticoagulant  fell into a high-risk category for a potential Pulmonary Embolism. Thus  her case underlines the importance of vigilance in recognizing the signs of this potentially deadly condition  especially in high-risk patients. It also stresses the need for educating patients about the importance of maintaining anticoagulation therapy post-surgery to prevent thromboembolic events.  (Note: This presentation is an educational illustration and does not represent a real patient case.)
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,66,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Post-Menopausal Female  Patient Profile: - Name: Mrs. Jane Doe - Age: 62 Years Old - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: White  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Jane Doe presents with sudden shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens upon deep breathing  and an unexplained cough. Noted distress is evident.  Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago and controlled by daily medication. - Hypercholesterolemia: Diagnosed 10 years ago and controlled by oral statins. - Menopause: Transitioned at age 49  hormone replacement therapy used for 4 years thereafter. - Tubal ligation: Performed at age 35 following completion of family - Non-smoker  moderate alcohol use.  Family History: - Father died of a heart attack at age 72. - Mother alive at age 85  diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. - One younger sister diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 years of age.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  Mrs. Doe exhibits signs of tachycardia  with HR of 120 BPM  and an elevated blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is noted to be 28 breaths per minute  with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. She has moderate obesity (BMI: 32). No leg swelling or tenderness is observed. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in lower lobes of both lungs.  Suspicion: Given her medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  as well as her presenting symptoms  there is a high suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion: Mrs. Jane Doe is a post-menopausal woman with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  who presents with characteristic symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism - sudden chest pain  shortness of breath and cough. This profile is representative of the typical demographic of patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism  where the risk increases with age and is more prevalent in women  specifically those with obesity and a history of hormone replacement therapy. Clinical confirmation with additional investigations and subsequent appropriate treatment is vital for her prognosis.   Note: This observation is in line with the epidemiology defined in the literature  which recognizes post-menopausal females with a history of obesity and hormone therapy as a significant risk group for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,67,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-aged African American Female  Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 56-year-old African American female  known to medical services with a history of hypertension  obesity (BMI 32)  and type II diabetes. She is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol regularly. She is also a retired school teacher and remains fairly sedentary  predominantly due to fatigue and chronic pain related to osteoarthritis. She lives with her husband and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   This patient presents to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis over the past 6 hours. She also reports experiencing increased fatigue and leg swelling for the past week. She denies fever  cough  or recent travel.   Upon presentation  she appears anxious and mildly diaphoretic. On physical examination  she is found to have tachypnea  tachycardia  and mildly elevated blood pressure. Lower extremity examination reveals unilateral calf swelling and tenderness on the left side  indicative of possible Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds at the left lung base.  Her past medical history is significant for the following: 1. Hypertension 2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus 3. Obesity 4. Osteoarthritis  Chronic medication list includes: 1. Lisinopril for hypertension 2. Metformin for Type II Diabetes 3. Paracetamol as needed for osteoarthritis pain  Impression: The acute onset of pleuritic chest pain  shortness of breath  and hemoptysis in the setting of recent symptoms of left lower extremity DVT in a patient with numerous risk factors – including age  obesity  diabetes  and hypertension – raises high clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism.  Summary: This case highlights a typical scenario of pulmonary embolism  which occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults  and slightly more common in African American population. The significant risk factors presented are representative of a typical patient demographic that may experience a pulmonary embolism. This patient’s situation also underscores the link between sedentary lifestyle and venous thromboembolism  and the importance of considering such conditions in the emergency setting. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,68,Title: Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Background: Mrs. J is a 70-year-old Caucasian woman  residing in rural area  recently retired as a school teacher. She has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  which are well controlled on medication. She is a non-smoker and her alcohol consumption is minimal. She lives with her husband who is a retired law enforcement officer. Her BMI is 29 indicating obesity  an additional risk factor for Pulmonary Embolism (PE).   Presentation: Mrs. J initially noticed unpredictable and persistent shortness of breath for the past two days  along with mild to moderate chest discomfort with some degree of orthopnoea. She originally thought it was due to her anxiety or her hypertension medicine but her symptoms persisted even at rest. This resulted in her attending the emergency department.  Diagnostic Assessment: On physical examination  her blood pressure was slightly elevated  she had tachycardia and her oxygen saturation was on lower side of normal. On auscultation  her heart sounds were normal but her breath sounds seemed mildly diminished. Her D-Dimer test was found to be high. A confirmatory Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) revealed an acute pulmonary embolism.   Past Medical History: Mrs. J's medical history is significant for systemic hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  diagnosed 10 years ago  both managed through lifestyle modification and medications. Additionally  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery six weeks ago  which could have led to a period of immobility  a well recognized risk factor for deep vein thrombosis and subsequent embolism.  This case corresponds with current literature as acute PE is more common in the elderly and is often associated with comorbid conditions such as hypertension  hyperlipidaemia and post-surgery scenarios. Obesity  another significant risk factor for PE  is also seen in this case. In most cases  PE presents as sudden onset dyspnea  tachypnea  and chest discomfort as seen with Mrs. J. Frequent diagnoses in such cases involve use of D-Dimer testing and confirmatory CTPA scanning.  Management Plan: Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay in the management of PE. Given her medical history  appropriate therapy will be initiated under close supervision. Patient education about maintaining mobility when possible  adequate hydration and the importance of adhering to medication regimen is also paramount to her recovery and prevention of any future events. Mrs. J will benefit from a structured follow-up plan  including reassessment of her anticoagulation regime  blood pressure and lipid profile monitoring. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,69,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Postmenopausal Female  Slide 1: Patient Introduction Patient: Mrs. Karen Smith  a 62-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female. Mrs. Smith is a non-smoker with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.  Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms Mrs. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain (pleuritic in nature)  and palpitations. She also reported a recent long-haul flight 7 days ago.  Slide 3: Relevant Past Medical History  Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is also known to have hyperlipidemia. She had undergone hormonal replacement therapy for five years after menopause  which she stopped 2 years ago. She also had an uneventful knee replacement surgery two months ago and was largely bed-ridden during the recovery phase.    Slide 4: Family History Her family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis in her mother  who was diagnosed in her late 60s.   Slide 5: Investigations Initial investigations include chest X-ray  electrocardiogram (ECG)  and D-dimer test. Subsequent confirmatory investigation includes CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Other relevant tests include complete blood count (CBC)  prothrombin time (PT)  and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).  Slide 6: Demographic Representation Mrs. Smith falls in line with common demographics for pulmonary embolism  with risk factors including advanced age  prolonged immobility  recent surgery  hormone replacement therapy  and a family history of venous thromboembolism. According to data  PE is more common in individuals over 60  and the age-adjusted incidence in women is lower than in men except at older ages where incidence rates converge. Her case also serves as a reminder of the higher risk for pulmonary embolism associated with long-haul travel due to prolonged sitting.   Slide 7: Proposed Treatment and Follow-up Thrombolytic therapy or anticoagulation therapy will be initiated based on the severity of pulmonary emboli and risk stratification. Regular follow-up and monitoring will be mandatory. Review and adjustments of her current medication regime for her diabetes and hypertension will also be considered.  References: 1. Beckman  M.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,70,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   I. Introduction   This case presentation involves a 62-year-old Caucasian female who presented at the emergency department (ED) with clinical symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This demographic is consistent with epidemiological studies  where PE commonly affects patients of this age group  and Caucasians are more predisposed due to certain genetic factors like Factor V Leiden mutation.   II. Patient Information and Medical History   The patient  Mrs. J.D  is a retired teacher from Huntington  West Virginia. She has a significant medical history that includes Hypertension (HTN) and Hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively. She also had a previous Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  following a hip replacement surgery. She denies tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use but has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with her mother experiencing a stroke at the age of 70.   III. Current Presentation   Mrs. J.D came in with acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and some episodes of coughing up blood. She rates her chest pain as a 7/10  describing it as a sharp and stabbing pain that worsens on deep breaths. She also reported pleuritic chest pain and palpitations. On examination  her blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg  her pulse 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 92% while breathing ambient air.   IV. Assessment and Plan   A preliminary diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered given her history and current presenting symptoms. Having been recognized as a high-risk patient due to prior DVT and postoperative state from the hip replacement  she was immediately sent for an electrocardiogram (EKG)  chest X-Ray  D-dimer assay  and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).   In conclusion  Mrs. J.D’s case highlights the critical importance of considering a pulmonary embolism when a patient presents with signs of hypoxia  chest pain  and dyspnea. This is especially significant if the patient has risk factors such as a history of previous DVT or hypercoagulable state.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,71,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  The subject of this case presentation is a 66-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a condition characterized by sudden blockage of a lung artery usually by a blood clot. The disease predominantly affects individuals over the age of 60  and females are often more susceptible than males due to risk factors such as hormone therapy and pregnancy.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was diagnosed eight years ago following an extended period of bed rest due to a hip fracture. Other past medical history includes hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. She is a non-smoker and does not have a family history of pulmonary embolism or any genetic clotting disorder.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaint  The patient presented in the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that began three hours prior to presentation. She states the chest pain becomes severe upon deep inspiration.   Slide 4: Physical Examination/ Signs and Symptoms  Physical examination revealed increased heart rate (tachycardia) and decreased oxygen saturation (hypoxia). The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress  including rapid breaths and cyanosis (bluish or purplish discoloration on lips and fingers). No leg swelling or redness was reported.   Slide 5: Risk Factor  Major risk factors for the patient include her age  history of DVT  and limited mobility due to chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore  she recently underwent hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms  which could contribute to her predisposition to clotting.  Slide 6: Conclusion   Given the patient’s medical history  current symptoms  and demographic characteristics  an acute pulmonary embolism diagnosis is suspected. The management plan includes confirming the diagnosis with a CT pulmonary angiography and starting anticoagulant therapy promptly. She will also need a follow-up check with her primary care physician for medication adjustment and monitoring for recurrence of DVT.  Slide 7: References   This slide should include references to provide evidence-based support for your presentation.   Remember that each patient case is unique and this represents a typical presentation of a patient dealing with acute pulmonary embolism. Regular check-ups and individualized care are vital for effective treatment and recovery.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,72,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Thomas Williams  a 60-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Williams presents with sudden-onset shortness of breath  anxiety  pleuritic chest pain  and light-headedness that started a couple of hours ago. He denied sensation of palpitations or fainting spells. He stated that he has been less mobile lately due to work from home setup amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He conveys no history of fever  chills  cough  or contact with a person with respiratory illness.   Demographics: Mr. Williams is a non-smoker  and his BMI falls within the “Overweight” category. He drinks alcohol in moderation and does not use recreational drugs. He lives with his wife in a suburban community. He is a retired police officer who now works as a part-time private security consultant from home. He has no travel or occupational exposures that heighten his risk for pulmonary embolism.   Medical History: Mr. Williams was diagnosed with non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago. He also has a history of hypertension under control with medication. He has no known drug allergies. His father died at age 65 of a heart attack  and his mother  aged 85  is alive and has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Apart from these  he has no significant surgical or hospitalization history. Family history doesn’t indicate a high risk for clotting disorders.  Conclusion: For this patient  the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath in context with recent sedentariness raises a significant suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism. He should be evaluated immediately and undergo diagnostic procedures  including a D-dimer test  coagulation studies  and imaging studies like CT pulmonary angiography  depending on his overall clinical scenario and the potential need for therapeutic intervention.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,73,"Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Albert Turner Age: 65 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer  Chief Complaint: Complaints of sudden onset severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness.  Present Illness: Symptoms started abruptly 3 hours ago. Mr. Turner was at rest and began experiencing pain in his chest which he describes as """"sharp"""" and “worst pain ever"""". The pain is localized in the center chest area and became worse with breathing in. The intensity of the pain resulted in lightheadedness and shortness of breath  prompting his wife to bring him to the emergency room. He denies previous similar episodes.   Past Medical History: Mr. Turner is diagnosed with hypertension for 10 years which is controlled on medication. He is also a former smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking 5 years back. There is a history of deep vein thrombosis in his right leg about 2 years ago when he hadn't moved for several hours on a long-distance flight.   Family History: Father died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70. Mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes. One younger brother has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Medications:  Taking anti-hypertension drugs (Lisinopril daily) and statins (Atorvastatin evening).  Social History: He is a teetotaller and doesn’t use any recreational drugs. He has been leading a mostly sedentary lifestyle since retirement. He lives with his wife in their family home.  Review of Systems: No fever  cough  sputum  hemoptysis  headache  fainting  palpitations  leg swelling  or recent surgeries.  In this case presentation  we have chosen a 65-year-old Caucasian male as the typical patient to represent acute pulmonary embolism. According to literature  pulmonary embolism has a higher incidence among the elderly  males  and Caucasians. Also  individuals with a history of venous thromboembolism  like DVT in our patient  are at a higher risk of developing PE. The patient's hypertension  smoking history  and sedentary lifestyle are further risk factors for the development of the condition."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,74,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Slide 1: Patient's Demographic Information  Patient X is a 62-year-old  overweight Caucasian female with a BMI of 28.5  presented to the emergency room complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient lives in a suburban area with middle-class socioeconomic status  and has a history of sedentary lifestyle and low physical activity levels.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are currently managed with medication. She was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes five years ago and manages it through diet  exercise  and antidiabetic medication. There is also a family history of cardiovascular diseases  particularly  her father died from a heart attack at the age of 65.  Slide 3: Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism  Patient X is postmenopausal  which increases her risk for venous thromboembolism  as does a past history of a minor stroke three years ago  for which she has been on low-dose aspirin therapy. Significant risk factors include obesity  prolonged periods of physical inactivity  and past history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). She also mentioned recent travel where she was seated on a plane for over four hours.  Slide 4: Symptom Presentation  Presenting symptoms include sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  dyspnea  tachypnea  tachycardia  and a general sense of anxiety. On examination  the patient was found with low oxygen saturation levels.  Slide 5: Proposed Diagnosis & Management  Combining the patient's predisposing factors  symptoms  and preliminary examination  an acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Further examination including D-diner testing  CT pulmonary angiography  and echocardiography would be recommended for confirmation. Management would include administration of anticoagulants for initial stabilization  followed by long-term anticoagulation therapy  and lifestyle modification counselling. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,75,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Profile:   The patient is a 61-year-old  Caucasian male named John with a BMI of 29. His primary language is English. He is a retired engineer living in Essex  United Kingdom. John is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history and quit smoking ten years ago. His alcohol use is moderate.  Medical History:  John has a long-standing history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. He is also a post-operative patient who recently underwent right hip replacement nearly three weeks ago. His other significant medical history preparedness includes hyperlipidemia  obesity  and a family history of deep vein thrombosis  suggesting possible genetic predisposition. He is currently on medications including Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Symptoms and Clinical Examination:  John presented to the emergency department with acute onset of dyspnea  chest pain worsened by inspiration  lightheadedness  and slight hemoptysis  suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. On examination  he appears anxious and is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. He is also tachycardic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. His blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/95 mmHg  and his oxygen saturation is 89% on room air.   In summary  John's symptoms  recent surgery  established medical history including obesity and predisposition to thrombosis  all point towards a possible acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests are necessary for confirmation and subsequent initiation of anticoagulant therapy. His case emphasizes the importance of considering venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in post-operative patients  especially those with additional risk factors. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,76,Title: A Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism   1. Introduction:  Patient identifying information:  Mr. John Anderson is a 55-year-old African-American male residing in Detroit  Michigan. He is a never-smoker  retired metal worker with a BMI of 28  which classifies him as overweight.   2. Past Medical History:  Mr. Anderson was diagnosed with hypertension a decade ago and is currently medicated with lisinopril. He has also suffered from Type II diabetes mellitus for approximately 15 years that he manages with metformin. Additionally  he has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago. He takes 75mg of daily aspirin as prophylaxis. Mr. Anderson reports no known drug allergies.  3. Presenting Complaint: The patient arrived at the emergency department reporting sudden onset shortness of breath associated with chest pain. The discomfort was described as a sharp stabbing pain  getting worse while inhaling. The patient also complains of profuse sweating and light-headedness.  4. Epidemiology: According to the literature  African-American males aged 45 to 64 have an incidence rate of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) of 78.2 per 100 000. The risk factors that potentially contributed to the development of PE in this patient include his sex  age  past history of DVT  uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  being overweight  and sedentary lifestyle after retirement.  5. Summary: The above information  including demographic data  past medical history  and presenting symptoms  help clinch the diagnosis towards a likely Acute PE. The demographic information and medical past is typical for patients presenting with PE  and is pertinent given Mr. Anderson's past history of DVT and existing chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes which enhance his risk profile.   However  to confirm this  further investigations like chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) or ventilation-perfusion scan would be required  followed by suitable management of the condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,77,Presenter: Dr. James Takamura  Patient Profile:  - Name: Mrs. Linda Brown - Age: 68 years old - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Socioeconomic Status: Middle class - Residence: Lives alone in a suburban neighborhood in Dallas  Texas - Smoking status: Non-smoker - Alcohol consumption: Occasional/social drinker  Presenting complaint:  Mrs. Brown presents with symptoms that have been progressively getting worse over the course of 2-3 days. These symptoms include breathlessness  chest pain under the sternum that gets worse with deep breathing  anxiety  cough (sometimes with bloody sputum)  and lower leg pain and swelling (one leg more than the other).   Past medical history:  Mrs. Brown had hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. She claims to have adhered to her post-operative instructions and has been on follow-up with her Orthopaedic Surgeon regularly. However  she has been less mobile since the surgery due to the recovery process. Other than this  she has been generally healthy with no known history of heart diseases  liver diseases  or respiratory ailments. She does not have diabetes  hypertension  or any other chronic conditions. She is not on any regular medications other than a regular low dose of aspirin for general heart health recommended by her primary care physician.  Family history: Her mother had deep vein thrombosis in her sixties. Her father had coronary artery disease  but no history of thromboembolic events.  Social history: She is a widow with 2 adult children  both of whom live out of state. She has a healthy social life  participating in usual activities at a local seniors' activity center. She denied drug use.  Impression:  Given her recent immobility  presenting symptoms  and family history  there is a high suspicion of acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Further tests including D-dimer  CT pulmonary angiography  and Ultrasound of the lower extremities are scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and to decide on the appropriate treatment approach.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,78,Title: Clinical Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Female Patient  Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Patient is a 67-year-old African American female named Mrs. Elizabeth Brown who presents to the emergency room with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and fainting.   Slide 2: Patient's Background Mrs. Brown is a retired school teacher living in Michigan. She is widowed with two adult children. She has never smoked  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a moderate activity level.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. Brown was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus and hypertension 10 years ago  both of which are managed through medication and lifestyle modifications. Four months ago  she underwent hip replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis but had an uncomplicated recovery until now.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms Mrs. Brown reports difficulty in breathing that began suddenly earlier in the day  especially when climbing stairs. She also describes severe  heavy chest pain that does not radiate elsewhere. She also fainted once at home before she was brought to the emergency department.  Slide 5: Initial Diagnosis Given the sudden onset of symptoms and her previous surgical history  an initial diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. She displays the classic symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism  which includes breathlessness  chest pain and fainting.  Slide 6: Demographic Representation Studies have shown that African Americans have a higher risk of venous thromboembolism  including pulmonary embolism  as compared to White Americans. In addition  women  especially those in their post-menopausal phase  are at a higher risk for blood clots. Since our patient just had a recent surgery  this further increases her chances for developing a clot.  Slide 7: Conclusion and Further Plans  Mrs. Brown's symptoms  in line with her demographic risk and her recent hip surgery  strongly suggest a case of acute pulmonary embolism and potential deep vein thrombosis. Further testing with Computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and D-dimer blood tests  with potential initiation of anticoagulant use will be necessary steps for accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,80,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Mr. R.L. is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired automotive mechanic  a widower  and a resident of New Jersey. His only child lives nearby and is his primary caretaker.  Past Medical History:  Mr. R.L. has a medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and peripheral vascular disease. He underwent right hip arthroplasty six months prior. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) five years ago. Mr. R.L. is a former smoker with a 30-year pack history. He quit 10 years ago. His medications include aspirin  metformin  and lisinopril.   Presenting History:  Mr. R.L. presented with a three-day history of progressive shortness of breath. He also complained of pleuritic chest pain and palpitations. He reported a sudden onset of symptoms which occurred without any known trigger. His caretaker daughter mentioned that he has been less active since his hip surgery and often sits for prolonged periods.   Clinical Exam:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. He appeared anxious and distressed. His cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia but was otherwise normal. Respiratory examination showed decreased breath sounds in the base of the right lung. No peripheral swelling or pitting edema was noted.  Evaluation:  The characteristics of the patient's clinical presentation  in combination with his history of recent surgery and limited mobility  suggest a high probability of acute pulmonary embolism. Urgent diagnostic testing will be undertaken including EKG  chest radiography  D-dimer testing  and CT pulmonary angiography.  Population Demographics:  Mr. R.L.'s case is consistent with demographic and risk factor trends noted in the literature for acute pulmonary embolism. Caucasian males over the age of 60 with comorbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and a history of surgery represent a significant portion of patients diagnosed with this condition. Limited mobility and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to increased risk. The acute onset of symptoms and clinical findings supports the preliminary diagnosis.   In conclusion  the case of Mr. R.L. exemplifies the classic presentation of acute pulmonary embolism in a high-risk patient. The urgency of diagnosis and management in these cases emphasizes the need for early recognition of risk factors and symptoms among primary care providers. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,81,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with symptoms characteristic of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Literature indicates a slight predominance of PE in males  with an even higher prevalence in African Americans compared to Caucasians.  Chief Complaint:   The patient reports experiencing sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain which is worse on deep inspiration – known as pleuritic chest pain – and mild hemoptysis (coughing up blood)  which started about 12 hours before arrival.  History of Present Illness:   The subject's symptoms reportedly developed suddenly while he was sitting and reading. He denies trauma. He reports having taken a long trip by car a week ago that lasted for more than 8 hours. He denies exposure to known infectious agents or any recent surgeries.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) approximately five years ago  with a successful treatment course. He denies any known malignancy  heart disease  or lung disease.  Personal/Social History:   He is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and denies illicit drug use. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Medications:   He reports regularly taking his prescribed medications which include metformin for diabetes and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. He has no known drug allergies.  Review of Systems:   Aside from the symptoms related to PE  review of systems is relatively unremarkable. The patient denies other complaints such as limbs swelling  pain or recent fever.  Physical Examination:   Vitals show he is tachycardic and tachypneic  with oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Chest examination reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable  including no signs of DVT.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  we have a 67-year-old African American male patient  with a past medical history of DVT  hypertension  and diabetes presenting with acute shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. These symptoms  along with his past medical history  suggest an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  This case serves as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging past medical history and potential risk factors when assessing a patient's presenting symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach involving emergency providers  radiologists  and possibly pulmonologists or cardiologists  will be crucial in confirming diagnosis and determining the appropriate treatment for this patient.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,82,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Clinical Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The patient is a 61-year-old African American female by the name of Mrs. Johnson. She resides in Chicago  Illinois  with her retired husband and pet dog. She is a non-smoker  but has a history of a sedentary lifestyle that has led to obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.2. English is her primary language  but she is also fluent in Spanish due to her long career as a school teacher in a multilingual environment.   Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  which have been managed with medication for the past nine years. She also has osteoarthritis in her knees but has been avoiding knee replacement surgery due to the potential risk of thrombosis. Her mother and one of her sisters passed away from heart-related illnesses  indicating a possible genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.   Current Presentation: She presented at the emergency department experiencing sudden shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and sharp chest pain radiating towards her back. Her vitals showed tachycardia  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 134/86 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. These symptoms had initiated about two hours prior to her emergency room visit  following a 3-hour long car ride. The constellation of her symptoms  given her medical history and recent period of prolonged immobility  raised the suspicion of a possible Acute Pulmonary Embolism.   Initial blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-dimer  prompting an immediate Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)  which confirmed the presence of a clot in her right pulmonary artery  corroborating the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.   It is imperative to note that Acute Pulmonary Embolism is often underdiagnosed and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors such as age  obesity  prolonged immobilization  personal or family history of venous thromboembolism  and existing cardiovascular diseases can contribute towards an increased risk for this condition. Hence  disease awareness  precise diagnosis  and prompt treatment are crucial.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,83,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Presentation   Patient Information: Mr. Robert Johnson  a 59-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain and feeling lightheaded. The patient is a former smoker  having quit five years ago but with a previous smoking history of 35 pack-years. He's leading a sedentary life due to his work as a cab driver in Newark  New Jersey.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and hypertension 5 years ago. Both conditions are being managed with oral medications. In addition  he has a history of deep vein thrombosis following a long-haul flight about three years ago  which was treated with anticoagulants for six months. He reports no known drug allergies.   Personal and Social History: Mr. Johnson is a married father of three children  the youngest of whom is a senior in high school. He reports moderate alcohol use and denies any illicit drug use. He lives with his wife and youngest son  while his two older children are living abroad.   Considering the demographics and the past medical history of the patient  he possesses multiple risk factors for acute pulmonary embolism including advanced age  African American race  previous DVT  sedentary lifestyle  and a history of long-term smoking.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,84,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation  Patient Presentation: We are presenting a case of a 60-year-old Caucasian female patient  Mrs. A  who came to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp chest pain that worsened with deep breathing. She noted that her symptoms began four hours ago while she was cooking at home. Cold sweats and light-headedness accompanied the pain.  Demographics:  Mrs. A is a resident of a suburban community and a retired school teacher. She has been living alone since her husband passed away two years ago. She is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption  which she quit five years ago.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. A has a history of hypertension for which she was prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide. She was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes mellitus two years ago and is currently taking Metformin. Additionally  she has a history of osteoarthritis for which she occasionally takes NSAIDs. She suffered a right hip fracture about three months ago for which she underwent surgery and was immobilized for a month. During her recovery  she mentioned she was largely sedentary.  Emergency Department Presentation: Upon arrival at the emergency department  she was visibly distressed. Her vital signs indicated tachypnea  tachycardia  and decreased oxygen saturation. Focused physical examination revealed clear lung fields and a regular rhythm without murmur on cardiac auscultation. Her leg examination did not indicate any signs of deep vein thrombosis.   Impression: Considering Mrs. A's acute onset of dyspnea  chest pain  recent history of surgery with immobility and her risk factors of age  hypertension  and diabetes  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected.   This presentation emphasizes that acute pulmonary embolism can present in patients with multiple co-morbid conditions  which can contribute to their overall risk. Notably  recent surgery and sedentary lifestyle post-surgery are substantial risk factors for the development of acute pulmonary embolism. This case underlines the necessity of considering pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute unexplained dyspnea  especially those with associated risk factors.   Sources: Wang  C.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,85,Title: A Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Introduction: Mr. Dave Robinson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and palpitations.  Demographiс Representation: Worldwide  pulmonary embolism affects about 1.1 million people every year. In the United States  PE is more prevalent among African-Americans. The age-adjusted incidence is reportedly high for 65 years and older. Statistically  men are slightly more likely to suffer from PE than women  with the popular M:F ratio being 1.12:1.   Medical History: Mr. Robinson has been professionally inactive for the last five years post his retirement. He smokes 20 cigarettes a day and enjoys his alcohol occasionally. His past medical history reveals that he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a total knee replacement 3 years ago. He was treated with warfarin for six months post-surgery  then discontinued anticoagulation treatment.   Mr. Robinson also has been battling hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) for the last 10 years. His medication includes daily metformin and lisinopril. He was not on any regular exercise program. His family history is significant for heart disease.   Signs and Symptoms: Upon examination  Mr. Robinson was found to be in mild distress  his blood pressure was elevated  heart rate was fast and irregular  and oxygen saturation was a bit low. He reported acute shortness of breath and chest pain  precisely described as a sharp  stabbing pain  worsened during deep breaths. On auscultation  his breath sounds were found to be harsh and there was tachycardia.  This presentation highlights the urgent need for medical attention to manage his acute pulmonary embolism symptoms. His age  history of DVT  smoking habit  physical inactiveness  hypertension  DM  and family history of heart disease  all place him at higher risk for PE.  Initial measures must be taken to ensure patient stabilization  and diagnostic tests  including D-Dimer assays  chest computed tomography  EKG  and lung VQ scan  should be employed to affirm the preliminary diagnosis. Following that  a multidisciplinary approach is to be initiated for Mr. Robinson's optimal therapeutic management.   This case underscores the urgency of patient education about the risks of PE recurrence  importance of anticoagulation therapy adherence  smoking cessation  and adopting an active lifestyle.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,86,"Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in a Postmenopausal Female  Patient Presentation & Demographics:  Ms. Jennifer Wilson  a 67-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness which started a few hours ago. She also mentioned that she had been feeling """"off and on"""" fatigue over the past week.  Her Physical Appearance: Ms. Wilson appeared anxious and acutely distressed. On physical examination  she was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute)  slightly tachycardic (heart rate of 102 beats per minute)  and her oxygen saturation on room air was 92%. Blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg.  Past Medical History: Ms. Wilson’s past medical history is significant for systemic hypertension  for which she takes medication  and she has been postmenopausal for 15 years. Additionally  she underwent total knee replacement surgery four weeks ago. She is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol or use drugs. No family history of pulmonary embolism or coagulation disorders is noted. Also  she has no known allergies.  Recent history reveals that post her knee surgery  she had limited mobility and was largely bedridden  which likely serves as a risk factor. Though outpatient physiotherapy was advised  Ms. Wilson reported compliance issues due to transportation problems and COVID-19 related fear.  Data Interpretation: Given her recent surgery with post-operative reduced mobility  along with her acute shortness of breath  chest pain  and hypoxia  there is a high clinical suspicion of acute PE. As per demographics matching age  gender  and ethnicity  Ms. Wilson fits into the typical profile of PE patients  as majority of PE cases are reported among elderly and white individuals. Further diagnostic procedures  including computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  may be needed for definitive diagnosis and to guide treatments.  In conclusion  Ms. Wilson’s case appears to represent a typical case of acute PE in a postmenopausal woman  with possible contributing factors being advanced age  recent major surgery  and post-operative reduced mobility."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,87,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Presentation  Patient: Ms. Maria Gonzales  a 55-year-old Hispanic female  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and a cough with blood-tinged sputum.  Demographics: According to AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)  Hispanic females aged 45-64 are a significant demographic group affected by pulmonary embolism.   History: Ms. Gonzales is a married teacher residing in San Francisco  California. She denies smoking or use of illicit drugs but admits to moderate alcohol intake.   Past Medical History: Ms. Gonzales was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia three years ago. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from two years ago and was treated with anticoagulation therapy. Ms. Gonzales reports she is still on anticoagulation therapy but is unsure of her medication adherence. She is also on medication for her hypertension and hyperlipidemia but does not remember their names.   Family History: Her mother passed away at 62 due to coronary artery disease  and her father is alive at 85 with a medical history of stroke. She has two older siblings; one brother diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 50 and one sister with DVT history at age 54.   Recent History: Ms. Gonzales recalled a recent long flight (12 hours) from Spain  approximately 3 days ago  where she reports prolonged sitting with minimal movement.   Presentation: On physical examination  Ms. Gonzales was tachycardic (Heart Rate: 110 beats/min) and tachypneic (Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min). Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air  Blood Pressure 140/90  and she appeared anxious and mildly diaphoretic. Auscultation of her chest revealed normal breath sounds bilaterally.  Suspected Diagnosis: Based on clinical signs & symptoms  recent history of a long flight  and her past medical history of DVT  she is suspected to have an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  This clinical presentation is a common representation of Acute PE. The patient's previous history of DVT and hypertension increases her risk of developing a PE. Moreover  her recent history of prolonged immobility during a long flight could possibly act as a trigger event for the same.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,88,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile:  Mrs. Jones is a 65-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms suggestive of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). Her demographic profile is consistent with epidemiological ranges indicating that pulmonary embolism is more common in older adults (over 60 years of age) and slightly more prevalent among females.  Past Medical History:   Of relevance to her current condition  Mrs. Jones has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was put on anticoagulant therapy 5 years ago following her DVT diagnosis and was recommended lifestyle modifications including dietary changes and cessation of smoking. She also has a controlled history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which have been managed with medication and lifestyle amendments. She is a former smoker  having quit about 6 years ago after a pack-a-day smoking habit for over 30 years. She also has occasional  mild asthma triggered by allergens. There is no known history of malignancy or recent surgeries.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Jones presents with sudden onset  sharp  stabbing chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  mild dizziness  occasional bouts of coughing  and low-grade fever. She also reported experiencing mild swelling and tenderness in her right calf.   Examination:  She is currently hemodynamically stable  although slightly tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute; her blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg  and her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. On chest auscultation  breath sounds appeared faint with expiratory wheezing. She has a BMI of 29 which is in the overweight range.  Conclusion:  Given Mrs. Jones' presenting complaints  medical history of DVT  risk factors including her age  female gender  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  and smoking history  acute pulmonary embolism is a high-priority differential diagnosis. Her symptoms of unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  and signs of DVT support this possibility. Immediate diagnostic tests including D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiography and lower limb ultrasonography for DVT detection should be prioritized and anticoagulation therapy should be initiated after confirming the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,89,Presentation Title: Acute Pulinary Embolism: A Case Study  Patient Profile: Patient X  a 65-year-old African American female with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32  is the subject of our case presentation today. Data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health indicates that this demographic group is 30% more likely to be obese  which consequently increases the risk of developing thromboembolic diseases.   Past Medical History: Our patient has a significant medical history that includes hypertension  diagnosed at age 45  type II diabetes mellitus  diagnosed at age 50  and chronic kidney disease (stage 3)  diagnosed at age 60. She experienced a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  following a total hip replacement surgery. She has been on anticoagulant therapy since her DVT but reported inconsistent use of her medication  particularly Warfarin.  Recent Clinical Presentation: Several studies  including those published in the New England Journal of Medicine  underline the increased likelihood of pulmonary embolisms amongst individuals with previous DVT episodes - particularly inconsistent anticoagulant medication use.  Recently  the patient presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens upon deep breaths  and light-headedness. An elevated heart rate was also noted. These clinical presentations are typical  as found in literature  as per the Mayo Clinic.  In conclusion  patient X represents a characteristic case of an individual at high risk of developing acute pulmonary embolism. Her past medical history  demographic profile  and recent clinical presentations are in alignment with published literature. This case thus serves as a reminder of the importance of consistently managing risk factors  adherence to anticoagulant medication regimens for patients with a history of DVT  and the need for improved awareness about PE symptoms among high-risk populations.

He resides in a suburban area of Detroit  Michigan  living with his wife. He is a retired military officer and is currently a chain smoker with a 44 pack-year history of smoking.   Medical History: He has a known medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after a knee replacement surgery 5 years ago. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with Metformin. He had a 10-lb unintentional weight loss over the past year.   His family history reveals a father who passed due to myocardial infarction and a sister currently under treatment for breast cancer. He denies any history of recreational drug use and consumes alcohol in moderation.  Current Presentation: Today  he complained of a sharp  stabbing chest pain primarily on the right side that worsens upon deep breaths. Moreover  he described having episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations. On examination  he appeared anxious  vital signs were notable for tachycardia (110 beats/min) and oxygen saturation of 88% on ambient air. Upon auscultation  his lungs demonstrated decreased breath sounds on the right side.  Physical examination reveals swollen  tender right calf suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. The rest of his examination is non-contributory. Given his symptoms  medical history  especially of past DVT  current physical findings  and substantial smoking history  an acute pulmonary embolism is suspected.  Investigations: A D-Dimer test  Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)  and lower extremity Doppler ultrasound are planned to be conducted for confirmation and evaluation of the extent of the disease. In view of his significant hypoxia and tachycardia  he has been started on supplemental oxygen and anticoagulation therapy in the meantime as a life-saving measure.  Future Planning: The patient will require close monitoring in an intensive care unit considering the grave nature of this condition. Smoking cessation  dietary changes  and initiation of an exercise regimen will be essential in his management plan in the long term. This case will involve a multidisciplinary team  including Pulmonologists  Cardiologists  and Hematologists for optimum care.   End of Presentation.

Family and Social History:  Mrs. Jones lives alone. She has two grown children living out of state. Her husband passed away 5 years ago due to a heart attack. There is a family history of deep vein thrombosis  as her mother also experienced it after a major surgery.   Review of Systems:  Cardiovascular: Hypertension   Respiratory: Shortness of breath  chest pain   Endocrine: Hypothyroidism   Musculoskeletal: History of arthritis  bilateral knee replacement  Demographics and Risk Factors:  Demographically speaking  pulmonary embolism  just like deep vein thrombosis  is common in elderly populations with a slightly higher prevalence in women  particularly in the sixth decade of life. Major surgeries  including orthopedic surgeries like knee arthroplasty  may predispose patients to thrombotic events. Other risk factors that fit the profile of Mrs. Jones are a history of deep vein thrombosis  immobilization  and prolonged bed rest  all contributing to a high risk of pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion:  This presentation discussed the clinical findings and patient history suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism  which should be verified through appropriate diagnostic tests. The profile of Mrs. Jones  alongside her risk factors  may help healthcare providers in better understanding and managing her case. Appropriate treatment and interventions should be promptly initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,94,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: Mr. James Martin  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath which started a few hours ago. He reports a sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  pointing towards his left chest. The pain is described as sharp  intermittently severe  and aggravated by deep breathing. He also noted feeling light-headed and that he sweated excessively  but he denies having any episode of unconsciousness.  He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. His medical history includes hypertension  which has been well controlled on medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). He has no known drug allergies. His family history disclosed that his older sister suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post her hip surgery two years ago.   Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  Mr. Martin appears short of breath and anxious. His pulse (110 bpm) and respirations (24/minute) are rapid. Blood pressure is on the lower side at 110/70 mmHg and his SpO2 is at 88% on room air. His chest examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side  where he points to the pain. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.  Assessment: Based on the symptoms  medical and family history  and the physical examination  Mr. Martin is likely suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The hypertension could also have contributed to the increased risk.   Follow-up: Mr. Martin is immediately given supplemental oxygen to improve his oxygen saturation. D-dimer test  arterial blood gas analysis  electrocardiogram  and chest CT angiogram are ordered. As PE can have possible fatal outcome  a prompt diagnosis and treatment plan is crucial. Bridge anticoagulant therapy will be initiated in the interim period before confirming the diagnosis with imaging tests.  Conclusion: Acute Pulmonary Embolism is a potentially lethal condition that necessitates immediate attention  diagnosis  and treatment. Our patient  Mr. James Martin  is currently in this critical phase and needs to be managed promptly and appropriately to prevent any fatal sequela like right heart failure or sudden death. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,95,Subject: Patient Presentation – Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 60 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents today with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain and a bit of dizziness. He reports the shortness of breath becoming severe over a period of few hours along with an increased heart rate. Postural hypotension was also observed. His oxygen saturation level on pulse oximeter was found to be 88%  lower than the normal range.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from 5 years ago. He also has been dealing with hypertension for over 10 years and Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years. In addition  he was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2 years ago  for which he underwent chemotherapy.   Risk Factors:  Given his age  previous medical history of DVT and malignancy  and current complaint of sudden onset of breathing difficulty and chest pain  Mr. Doe is at high risk for acute pulmonary embolism. His sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and smoking habit are additional risk factors.  Discussion:  In the U.S  60-100 out of 100 000 Caucasians are affected by PE annually  with incidence increasing with age. Historically  males have been thought to have a slightly higher incidence rate  especially those with a history of VTE. Chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes  which Mr. Doe suffers from  have shown increased risk towards the PE. Cancer patients like Mr. Doe  due to their elevated coagulation activity  have a four- to sevenfold increase in the incidence of PE. His sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and smoking habit further complicates his health condition.   In conclusion  with his current clinical presentation and history  Mr. Doe exhibits several multi-factorial PE risk. Immediate diagnostic measures and therapy are crucial to ensure a positive prognosis.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,97,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Patient Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient: Mr. Robert Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents with sudden intense chest pain  difficulty breathing  and a dry cough. He is a non-smoker.  Slide 2: Demographics  According to literature  pulmonary embolism (PE) is more common in the older population  with a median age at diagnosis around 66 years. Approximately 51% of the diagnosed patients are men  and Caucasian individuals are at a higher risk  hence our patient fits into this demographic description.  Slide 3: Clinical Presentation  Upon physical examination  Mr. Johnson is found to have a rapid heart rate and low blood oxygen levels. His blood pressure is slightly elevated. These are common signs noted in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 4: Medical History  Mr. Johnson has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has been taking anticoagulants. Other medical conditions include Type II diabetes and hypertension. He underwent hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. History of DVT  recent surgery  and prolonged immobilization due to recovery post-surgery are risk factors associated with pulmonary embolism.  Slide 5: Current Scenario & Diagnosis  A CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered and confirmed the presence of a large clot obstructing the right pulmonary artery. Other diagnostic tests include D-dimer test and venous Doppler ultrasound of legs  which further confirm the PE diagnosis.  Slide 6: Risk Factors & Epidemiology  Common risk factors for PE include prolonged immobilization  recent surgery  active cancer  pregnancy or postpartum status  and use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Our patient has been overrepresented with three risk factors – DVT history  recent surgery  and prolonged immobilization.  Slide 7: Conclusion   Mr. Robert Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a previous DVT  falls into the demographic most likely to suffer from a PE. His recent hip surgery and associated prolonged immobilization further increased his risk. The swift diagnosis and management will improve prognosis and decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this serious condition.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,98,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian female.  Demographics: The patient resides in an urban area and works as a secretary. She is average weight  an ex-smoker with 15-pack years history  and has a limited physical activity level due to her desk job and sedentary lifestyle. She reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Condition: The patient reports sudden onset of shortness of breath  excessive sweating  chest pain radiating to her back  and a feeling of 'impending doom'. She denies recent surgeries  traumatism  or prolonged immobilization.  Past Medical History: She has a known history of hypertension and has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus for which she is prescribed metformin. She also has a family history for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is no noted history of heart diseases  lung diseases or kidney conditions.  Current Medications: She is regularly taking Metformin for her Type II Diabetes and Lisinopril for Hypertension. She is not on any form of anticoagulants or steroids.   Hospital Course:  Upon arrival at the emergency department  she was tachycardic and hypoxic. Labs showed troponin elevation  a D-dimer test was ordered which came back positive. CT Pulmonary angiography showed clots in her left pulmonary artery branches  making a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Management was initiated with anticoagulation therapy and the patient was admitted for close monitoring of her vitals and symptoms.   Conclusion: This patient's sedentary lifestyle  advanced age  family history  female sex  and chronic controllable diseases like hypertension and diabetes puts her at a substantial risk for the development of venous thromboembolism. Immediate intervention was provided upon presentation of symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease and lifestyle modifications are recommended for long-term management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,99,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. John Davis  a 68-year-old African-American male  arrived in the Emergency Department today. He is a retired industrial worker from Baltimore  Maryland  who lives alone. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and moderate alcohol consumption. Overweight at 210 pounds (BMI of 29)  he was diagnosed with high blood pressure and high cholesterol 10 years ago. He has been on medication for both conditions with reasonable control noted.   Presenting Condition: Mr. Davis is presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath which started approximately three hours ago. He has also complained of sharp  stabbing chest pain upon deep inhalation and a dry cough. He mentioned feeling lightheaded and mentioned brief episodes of dizziness over the course of the day. His vitals on admission were: HR of 105 bpm  BP of 145/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. No fever was noted.  Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. Davis has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower leg about five years ago following surgery for a hernia  for which he was treated with an anticoagulant. He also has a documented history of intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib) dating back two years for which he has not been treated with anticoagulant therapy due to his reluctance regarding the risk of bleeding. Additionally  his record shows past occurrences of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with normal neurologic exams between episodes. He has been chronically managed with aspirin for this condition.  Given the patient's sudden onset of symptoms  his history of DVT  and risk factors including smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and AFib  there is a high suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism.  Note: Pulmonary embolism most often affects adults older than 60 years  though it can occur at any age. Obesity  hypertension  and certain pre-existing conditions such as deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation can increase the risk. According to multiple studies  Pulmonary embolism is reported to be more prevalent among African-American individuals than among other ethnicities. Obesity is also a significant risk factor for PE. Untreated AFib and prior history of DVT enhances the risk of PE to a significant extent.   Reference: Horlander KT  Mannino DM  Leeper KV.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,1,100,"Title: A Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Presentation:   Mrs. Jones is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who currently resides in Boston  Massachusetts. She is retired and has a physical activity level of less than 3 hours a week. Mrs. Jones has presented to the emergency department  reporting the sudden onset of dyspnea  palpitations  chest discomfort  and lightheadedness that started just a few hours ago. She denies recent falls  traumas  or infections.  Medical History:  Mrs. Jones's past medical history is significant for obesity with a BMI of 31. She reports that she has a sedentary lifestyle and is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history  albeit she quit smoking 10 years ago. Mrs. Jones has a history of congestive heart failure diagnosed five years ago  and she was put on Lasix and ACE inhibitors since.   She also suffers from uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  managed on hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. She had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a total knee replacement surgery three years ago  for which she was anticoagulated temporarily.   Living Situation and Support:  Mrs. Jones lives alone in her apartment since her husband passed away two years ago. Her son and daughter live out of town  but they are in regular touch  and her son visits every few months. She has a caregiver who visits her twice a week to assist with groceries  cooking  and cleaning.  Review of Systems:  The cardiovascular review reveals slight edema in her lower limbs but no visible varicosities. Her lungs sound clear  but the breathing rate is slightly increased. She rates her chest discomfort as a 6 on a scale of 10  describing it as """"sudden  felt like pressure and quite scary."""" Her blood pressure is 148/92 mm Hg  which is high  and her O2 saturation is at 94%. She also presents with mild anxiety.    Given her symptoms and history of previous DVT  the possibility of an acute pulmonary embolism is high on the differential diagnosis list  posing a significant risk given her cardiovascular and thrombosis histories.   This format for presenting a patient's history should provide healthcare professionals with a comprehensive overview of the individual's current health status and pre-existing conditions  ultimately leading to more accurate diagnosis and treatment strategies."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,1,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 62-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency room with acute onset of sudden  sharp  right-sided chest pain which he describes as “stabbing” in nature. He endorses shortness of breath at rest significantly worse over the past 2-3 hours. There is associated lightheadedness with no associated chest pressure  nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. He denies recent travel  falls  surgery or immobility.   Vital Signs: BP 130/80 mmHg  HR 115 bpm  Temperature 98.2°F  Respiration 20 bpm  O2 Saturation 93% on room air  Patient’s relevant past medical history includes hypertension which is well controlled on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. He has no known history of venous thromboembolism but has an older brother who was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism five years ago. He quit smoking 5 years ago  after a 20-year-long pack/day habit. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle and works as a software engineer.   This presentation is consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism which should be urgently evaluated with appropriate imaging studies. Current literature suggests African Americans have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism incidents including pulmonary embolism compared with individuals of European descent. Mr. Johnson's age  sedentary lifestyle  and family history also increase his risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,2,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Reeves  a 68-year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 3 years ago  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath that started a couple of hours prior. She rates it as 8 on a 10-point scale and states the dyspnea is associated with a sharp chest pain that is exacerbated by deep breathing. She has also reported light-headedness  but no syncope  no palpitations  no cough  no fever  no sputum production.  She is a non-smoker and denies any recreational drug use. Her medications include Lisinopril  Atorvastatin  and a daily aspirin  as ordered after her DVT. She admits to being non-compliant with her medications recently as a result of difficulty in affording them. There is no family history of clotting disorders.  On physical examination  she is anxious  diaphoretic  and in obvious respiratory distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  heart rate of 112 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  temperature 37.1°C  and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Pulmonary examination reveals tachypnea without wheezing  crackles  or other abnormal lung sounds. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia  without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lower limb examination shows mild edema but no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  This presentation  along with her relevant past medical history and risk factors  raises a suspicion of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Immediately  the necessary steps are taken to stabilize the patient and proceed with further investigations to confirm the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,3,Patient Presentation:   A 68-year-old African American woman presents to the emergency department with the primary complaint of severe dyspnea and chest pain that began suddenly earlier in the day. The pain is sharp  localized in the central chest  and gets worse with deep inhalation. Her medical history consists of a recent total knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She is a former smoker  having quit 7 years ago. Family history reveals her mother died from a stroke in her early seventies. She lives with her husband and is retired.  Vital signs reveal respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 155/90 mm Hg  heart rate of 102 beats per minute  oxygen saturation of 93% on room air at rest. She exhibits signs of anxiety related to her breathlessness. Her BMI is 30.3 kg/m^2 indicating obesity. She confirms that she is adherent to her hypertension and hyperlipidemia medications.  On physical examination  there is slight tachypnea and tachycardia. The chest examination showed reduced breath sounds in the lower right lobe of the lung and over the left lung field as well. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   The clinician’s impression based on the patient’s symptoms  clinical findings  and recent surgery is a possible acute pulmonary embolism. Follow-up investigations including D-dimer assay  chest CT scan  and echocardiogram are planned.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,4,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jane Doe  a 58-year-old African American woman  presents to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that is aggravated by inspiration and dry cough that started about 3 hours ago. She reports that these symptoms began suddenly while she was resting at home. She is a non-smoker but her father and two uncles died of heart disease in their sixties. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 29 indicating she is overweight.   In addition to her family history of heart disease  her past medical history includes hypertension managed with Hydrochlorothiazide  warfarin for chronic atrial fibrillation  and a sedentary lifestyle. She has no known drug allergies but has a history of deep venous thrombosis following a hip replacement surgery 6 years ago.   Work history reveals she is a retired teacher. She does not drink alcohol and is an occasional drinker at social events. She lives alone since the bereavement of her husband two years ago and uses public transport to travel because she does not drive. There's no history of recent prolonged travel or immobilization. Previous blood tests have negatively indicated any indication of bleeding or clotting disorders.  On physical examination  her vitals show slight tachycardia with heart rate of 110 bpm  regular rhythm  and blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg. The oxygen saturation level is at 88% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lower lobe. Rest of the examination is within normal limits.   This presentation suggests that the patient may be suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism  warranting further investigation and treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,5,A 45-year-old African-American female with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and obesity presents to the Emergency Department. The patient reports a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and chest pain which she characterizes as a sharp  stabbing pain worse during deep inhalation. She also states she has been experiencing lower limb swelling and a general feeling of unwell  including fatigue and mild fever for the past 4 days. With recent long-distance flight travel (approximately 10 days ago)  she denies any use of contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy but admits to a family history of DVT. She has been compliant with her DVT medications. She does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol. The patient acknowledges she does not participate in routine physical activity due to obesity-induced joint pain. No known drug allergies.  Upon further evaluation  physical examination shows an anxious  diaphoretic woman with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  pulse rate 101 beats per minute  blood pressure 110/70 mmHg  oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Tenderness and mild swelling are observed on the right lower limb. Cardiac exam is normal except for tachycardia without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung auscultation reveals good bilateral air entry  no wheezing  crackles  or reduced breath sounds on auscultation  and chest percussion is also normal. Abdominal  and neurological examinations are unremarkable.   Considering her symptoms  past medical history  and recent plane travel  the patient is suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism. Further investigations are urgently planned to confirm the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,6,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Atienza  a 52-year-old Filipino-American woman  with a BMI of 28  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness. The chest pain is sharp  worsens upon deep inspiration and has been persistent over the past 6 hours. She also reports lower limb edema particularly in her left calf  with associated feelings of warmth over the area  reaching over the past week. She mentions occasional palpitations and has noticed herself tiring more easily than usual.  Ms. Atienza has a past medical history significant for hypertension (controlled with Amlodipine 5mg daily)  and was recently immobilized following a minor ankle surgery 2 weeks prior. She was not prescribed any prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis at the time. Additionally  she is an ex-smoker and quit 10 years ago. She occasionally drinks socially  denies use of illicit drugs. Her family history reveals that her mother had a similar episode at her age  but she is uncertain of the diagnosis.  Upon examination  she appears distressed and anxious. Vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 110 bpm) and hypoxia (O2 Sat: 92% on room air). Her BP and body temperature are normal. Chest examination reveals tachypnea with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal  no murmurs heard. Her left calf is visibly swollen and tender on palpation compared to the right. Blood tests have been sent for D-Dimer  troponin level  and arterial blood gas analysis.   She is currently in the high-risk category for Pulmonary Embolism based on her Well's score and her symptoms suggest an acute presentation of pulmonary embolism. The medical team plans to confirm through imaging test - CT pulmonary angiography. She is potentially a candidate for anticoagulant therapy after the confirmation of the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,7,Patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations that started roughly two hours prior to arrival. The pain is sharp  localized to the middle of the chest  and increases with inspiration. She describes it as 7/10 in severity. She also reports experiencing a cough with some bloody sputum.

There's no record of similar cases in his family.   Currently his vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate at 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 143/92 mmHg  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  temperature is 98.6 F  and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Given Mr. Murphy’s sudden onset of symptoms with significant cardiovascular risk factors  a recent long-distance travel and history of DVT  acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Further examinations including D-dimer testing and imaging studies are planned.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,10,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Sanchez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and chest pain that started about 2 hours ago. The pain is sharp in nature  exacerbated by deep inhalation. She also mentions feeling lightheaded with an episode of near-syncope earlier today. She denies cough  fever  or any recent travel. She has no known exposure to COVID-19. She lives with her husband and brother  who both have been asymptomatic.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Ms. Sanchez has a long-standing history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. Approximately 5 years ago  she had a hysterectomy due to the presence of uterine fibroids. She had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg one year after her surgery. Despite being on anticoagulant therapy post-DVT  Ms. Sanchez confesses that she has been non-compliant with her medication for the past few months.  Family history is significant with both her mother and aunt having suffered from episodes of pulmonary embolisms. Ms. Sanchez has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. She drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use.  On physical examination  Ms. Sanchez appears anxious and in pain. She is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 89% room air. Pulse rate is 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg  and temperature is 98.6°F. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the left lower lobe. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. The patient's presentation and history raise a high clinical suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,11,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old African American male named Mr. James comes to the emergency department. He presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath that started earlier in the day  associated with a sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens upon deep breathing.   Mr. James has a significant past medical history for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes a daily dosage of Metformin and Lisinopril. He also has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around one year ago; he's been on anticoagulation therapy (Warfarin) since then but mentions that he's not been very compliant with his medication recently due to financial constraints.  He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history  and he also mentions about his recent road trip where he was sitting for over 8 hours continuously  around a week back. He admits that he has been feeling a slight pain in his right calf since the trip  but he dismissed it as nothing significant.  He lives with his wife in a suburban area. He is a retired engineer and has some occasional alcohol intake.  On physical examination  he appears to be anxious and in distress  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The right calf was slightly swollen with mild tenderness.  Given the history  physical findings  and given his risk factors of non-compliance to anticoagulation therapy  recent long journey  smoking  and known history of DVT  Mr. James is suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,12,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jones  a 65-year-old post-menopausal African American female  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  left sided chest pain which is pleuritic in nature  palpitations and light-headedness. She mentions her symptoms started approximately 3-4 hours ago while she was watching TV at home. She denies any associated symptoms like cough  fever  leg pain or swelling  known allergies or prior anaesthetic complications.   She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin respectively. She was found to have uterine fibroids and went under hysterectomy 4 weeks ago. As part of her family history  her mother suffered a deep vein thrombosis at the age of 62. She is an ex-smoker  having quit 25 years ago and denies any alcohol or recreational drug use. She is retired and lives with her husband.   On physical examination  she appears distressed but her vitals are stable with a pulse rate of 100 bpm  blood pressure of 130/90 mm of Hg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her physical examination is significant for tachypnea  tachycardia and decreased breath sounds on the left side.  The above presentation raises concern for an acute pulmonary embolism  likely secondary to her post-surgical state  further confirmed when a subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram showed an acute clot in the left main pulmonary artery. The patient was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,13,Patient Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian female  retired nurse.  Chief Complaint: Acute onset shortness of breath and sharp chest pain worsening with deep breaths.  History of presenting illness: The patient presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of dyspnea and sharp chest pain for the past 6 hours. The pain scores 7 out of 10 on the pain scale and reduces slightly to a 5 when the patient is lying still  but worsens when she takes deep breaths. She reports occasional dry cough and light-headedness during the past 6 hours  but no near-fainting or fainting episodes. She denies any recent trauma  prolonged immobilization  recent surgery  or known history of malignancy or inherited coagulopathy.  Past Medical History: Notably  the patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis in the left lower leg about 3 years prior that was treated with warfarin for 6 months. She also has well-controlled hypertension and type II diabetes. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2.  Medications: Currently on metformin and lisinopril. No known drug allergies.  Family History: Mother had a stroke at age 79. No known family history of coagulation disorders.  Physical Exam: The patient appears distressed and is breathing rapidly. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature: 37.8°C  Heart Rate: 110 beats/minute  Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/minute  Blood Pressure: 145/85 mmHg  Oxygen Saturation: 87% on room air. On auscultation  breath sounds are normally heard bilaterally and heart sounds are tachycardic with no additional sounds.  Based on the patient's presentation and medical history  the clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism is high. The respiratory symptoms  history of deep vein thrombosis  and risk factors such as obesity and age all contribute to the high suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Plan: The plan is for hospital admission  with immediate initiation of anticoagulation therapy if no contraindications are found. Further confirmatory diagnostics such as a CT pulmonary angiogram will be performed. This patient's condition will be managed in accordance with standard treatment guidelines for pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,14,"Patient Presentation: Mr. Johnathon King  a 67-year-old African American male presents to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset of chest pain and difficulty breathing which started around 2 hours ago. He describes the chest pain as """"sharp"""" and """"stabbing"""" in nature  worsened on deep breaths. He also complains of light-headedness but denies any history of associated fever  cough  sputum production  or hemoptysis. He denies any recent travel  surgery  or trauma. He also denies any recent episodes of prolonged immobilization.   Demographics:  Mr. King is a retired construction worker  is a 30 pack-year smoker  and has a BMI of 32  indicative of obesity. He lives with his wife and they have three adult children. He is moderately active  tending to his own garden and likes to take regular strolls around the neighborhood with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. King has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are being managed with medications i.e.  amlodipine 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 20 mg daily  respectively. Records also signify that the patient was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) around 5 years ago.  Relevant Family History: There is no family history of genetic/hematologic disorders but his father had a history of recurrent DVT and eventually died due to a massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE) at the age of 70.  This patient’s age  gender  race  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  smoking  previous history of DVT  and family history indicate his risk of having an acute pulmonary embolism. His presenting symptoms of sudden onset chest pain  difficulty in breathing  along with his past medical history and risk factors  are highly suggestive of an acute PE."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,15,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Jones is a 60-year-old Caucasian woman who arrived in the emergency department with her husband due to sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that started an hour before. She describes the pain as sharp and stabbing that gets worse when she takes deep breaths. She has also noticed that she has been more fatigued over the past week and that her legs have been swollen and tender to the touch for the past few days.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Jones has a past medical history of obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and had a left hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30-year history of smoking. She has a family history of deep vein thrombosis (her brother had a DVT in his late 40s). She has been adherent to her medications  including hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She reported taking her prescribed anticoagulant medication (enoxaparin) regularly for the two weeks following her hip surgery  but she stopped afterward.   Demographic Details:  Mrs. Jones is retired  lives with her husband in their own home  and has support from their two adult children who live nearby. She received her high school education and was a cashier for most of her working life. Her insurance is traditional Medicare with a supplemental Medigap policy.   These presenting symptoms and her past medical history  along with the recent hip surgery  raise a high suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,16,Patient Presentation:  A 61-year-old African American female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness that started two hours ago. She describes the chest pain as a sharp  severe type of pain that gets worse when she breathes deeply or coughs.   She reveals she has peripheral edema on her left lower limb which started five days ago. Over the last two weeks  she has noted increased fatigue  unintentional weight loss  and general malaise. She denies any prior episodes of such symptoms. She reports night sweats  though denies coughing  fever  hemoptysis  or symptoms suggestive of an infectious process. Her surgical history is significant for a total knee replacement operation performed on the same edematous leg 12 days ago.   Her past medical history includes hypertension  controlled with medications  and a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2 is noted  confirming obesity. She also has a history of smoking  having smoked 1 pack per day for the past 25 years but quit 3 years ago. She reports no known drug allergies.  She is retired  lives with her elderly husband  and doesn't engage in regular physical activities. Currently  she is on hydrochlorothiazide for her hypertension and a multivitamin daily.  The patient is visibly anxious and appears to be in moderate respiratory distress. Her blood pressure is 128/85 mmHg  heart rate is 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  temperature is 37.1 degrees Celsius  and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Her lung fields reveal tachypnea and her lower extremities show signs of deep vein thrombosis.   The case calls for immediate investigations and further management for the suspected acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,17,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jenkins  a 65-year-old postmenopausal African American woman  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness that started two hours ago. She describes the chest pain as sharp  localized at the middle of her chest  and worsens with deep breathing. She denies any fever  cough  or recent travel history. The patient looks anxious and is visibly diaphoretic.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Ms. Jenkins has a known past medical history of hypertension  obesity with a BMI of 31  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. All conditions are well-controlled with medications. She had undergone a total knee replacement surgery six weeks ago. Her family history is positive for heart disease in her mother and father. She denies any known allergies but is an active smoker with a 30 pack-year history and consumes alcohol only occasionally.  On physical examination  her blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg  heart rate is 110 beats/min  respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Her BMI is calculated to be 31. On auscultation  she has normal heart sounds with tachycardia and clear lung fields. Her lower extremities are swollen  with the left more than right and show signs of deep vein thrombosis.   Based on her symptoms  risk factors such as recent orthopedic surgery  obesity  smoking  and physical examination findings  a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Further diagnostic testing including D-dimer  computed tomography pulmonary angiography  and duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremities will be required to confirm the diagnosis.  Overall  Ms. Jenkins is considered high risk due to her advanced age  obesity  and recent surgery  which all predispose her to venous thromboembolism  including a pulmonary embolism. She also has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Her presentation is fairly typical for a patient with acute pulmonary embolism  including her symptoms of sudden shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  tachycardia  and lower extremity swelling indicating possible deep vein thrombosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,18,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Ramirez  a 62-year-old Hispanic female with a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  hypertension  and smoking  presents to the emergency department in acute respiratory distress. She complains of sudden onset shortness of breath over the past few hours  which has progressively worsened. She has also noticed pleuritic chest pain  localized mostly to the right side. She has also had episodes of coughing up blood-tinged sputum along with mild fever. Ms. Ramirez recalls a recent long-haul flight of more than 6 hours about a week before the symptoms began.  In addition to her relevant medical history of DVT  it's notable that Ms. Ramirez is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. She was prescribed an oral contraceptive for menopausal symptoms  which she's taken for the past few years. She admits to a 40-pack-year smoking history and is currently a smoker. There is no significant family history of clotting disorders.   Since her last DVT episode a decade ago  she has not taken regular anticoagulants  citing medication cost and her perception that the risk has decreased over time as reasons for non-compliance. She has not had a formal follow-up for her DVT in recent years.  This case is representative of typical demographic and risk factors associated with pulmonary embolism in literature  including older age  female sex  obesity  smoking  use of oral contraceptives  and a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,19,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain and light-headedness. His wife reports noticing him turning slightly blue on the lips and indistinct but visible red streaks on his legs for the past few weeks.   He has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a former smoker with a 40-year smoking history prior to quitting 5 years ago. He also has hypertension  managed with medication. He had a hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago and has been less mobile since then. Mr. Johnson does not have any known drug allergies.  He denied any recent fever  chills or sick contacts. No history of sudden loss of consciousness  cough or hemoptysis. He was compliant with all his medications but did not take any anticoagulation prophylaxis post-operatively.  On physical examination  he is sweaty with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. His BMI (body mass index) is 28.2  indicating he is overweight according to his height and weight. His jugular veins appear somewhat prominent and his respiratory exam shows decreased breath sounds on the right lower side of his chest with a prolonged expiratory phase. His lower extremities show bilateral  non-pitting edema with red streaks on the lower parts.  The differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism  myocardial infarction  pneumonia  COPD exacerbation  or aortic dissection.  Considering his recent hip surgery  immobility  and typical symptoms  acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Further diagnostic tests such as D-dimer  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and echocardiogram will be arranged.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,20,Patient Presentation:  John Shepard  a 66-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with an acute onset of shortness of breath that has been progressively worsening over the past few hours. He describes his breathlessness as severe and unlike any he has experienced previously  grading it at an 8/10 in terms of severity. The breathlessness is especially noticeable during exertion such as climbing the stairs. He also reports an associated pleuritic chest pain  a sharp  stabbing pain on the left side of his chest that intensifies on deep inhalation.   His past medical history is significant for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago  managed with anticoagulation therapy. He also has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed currently with Amlodipine and Simvastatin respectively.   He is a retired school teacher  lives with his wife  and has a 30 pack-year history of smoking  having quit about 15 years ago. On further questioning about his family history  he mentions that his mother had been diagnosed with recurrent DVT and his father died of a heart attack.   John does not have any known drug allergies and is currently only on his prescribed medications. He denies any recent surgery  prolonged immobilization  travel history  cough  hemoptysis  or leg swelling.   On physical examination  he is noted to be tachypneic and mildly tachycardic but maintaining his oxygen saturations on room air. His blood pressure is slightly elevated.   The clinical picture and history are concerning for a potential pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic workup is planned including a D-Dimer test and a CT angiogram  owing to his current symptoms and significant past medical history of DVT. He will be monitored closely in the emergency department awaiting these test results and further management plan.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,21,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Cruz is a 68-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and a 20-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day. He has been increasingly sedentary for the past six months due to work from home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. He presents today with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain that has been worsening over the past 24 hours. He mentions experiencing lightheadedness and palpitations but denies any recent leg swelling  trauma  cough  fever  or travel. The patient seems anxious and is visibly diaphoretic.  He is on oral hypoglycemics and antihypertensives  and is compliant with his medication regimen  but admits non-compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination. He has history of non-compliance with his DVT related medication regimen due to his concerns about bleeding side effects. He does not consume alcohol and his diet is moderately controlled with an occasional intake of high-cholesterol foods.  In the emergency room  his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 145/88 mmHg  heart rate 120 bpm  respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute  temperature 98.7°F  and oxygen saturation 89% on room air.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,44,Patient Presentation: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens on deep breathing. The patient's breathlessness started approximately 6 hours ago  and has been progressively worsening. She rates her pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. There is no history of trauma or injury prior to the onset of these symptoms and the patient denies experiencing cough  fever or palpitations. She also reports light-headedness but no syncope.   The woman has a past medical history significant for chronic atrial fibrillation for which she takes warfarin  but her recent INR is sub-therapeutic at 1.3. Other past medical history includes type 2 diabetes managed with oral hypoglycemics and hypertension controlled by enalapril. She also has a 10-pack year smoking history  having quit 15 years prior. She reports a sedentary lifestyle and a recent long-haul flight around 14 days ago. She has no known drug allergies.   Family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her sister. On examination  she is anxious  with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  pulse 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air.  Her symptoms  combined with her risk factors including her recent travel  sub-therapeutic INR  and family history of DVT suggest a high clinical probability for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,45,"Patient Presentation  Ms. Donna Jenkins  a 57-year-old African American woman  presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports that she woke up from sleep with an unusual tightness and pain in her chest  a sensation she describes as a """"heavy weight"""" on her chest. She also noted that this was accompanied by a sudden severe shortness of breath that was out of proportion with her usual baseline. She adds that she also experienced a brief episode of dizziness.  Past Medical History  Ms. Jenkins has a known diagnosis of obesity (BMI 33) and hypertension  which are usually well-controlled with antihypertensives and a controlled diet. She had total knee replacement surgery on her right knee four weeks ago. She reports no known allergies and is currently on Lisinopril 10mg once daily and a multivitamin. She does not smoke or consume alcohol and stays away from recreational drugs. Ms. Jenkins is regularly compliant with her medications and reports no recent travel or prolonged periods of immobilization.  Family history includes a sister who suffered a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) several years ago. She also reports that her mother had a 'heart attack' in her fifties  but no further information is available regarding this.   This presentation is suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism which can often relate to post-surgical state  obesity  family history of thrombotic events  and possibly  a race-related genetic predisposition to clotting disorders. Immediate diagnostic steps involving imaging studies and laboratory investigations are warranted in this case."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,46,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American man who presented with acute onset shortness of breath  which has been progressively worsening over the last 6 hours. He also reports sudden unexplained chest pain that's worse with deep breathing and a feeling of fainting. He has a history of being a heavy smoker since his early 20s. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago  and Type 2 diabetes  for which he takes Metformin daily. Additionally  he has a BMI of 30 classifying him as obese. He doesn't take any anticoagulants but regularly takes Aspirin for cardiac protection as prescribed by his doctor. He has not travelled recently or undergone any recent surgical procedures. His family history is significant with his father having died from a stroke at age 70.  This presentation is consistent with demographics observed in literature where Studies show that African Americans have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) which includes pulmonary embolism compared to other races. Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking and a previous history of DVT also represent significant risk factors for a PE. Other established risk factors for the disease include advanced age and underlying chronic conditions like diabetes. DNA historical safety concerns contribute to generally lower utilization of anticoagulants in the African American population.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,47,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African-American woman presents to the Emergency Department appearing slightly pale and in evident distress. Her main complaints are sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp  pleuritic chest pain that started approximately 6 hours ago. The patient also reports experiencing light-headedness  a faster heart rate  and a nagging cough that occasionally produces blood-tinged sputum.   The patient explains that she hasn't experienced any recent physical injury  nor any exertion that she hasn't accustomed to. She reveals that she recently travelled on a long haul flight.   Her past medical history is significant and includes hypertension  Type II diabetes  and a previous diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) some years ago  all of which are being managed effectively with medications. She also informs that she has been taking oral contraceptives for menopausal symptoms. She does not smoke but admits to drinking alcohol sparingly and is mostly sedentary  working as an office assistant.  Her records also show that she has a family history of blood clot disorders  with her father having passed away from pulmonary embolism.  On physical examination  she appears anxious  with a heart rate of 105/min  BP 155/95 mmHg  respiratory rate of 25/min  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.  Given this patient's risk factors including her age  long-distance travel  personal and family history of thrombotic diseases  hypertension  diabetes  use of oral contraceptives  and current symptoms presentation  she is likely suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,48,"Patient Presentation:   Mrs. Rita Johnson  a 60-year-old postmenopausal  African-American female presents to the Emergency Room. She works as a software engineer and lives with her husband. She states with urgency  """"I have been feeling short of breath and I don't know why."""" Mrs. Johnson has been experiencing dyspnea  chest pain  and a feeling of anxiety for the past few hours. She mentions a recent 12-hour flight trip from Africa to visit her grandchildren. She denies any recent trauma  surgeries  or use of oral contraceptives. She has a smoking history of 20 pack-years  quit 10 years ago. She also reports a family history of deep vein thrombosis in her mother. She has a medical history of controlled hypertension and is obese with a body mass index of 31 kg/m2.

Chest auscultation demonstrates clear bilateral breath sounds  no wheezing  crackles  or rhonchi. The remainder of the examinations  including cardiac and lower extremity  were normal.   Given her clinical presentation and risk factors: recent long-duration air travel  history of smoking  obesity  hypertension  and family history of thrombosis  a suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism is raised. Further diagnostic tests  such as a D-dimer test  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram  and/or pulmonary angiography  would be expedited to confirm the diagnosis."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,49,Patient Presentation:  Ms. S. Richardson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a previous medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a recent total knee replacement surgery 14 days prior  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath that has been progressively worsening over the past few hours.   She reports that she also experienced an episode of sharp  stabbing chest pain earlier in the day that intensified when she took deep breaths  prompting her to seek medical attention. She denies cough  fever  lower limb pain or swelling. Currently  she rates the pain a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10  and the discomfort is still present.  On further enquiry  she mentions that she lives alone  is retired  and is currently mobile using an aid. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol socially. She is non-compliant with her prescribed anticoagulant medication post-surgery due to concerns about side effects she read online.  On physical examination  she appears anxious and diaphoretic. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 94% on room air  and a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m². Pulmonary auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side.  Given her symptoms and risk factors  acute pulmonary embolism is a strong consideration  and further diagnostic workup will be carried out.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,50,Patient Presentation:  A 66-year-old African American female presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  which has exacerbated over the past few hours. The patient rates her breathlessness as an 8 out of 10  and it is accompanied by sharp anterior chest pain that intensifies with deep breathing. She denies any recent trauma  but mentions that she was on a six-hour flight about three days ago.   On examining her vitals  her blood pressure is mildly elevated at 150/90 mmHg  pulse is tachycardic at 110 bpm  respiratory rate is 22 per minute  oxygen saturation is reduced at 90% on room air  and she is afebrile. An ECG reveals a sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block and T wave inversion. Her legs are symmetrical without any signs of deep vein thrombosis.  In terms of past medical history  the patient has controlled hypertension and obesity (BMI: 32). She has a past history of hysterectomy and was on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms two years ago  which she stopped after a year. She has no known drug allergies. She quit smoking 15 years ago and is not an alcoholic. Her father died of a stroke at the age of 72.   Given the context of recent long-distance travel  her underlying risk factors including age  obesity  history of hormone therapy  and the acuteness and nature of her symptoms  there is a high suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic testing is warranted. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,51,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Annie Smith is a 65-year-old African-American female who presents to the emergency department complaining of acute onset shortness of breath that started 4 hours ago  accompanied by sharp  central chest pain that worsens upon deep inspiration. The pain does not radiate to her neck or arms. She reports feeling slightly lightheaded and confirms episodes of sudden unexplained sweating. She denies nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness.  She has a history of hypertension  well-controlled with amlodipine. She also has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 3 years prior  following a long flight  for which she was treated with blood thinners. She reports adherence to the treatment regimen at that time  but hasn't used blood thinners since she was told she could stop  about 2.5 years ago.  Currently  she doesn't smoke or use illicit drugs  drinks alcohol infrequently  and is moderately overweight. Her mother had a history of both pulmonary embolism (PE) and DVT.

Her physical exam is notable for mild tachycardia  decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung field  and slight leg swelling  more on the right than the left. CRT is less than 3 seconds.   Given her risk factors  clinical presentation  and examination findings  the physician suspects that Ms. Smith may have an acute pulmonary embolism (PE).
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,52,Patient Presentation: Mr. John Roberts  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that has worsened over the past several hours. Patient describes the chest pain as sharp  especially when taking a deep breath. His wife  who is present  reports that he appears paler than usual and seems anxious. He denied having a cough  hemoptysis  or fever. There is no leg swelling or calf pain reported.  Past Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  which was treated with anticoagulation therapy but has been non-compliant with his medications for the past year. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation  which is controlled with medication. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but had a 30-pack year smoking history prior to cessation. Mr. Roberts had a hip replacement surgery 2 months ago. His family history reveals that his mother passed away from a 'sudden heart attack ' but further details are not known.  Baseline vitals on arrival were unstable with a heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation levels at 90% on room air and blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg. Initial examination shows tachypnea  tachycardia  no jugular venous distension  and normal heart sounds but with decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung field. A slight leg swelling was noted when checked. Initial ECG shows sinus tachycardia but no other abnormal findings.  Considering Mr. Roberts's clinical presentation and past medical history  a high clinical suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism is being considered. Further diagnostic investigation and management will be prioritized urgently. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,53,"Patient Presentation:   Mrs. Clara Johnson  a 60-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain  and shortness of breath that started about 2 hours ago. She describes the chest pain as sharp  9 out of 10 in intensity  located on the right side  and gets worse with deep breaths. She denies any fever  cough  or sputum production.

The patient has a significant past medical history for hypertension  obesity (BMI 30)  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years prior. She underwent a total knee replacement five weeks ago. She admits to being less mobile since the operation  primarily since the last week  due to persistent pain in the knee. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. Her medications include Lisinopril for hypertension and she completed a course of Warfarin following her DVT incident.  Due to her clinical presentation and past medical history  an acute pulmonary embolism is suspected.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Gonzalez is a 58-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  obesity (BMI 31)  and hypertension. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. He presents to the emergency department with sudden shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. He also complains of sharp  chest pain that worsens upon deep breathing. He reports that the symptoms began while he was watching TV  without any obvious trigger. Mr. Gonzalez denies any recent surgery  prolonged immobilization or long trips that would have increased his risk for DVT recurrence. He is currently on Aspirin and Lisinopril but has not been compliant with his recommended compression stockings and anticoagulant therapy.  On examination  he appears restless and diaphoretic  with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His heart rate is 102 beats per minute and blood pressure is 128/82 mmHg. Chest examination reveals tachycardia with a normal S1 and S2  faint S3  and clear lung fields bilaterally.   Based on these symptoms  acute pulmonary embolism is strongly suspected. Further diagnostic investigations including D-Dimer  CT Pulmonary angiogram and possibly lower extremity venous doppler will be ordered for Mr. Gonzalez. He has several risk factors for pulmonary embolism including a history of DVT  obesity  and hypertension  accentuated by noncompliance with recommended compressive stockings and anticoagulant therapy. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,56,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  an ex-smoker who quit around 20 years ago and a retired truck driver. He presents to the emergency department today with primary complaints of sudden onset  unexplained shortness of breath and sharp chest pain which is worse on deep breathing. The symptoms started approximately 6 hours ago. He states that he has never experienced these symptoms before and is clearly anxious. The patient also reports a mild non-productive cough but denied any fever or recent signs of infections.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which he is on medication (Lisinopril)  and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) approximately 3 years ago  for which he was treated with warfarin. His family history reveals his father died due to myocardial infarction at age 72. He has no known drug allergies. His surgical history includes only a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. His social history includes occasional alcohol use with no history of illicit drug use. He lives with his wife and is partially dependent on his son for daily living activities.  On physical examination  the patient is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2  and appears restless due to dyspnea. Upon auscultation  breath sounds were found diminished with scant crackles at the right base. Also noted was mild tachycardia with a heart rate of about 100 bpm and mild hypertension  with blood pressure reading 150/90 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was suboptimal at 90% on room air.  These findings raise a strong suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism  given the patient's past history of DVT and current symptomatology. Further diagnostic testing  including a D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiography and echocardiogram would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,57,Patient Presentation  A 63-year-old African-American male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with inspiration  and coughing up small amounts of blood. The patient reports that the symptoms started with minimal exertion though rapidly intensified over a period of a few hours. He also complains of light-headedness  excessive sweating  and a feeling of apprehension.  In terms of social history  the patient is an ex-smoker  having stopped smoking around ten years ago  but admits to a 40-pack-year history. His BMI comes out to be 28.5  classifying him as overweight. He leads a sedentary lifestyle  working as a long-haul truck driver with minimal physical activity. He denies any illicit drug use or significant amount of alcohol consumption.   The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was also diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around five years ago after a prolonged truck driving trip. Although he was advised to wear compression stockings and maintain regular follow-ups  the patient expresses non-compliance with medical advice due to lack of health insurance. He did take warfarin for six months following the DVT diagnosis but discontinued it on his own.   Family history reveals that his mother had DVT and pulmonary embolism  and her sister suffered from recurrent DVT episodes. The patient isn't on any regular medications  and he denies any known allergies. Despite the known risks  the patient admits to having ignored his health  avoiding regular check-ups and missing vaccinations.   This presentation is consistent with acute pulmonary embolism  particularly considering his history of DVT  sedentary lifestyle  age  race  and family history of thromboembolic disease. Considering the sudden onset of symptoms  his past non-compliance  and family history  it would be urged to immediately initiate diagnostic testing treatment while educating the patient about the seriousness of his condition.

Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of a laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomy performed four weeks ago due to fibroids. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypertension for which she is on medication. The patient reports no allergies.   Social History:  She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives with her husband and is retired from work as a school teacher. Her mobility has been reduced recently due to the surgery and she has been leading a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the physical inactivity  her risk for a pulmonary embolism is increased due to the recent major surgery.   Family History:  Her family history is notable for deep vein thrombosis in her sister. The patient's BMI is 28 indicating overweight  adding to her risk factors for venous thromboembolism.  Clinical Examination:  Her vital signs on admission were as follows: Blood Pressure 130/85 mmHg  heart rate 108/minute  respiratory rate 22/minute  temperature 37.5°C  oxygen saturation 92% on room air. On physical examination  the patient appears diaphoretic and anxious. Auscultation of her lung fields reveals tachypnea. No evident leg swelling or tenderness noted.   The presenting symptoms and risk factors of the patient suggest a possible acute pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation with immediate imaging (CT pulmonary angiography) and lab tests including D-dimer are necessary.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,59,"Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath that started approximately 4 hours ago. He also mentions experiencing chest pain that specifically intensifies while taking deep breaths. He rates the pain as 7 on a scale of 1-10 and describes it as """"sharp"""" and """"stabbing"""". The patient also reports a feeling of light-headedness  but denies experiencing confusion  fever  cough or palpitations.  The patient mentions that he only recently returned from a long transatlantic flight which involved prolonged sitting. He reports no known allergies  but states he is currently taking antihypertensive medication for high blood pressure. He is a former smoker  having stopped smoking 5 years ago.   The patient's family history reveals that his older sister had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her early 60s. The patient's BMI is 32  indicating he is obese. His blood pressure on admission is 150/95 mmHg  pulse rate is 115 beats per minute and his oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.  The patient's past medical history consists of hypertension diagnosed 8 years ago and type 2 diabetes  diagnosed 10 years ago. Both conditions are generally well managed with medication. He does not remember the names of his medications but says he takes 3 pills daily for those conditions.  In summary  the patient is a 65-year-old African American male with hypertension  type 2 diabetes  obesity and a family history of DVT who presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain and light-headedness. His recent long-distance travel and overall medical history raise concerns for acute pulmonary embolism."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,60,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of shortness of breath  mild chest pain  and a feeling of light-headedness that began two hours prior to presentation. His history notes that he recently had a total hip replacement surgery four weeks prior. He traveled by car cross-country after the surgery.  The patient is noticeably short of breath at rest  diaphoretic  and appears anxious. His heart rate is 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation is 90% on room air  and he is afebrile.  Past medical history:  The patient had been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which were both controlled with medication. He is an ex-smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago. He doesn't have any known drug allergies.  Family history: The patient's father had a stroke at the age of 74  and his mother has hypertension. He has no siblings and his two children are healthy.   Social history: The patient lives with his wife in a suburban home. He is a retired engineer and denies any use of alcohol or illicit drugs.  The above well encapsulates a typical acute pulmonary embolism presentation at the emergency department of a hospital. This condition is common among the older age group and is often related to long periods of immobilization  recent surgery  or underlying coagulophathy. The patient’s recent surgery and travel likely contributed to his risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,61,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alfred Brooks is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency room complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and a dry cough. He also reports feeling lightheaded and weak  with an episode of fainting at home earlier in the day. Mr. Brooks also mentions experiencing bouts of rapid heart rate.  Mr. Brooks is a retired factory worker  who has a 30-pack-year smoking history. He underwent a total knee replacement 2 weeks ago and has been relatively sedentary since the operation. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and was diagnosed with stage 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) approximately eight years ago. He has no documented history of any cancers. His medications include ramipril  atorvastatin  and tiotropium bromide.  In 2015  he had an episode of deep vein thrombosis for which he was treated with anticoagulation therapy  but he has not been on any anticoagulants since that time. His family history reveals his mother suffered from recurrent DVTs and that his older brother had a pulmonary embolism six years ago. His wife reports that she has noticed his legs have been more swollen than usual over the past few days.   He denies any recent travel  chest trauma  upper limb DVT  or use of estrogen medication. He does not have any known allergies. He does not drink alcohol and has not used recreational drugs.   The emergency physician highly suspects an acute pulmonary embolism given Mr. Brook's clinical presentation  medical history  recent surgery  prolonged immobilization  and family history of thromboembolic diseases. He orders further diagnostic tests to confirm his suspicion.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,62,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Janet Smith  a 62-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and feeling of lightheadedness. She reports that the symptoms started about 2 hours ago while she was at home  sitting on the couch. She rates her pain as 7/10  describing it as a """"sharp  stabbing pain"""" in her chest that worsens with deep breaths.   She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication. She had a right total knee replacement surgery approximately 6 weeks ago. She does not smoke and she drinks alcohol socially. She has no known drug allergies.  Upon initial examination  her pulse is 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and the oxygen saturation is 92% on room air.  Further probe into her family history revealed that her sister had a deep vein thrombosis in the past. She admits to reduced physical activity since her recent knee surgery.   The combination of her symptoms  recent orthopedic surgery  and family history of thrombotic disease raises a high suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate management."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,63,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Gonzalez  a 65-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation and Factor V Leiden mutation  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports that the chest pain started suddenly approximately 2 hours prior to arrival  is pleuritic in nature  and rates it as 8 out of 10 in severity. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  or palpitations.  Her symptoms are associated with shortness of breath which is exacerbated on exertion. She denies having any cough  fever  or recent travel history. She admits non-compliance with her regular warfarin therapy due to financial constraints.  Ms. Gonzalez has a 10-pack-year smoking history and she quit 20 years ago. She additionally discloses a family history of deep vein thrombosis in her mother. She has no known allergies. Currently  she lives alone and has been mostly sedentary due to COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions.  On physical examination  Ms. Gonzalez appears short of breath and anxious. Respirations are labored. Vital signs are significant for tachypnea (22 breaths per minute) and tachycardia (Heart rate: 110 bpm). Lung examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lower lobe.  Considering her symptomatology  her non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy  along with her significant risk factors including her age  atrial fibrillation  Factor V Leiden mutation  and a strong family history of venous thromboembolism  an acute pulmonary embolism is highly suspected. Immediate diagnostic testing with a CT pulmonary angiogram is ordered.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Thompson  a 55-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens upon deep breathing  and light-headedness that started earlier this morning. Mr. Thompson has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a total knee arthroplasty surgery two years ago. He also suffers from obesity (BMI of 35) and hypertension  both controlled with medication. He does not smoke and rarely consumes alcohol. His other medications include Warfarin  initiated after his DVT  and Lisinopril for hypertension.  Upon scrutiny  the patient is noted to display signs of distress. His blood pressure is 110/70mmHg  heart rate is elevated at 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. He appears overweight. His pulmonary examination reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds on the right. His cardiovascular examination is unremarkable.   Given his history of DVT  ongoing anticoagulation  and the abrupt onset of his symptoms  the clinical suspicion for a pulmonary embolism is high. Immediate diagnostic evaluation for this life-threatening condition  including a CT pulmonary angiogram  D-dimer testing and EKG  is ordered. The patient is administered high-flow oxygen and his vitals are closely monitored. If confirmed  anticoagulation therapy (bridging with a parenteral anticoagulant  discontinuation of Warfarin and initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant) will be quickly escalated.   This case represents the average demographic and past medical history observed in many cases of acute pulmonary embolism. Patients with PE often have risk factors such as a history of DVT  surgeries  and hypertension  and may belong to demographic groups that have a higher prevalence of these factors. For instance  African Americans have been shown to have higher rates of hypertension.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,65,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Williams  a 65-year-old African-American female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that began approximately 45 hours ago. She describes her chest pain as non-radiating  sharp  and noticeable even with shallow breathing. Corresponding with the chest pain  she states she is experiencing shortness of breath even while at rest. She adds that these conditions have made it extremely difficult for her to complete her daily activities.   On further questioning  she admits to mild leg swelling and warmth on her left calf. She shows no symptoms suggestive of fever  palpitations  or lightheadedness  and there hasn't been any recent history of trauma.  Her past medical history reveals that she has been long-standing hypertension  obesity with a BMI of 32  and Type-2 diabetes mellitus. She also had a total left hip replacement surgery 1 month ago. She is a non-smoker and reports drinking socially. She has never had any similar symptoms in the past.  Her medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose Aspirin. She has been generally compliant with her medications but reports she might have missed a few doses in the past week. Family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis in her father.  Upon physical examination  she appears anxious  heart rate is elevated at 102 bpm  respiratory rate at 24 breaths/min with decreased breath sounds on the right side. Blood pressure is somewhat low at 105/68mmHg  and her left leg is noticeably more swollen than the right one. She has an oxygen saturation of 95% noted on room air.

The patient's oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals tachycardia and reduced breath sounds at the right lower lobe. Her extremities are warm with good peripheral pulses. There is slight swelling in the right calf in comparison to the left.  Preliminary findings suggest the patient may have a possible acute pulmonary embolism  significantly attributed by factors such as recent orthopedic surgery  immobilization  hypertension  obesity  and family history of DVT. Further testing  including D-dimer  arterial blood gas analysis  and advanced imaging like CT pulmonary angiography  has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,69,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is sharp  worse with deep inspiration  and radiates to his back. The patient describes the pain as 8/10 severity. Additionally  he notes that he has had some swelling and discomfort in his right lower leg for the past week  which he attributed to a strenuous day of gardening. He denies any cough  fever  trauma  or prior incidents like this.   Patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a sedentary lifestyle. He is a former smoker with 30 pack-years history but quit smoking 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol socially  denies any illicit drug use. His medications include lisinopril  atorvastatin  and a daily aspirin. He has no known drug allergies.  On examination  his blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg  pulse is 105 beats/min  respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min  temperature is 37 degrees Celsius  and oxygen saturation is 92% in room air. His BMI is 28. The rest of his physical examination is essentially normal except for minor swelling and tenderness in his right calf without erythema or warmth.  Given the typical symptoms and risk factors  the patient was suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate investigations were ordered and PE was confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiography. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy and monitored closely for the management of the PE.  This patient's presentation is consistent with the demographic that is most at risk for PE – i.e.  elderly  Caucasian  male  hypertensive  and sedentary lifestyle. Also  his prior smoking history could possibly have contributed to chronic lung disease  putting him at a higher risk.

On physical examination  her blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg  heart rate is 110 per minute  respiration rate is 24 per minute  and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Her chest examination reveals tachypnea and shallow respiration. Cardiovascular examination discloses tachycardia but is otherwise unremarkable. Lower extremity examination reveals swelling and tenderness on the post-surgical leg.   Given her recent surgery  non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy  and presenting symptoms  there is a strong clinical suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,81,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting with dyspnea  chest discomfort  and palpitations. She reports that these symptoms came on suddenly  while she was at home watching television. She describes the chest discomfort as """"a heavy weight """" located centrally  and the feeling worsened when she tried to take deep breaths. She denies any fever  cough  or other associated symptoms. She notes a history of prolonged travel as she recently returned from a long car trip from visiting her daughter in a different state two weeks ago.  The patient's past medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled on a regimen of lisinopril and atorvastatin. She also has a history of obesity  with a BMI of 30. Furthermore  she is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history  having quit five years ago. She also underwent a hysterectomy 20 years ago for reasons unrelated to cancer or bleeding disorders.  She reports adherence to her medication regimen and exhibits poor exercise tolerance due to her weight and general lack of physical fitness. Her family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis in her mother  who experienced multiple episodes in her late sixties.  On examination  her blood pressure is 130/86 mm Hg  heart rate 105 bpm  respiratory rate 22 bpm  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Notably  she appears anxious and mildly diaphoretic. Auscultation of the chest reveals tachycardia but is otherwise grossly normal  with no audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops  and clear breath sounds bilaterally. No leg swelling  redness  or warmth is noted.  This patient's demographic profile  symptoms  and clinical history are consistent with a potentially high pre-test probability for acute pulmonary embolism. The recent long car journey  prior history of hypertension  her age  her sex  her BMI and former smoking all contribute to this risk as per the literature. Immediate diagnostic testing and treatment should be considered."

She rates her pain as 8/10 and mentions that it has gradually been worsening over the past few hours. Her dyspnea is most notable with mild exertion  and she reports an episode of hemoptysis earlier today.   She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  atrial fibrillation for which she regularly takes a cardioselective beta blocker and a statin but is noncompliant with her prescribed oral anticoagulant due to fear of bleeding complications. She is a former smoker with a 20-pack year history but quit 15 years ago. She denies any history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  recent surgery or prolonged immobilization.  On physical examination  she appears anxious and diaphoretic with vital signs revealing a heart rate of 108 bpm  blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air.  This patient's age  race  and sex are consistent with studies showing that the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) increases with age  is slightly more common in females  and is highest among Caucasians. Her history of atrial fibrillation and non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy vastly increases her risk of developing a PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,89,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  retired truck driver and a veteran  presenting to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. The chest pain is pleuritic in nature  resolving with deep breathes. He has a medical history of hypertension  which is poorly controlled due to non-compliance with medication. His paternal history is significant as his father suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 55. Patient is a former smoker with 30 pack-years history but quit 10 years ago.   He was recently immobile for a prolonged period following a hip replacement surgery two weeks ago. He is not on any medication currently. Pertinent physical exam findings include tachycardia (HR: 110 bpm)  shortness of breath  decreased breath sounds on the right side  and a low-grade fever (38.2C). The patient also has a inserted Foley catheter due to his surgery and currently wearing anti-embolism stockings.   The patient's symptoms  personal medical history  and family history suggest an acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate tests and intervention are required. A D-dimer test  computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  and perhaps an ultrasound scan of the lower extremities to examine for DVT should be ordered as per the guidelines to support the diagnoses and start the appropriate management plan.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,90,Patient Introduction:  A 65-year-old African American female arrives in the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that started two hours ago. The patient also reported associated diaphoresis and a feeling of faintness.  Patient History:  The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension and obesity  with a BMI of 31. She also reports she is a former smoker  with a 20-pack-year history  having quit 10 years ago. She underwent total knee arthroplasty three weeks ago and has since been less mobile than usual. There is no known history of any malignancy.  Clinical Presentation:  On examination  the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs are remarkable for tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm  blood pressure of 142/86 mmHg  respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.  Risk Factors:  Obesity  recent major surgery (total knee arthroplasty)  and prolonged immobilisation are her risk factors for developing acute pulmonary embolism. Her age  previous history of hypertension  and prior tobacco use also potentially contribute to her risk.  This case presentation indicates a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism considering her symptoms and risk factors. Immediate diagnostic studies are warranted for confirmation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,91,"Patient Presentation  A 65-year-old African American woman presents to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and palpitations  which have increased in severity over the last few hours. She also notes associated chest pain  which she describes as a sharp  """"stabbing"""" sensation that worsens with deep breaths. She indicated that she had recent onset of right leg pain and swelling a week ago  but didn't seek medical attention for it. She denies any history of cough  hemoptysis  fevers  chills  recent surgeries  or prolonged immobilization.   Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and she reports that she is a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago.

Further investigation and immediate treatment are indicated."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,96,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that intensified when he tried to breathe deeply. On further interrogation  he reports experiencing intermittent lightheadedness and palpitations over the past few hours.  Mr. Johnson has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type-2 diabetes. He is an ex-smoker having quit 5 years ago but had a 30-pack year history prior to quitting. His medications include lisinopril and metformin. He had undergone total hip replacement surgery 6 weeks ago and had been largely sedentary since the operation. Family history is notable for deep vein thrombosis in his mother.  On physical examination  he appears anxious  diaphoretic and in respiratory distress. He is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 125/85 mmHg and saturating 94% on room air. There is no evidence of leg swelling or tenderness on palpation. However  cardiac examination reveals tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs. Lung auscultation showcases decreased breath sounds on the right side.  These findings suggest a strong suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism. The patient's advanced age  ethnicity  recent major surgery  and sedentary state post-surgery make him high-risk for a PE. This necessitates immediate confirmatory tests and initiation of life-saving treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,97,Patient Information: A 68-year-old African-American male  named John  with previous history of type II diabetes mellitus and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg 5 years ago  is presenting with acute onset of symptoms.  Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and chest discomfort  with a sudden onset.  History of Present Illness: John reports feeling well until approximately 2 hours ago  when he developed sudden onset of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The discomfort radiates to his back and is worsened by deep breathing. He has not experienced any associated symptoms such as cough  vomiting  or lower extremity swelling. His last episode of DVT was treated with anticoagulation therapy  but he confesses inconsistency in taking his prescribed medication.  Past Medical History: Alongside type II diabetes  John's medical history highlights DVT  hypertension  and obesity. His father had a myocardial infarction at a young age and died of ischemic heart disease.  Social History: John is a retired truck driver  confirming a sedentary lifestyle. He has been smoking about a half pack/day for the past 30 years. He denies any alcohol or drug use.  Review of Systems: General: No weight loss or night sweats. Cardiovascular: No history of palpitations  orthopnea  or ankle swelling. Respiratory: Shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal and urologic: No changes in bowel or urinary habits. Musculoskeletal: No joint pain or weakness. Neurologic: No headache  vision changes  or numbness.  Physical Examination: John is anxious  diaphoretic  and in obvious respiratory distress. His vitals reflect tachypnea  tachycardia  and a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. Pulmonary exam demonstrates tachypnea  with reduced breath sounds on the right side. His cardiovascular exam revealed rapid heart beats with no murmurs  gallops  or rubs. There is also mildly swollen and tender right calf  suggesting DVT recurrence.  Summary: This patient's sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain  history of prior DVT  and presence of many risk factors for thromboembolism (i.e. obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking) make pulmonary embolism a noteworthy differential diagnosis. Immediate diagnostic workup including D-Dimer  chest CT angiogram  and lower extremity Doppler is critical.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,98,Patient Presentation:  A 55-year-old African American woman presents to the emergency department expressing severe chest pain and sudden-onset breathlessness. She rates her chest pain at 8/10 and reports that the pain increased during deep inhalation. She also complains of feeling light-headed and has broken out into a clammy sweat.   She has a past medical history of right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed 2 years ago  for which she was treated with anticoagulants. She stopped the anticoagulation medication about 6 months ago after the episode of DVT resolved. She is a nonsmoker and has mild hypertension for which she takes medication  maintaining a normal blood pressure. The patient was overweight with a BMI of 30  putting her at low risk for obesity-related complications.   The patient also reports recent immobility due to a fractured ankle for which she had been wearing a cast for the past three weeks  indicating a possible risk for thrombus formation due to stasis. No history of travel or known malignancies.   Her family history is significant for cardiac problems; her mother suffered a stroke at the age of 60.   Given her history of DVT  recent immobilization  chest pain  and dyspnea on exertion  a preliminary diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is considered  prompting immediate further investigations.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,99,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old African American female presents to the ER with a chief complaint of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started 2 hours ago. She rates her pain at an 8 with pain character being sharp and localized on the right side of her chest. She mentions history of dyspnea on exertion from past 2 weeks. In addition to chest discomfort  she states having felt dizzy and light-headed.  Regarding her medical background  the patient has a known history of hypertension for 10 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 5 years  and she's obese with a BMI of 35. She had a knee replacement surgery 3 months ago and was immobile for an extended period post-operatively. She also admits to being a smoker for the past 15 years  with an approximate pack-year history of 30. She has family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   The patient's medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Clopidogrel. She also indicates that she doesn’t exercise regularly and her diet lacks consistency. She denies drug or alcohol abuse.  This female patient is presenting with symptoms that are strongly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism  considering her sharp  sudden chest pain and shortness of breath (particularly in the context of recent surgery  immobility and family history of DVT). She is also from the demographic most at risk. Her obesity  hypertension  diabetes  smoking habit  and recent immobility from surgery are key risk factors in this diagnosis. Further investigation is necessary for confirmation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,2,100,Patient Presentation:   A 70-year-old African American woman presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of acute onset dyspnea  chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. Subjective symptoms include moderate  constant  non-radiating chest pain  worse on deep inspiration  which started approximately 5 hours ago. She also mentions a recent increase in fatigue over the past week. She denies nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden mutation two years ago. She is currently on warfarin for anticoagulation  but her INR level is found to be sub-therapeutic today at 1.8. She admits failure to comply with her medication regularly due to financial constraints. She also has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She denies significant alcohol or recreational drug use but is a 30-pack year smoker.   Family History:  There is a positive family history of both venous thromboembolism and coronary artery disease. The patient's mother passed away from a stroke at the age of 72.  Lifestyle:  Patient lives alone in an apartment. She is a retiree and has limited physical activity  more so recently due to worsening fatigue.   On physical examination  her blood pressure is 148/90 mmHg  heart rate is 110 beats/min  respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min  temperature is 98.7°F  and O2 saturation is 89% on room air.   Overall  the patient's demographic details  symptoms and risk factors highly suggest a clinical presentation of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism.  Please note: Clinical decision-making should not be based solely on the patient's demographic data  but rather a combination of patient demographics  medical history  clinical presentation  physical examination findings  and correctly interpreted diagnostic tests.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,1,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Study of a Postoperative Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition typically characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath  chest pain  and hemoptysis. The presentation will be focused on a case review of a postoperative patient dealing with Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male  reflecting that PE is common among older adults  and the rates have been found to be slightly higher in African-Americans. The demographic data aids in understanding the nationwide susceptibility to the condition.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Patient has a history of Stage 2 colon cancer for which he had undergone surgical resection two weeks prior. He also suffers from hypertension controlled with medication  no history of anticoagulant use. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and has a BMI of 29  falling in the overweight category.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation The patient presented to the ER with acute onset of dyspnea  chest pain and tachycardia. He reported increased breathlessness over the past 48 hours with a sudden sharp right-sided chest pain. Low oxygen saturation (90%) was noted at initial evaluation.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Considering the postoperative state and clinical presentation  suspicion for PE was high. Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a clot in the right lower lobe of the lung  leading to a definitive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Slide 6: Treatment  The patient was initiated on intravenous unfractionated heparin. Due to his cancer history  he was considered at high risk of recurrent PE and therefore switched to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  which is better suited for cancer patients with PE.   Slide 7: Course and Outcome With initiation of anticoagulation therapy  patient's symptoms and oxygen saturation progressively improved. He was discharged from the hospital on a long-term LMWH plan and scheduled for regular follow-up  Slide 8: Conclusion This case underlines the importance of considering PE in postoperative patients presenting with acute onset dyspnea and chest pain. Health care providers must maintain a high index of suspicion for PE  especially in patients with potential risk factors such as cancer  hypertension and obesity.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,4,Title: A Study on Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female  Slide 1: Introduction - Acute Pulmonary Embolism is a common and occasionally fatal condition with variability in its clinical presentation  often leading to a delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis.  Slide 2: Demographics  - We present the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian female patient. It's noteworthy that according to the literature  Pulmonary Embolism might slightly predominate among middle-aged to elderly groups and Caucasians seem to carry higher risks compared to other ethnic groups.  Slide 3: Patient History - The patient has notable past medical records of smoking  obesity  and frequently extended periods of immobility due to her profession as a long-haul truck driver.  - The patient has a history of an oral contraceptive usage in her youth and a family history of thromboembolic disease. - All these factors significantly contribute to her heightened risk for Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 4: Recent Medical History - Two weeks prior to presenting symptoms  the patient underwent an arthroscopic knee surgery  serving as an additional risk factor for DVT/PE because of post-operative immobility.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation - The woman presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breathing  and feeling of light-headedness.  Slide 6: Diagnostics and Results - Her Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right bundle branch block  while her chest X-ray was unremarkable. A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 7: Management and Outcome - The patient was initiated on anticoagulant therapy and admitted to the hospital for monitoring. She responded well to the treatment with a resolution of her symptoms over the following days  being finally discharged in stable health condition.   Slide 8: Conclusion -The patient's lifestyle and postoperative state significantly contributed to her PE risk. This case underlines the importance of considering PE in differential diagnosis for at-risk patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. Moreover  it draws attention toward the necessitation of preventive strategies for PE in susceptible individuals.   Slide 9: Questions and Discussions - Open floor for questions and discussion.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,5,Title: A Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Slide 1: Introduction Our patient is a 60-year-old African-American female  recently diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  a condition where a blood clot develops in the arteries of the lungs  potentially causing serious damage if not diagnosed and treated early.   Slide 2: Demographics  Research indicates that Pulmonary Embolisms occur more in older populations  with median age of diagnosis being around 60 years. It may occur slightly more often in females  and African-Americans are at a higher risk.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  Our patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain and a cough that had been on-going for 2 days. Her oxygen saturation was found to be low on arrival.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Notably  our patient has a history of hypertension and obesity  which are known risk factors for Pulmonary Embolism. She has also been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for her menopause symptoms for the last six years  which recent studies suggest can marginally increase the risk of PE.   Slide 5: Inciting Event & Diagnosis  This patient was sedentary most time following a minor ankle sprain 2 weeks ago. After radiologic tests  a ventilation-perfusion scan was conducted  which confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.   Slide 6: Additional Relevant Information  It's worth noting that our patient is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies. She also has no familial history of blood clots.   Slide 7: Treatment & Prognosis Our patient was immediately started on Anticoagulant Therapy with Eliquis (Apixaban). Cautious monitoring of vitals  and oxygen supplication was maintained in her intensive care regime  to excellent effect.   Slide 8: Case Synopsis This case underscores the importance of taking a thorough patient history  understanding the risk factors and maintaining a high index of suspicion for Pulmonary Embolism  especially in patients presenting with seemingly non-specific symptoms like sudden shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation. Early detection and swift intervention is crucial in managing this potentially dangerous condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,6,"Title: Acute Pulolginary Embolism: A Patient Case Review   Slide 1: Introduction - Brief explanation on what Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) is – blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs  typically due to blood clots that travel to the lungs from the legs or  rarely  other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Portrait of """"Patient X"""": 65-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female  overweight  regular smoker with a 30-year history. - Resides in a small suburban area  leading a moderately sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - History of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episodes and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). - Known hypertensive for last 10 years managed with medication. - Non-Insulin dependent Diabetic for 5 years. - No known allergies.  Slide 4: Presentation  - Patient X presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset shortness of breath  mild chest discomfort and feeling faint. - No recent surgery or long-travel history.  Slide 5: Examination and Investigations - Tachycardic with pulse rate around 110 beats/min  elevated blood pressure. - Oxygen saturation levels were decreased on room air. - Imaging (such as CT Pulmonary Angiogram) and Lab tests (D-dimer  Troponin I) results reinforced the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment - Immediate administration of anticoagulants (like Heparin). - Long term plan: life style modifications for weight loss  smoking cessation  and control of diabetes and hypertension.  Slide 7: Key Points  - The importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of Acute Pulmonary Embolism. - Importance of a detailed medical history and understanding of risk factors for accurate diagnosis. - Urgent need for treatment initiation to prevent fatal complications.   Note: This case represents the common demographic and presentation of APE as suggested in the literature. Females  especially postmenopausal using estrogen replacement therapy carry a higher risk. Similarly  obesity  history of DVT  and smoking also contribute significantly to the risk factor pool."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,7,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Patient Profile: 65-year-old Caucasian female  Slide 2: Demographics and Prevalence According to statistics  pulmonary embolism (PE) affects approximately 60 out of every 100 000 Caucasians. Among patients over 60 years old  acute PE is increasingly common. Women are slightly more likely to be affected than men  particularly postmenopausal women.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a history of Factor V Leiden mutation  significantly increasing her risk for developing blood clots. She also has hypertension  and she is both obese and a former smoker – all risk factors for PE.   Slide 4: Recent History One week prior to admission  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery  which is known to further increase the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has been immobile post-surgery which again raised her risk level.  Slide 5: Symptoms and Presentation She presented with a sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath  chest pain  and a fast heartbeat. Intermittent dizziness was also reported.   Slide 6: Diagnosis On examination  she was found slightly cyanotic with low blood oxygen levels and tachypnea. The D-dimer test came back positive  and an electrocardiogram displayed signs of right ventricle strain. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE.  Slide 7: Management  Immediate anticoagulation therapy was initiated with low molecular weight heparin. After stabilizing the patient's condition  long-term anticoagulant  warfarin was prescribed to hold the progression and prevent new clots.  Slide 8: Conclusion PE is a serious pathological condition that can potentially lead to fatal complications if not diagnosed promptly and managed effectively. In our patient with multiple risk factors like age  genetic predisposition  obesity  recent surgery  and past smoking habits  a high index of suspicion was maintained which led to the quick diagnosis and management of PE. She will continue follow-up visits post-discharge to monitor her recovery and adjust her therapy as needed. For such patients  a comprehensive plan involving lifestyle modifications is also necessary to reduce future risk.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,10,Title: A Case of Acute Pulinary Embolism  Slide 1: Introduction A 50-year-old non-Hispanic white male presents with symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Epidemiological data suggests that the incidence of PE is highest among non-Hispanic whites  affecting up to 111 per 100 000 persons.  Slide 2: Demographics  Demographics can play a significant role in the risk and development of pulmonary embolism. Our patient falls into the age group (45-64 years) where the incidence of PE notably increases.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a past medical history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is a long-term smoker. Recent studies suggest that a previous VTE and smoking are significant risk factors for PE. He is also overweight – another risk factor  as obesity may contribute to venous stasis.  Slide 4: Presentation  The patient presents with acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain and a rapid heart rate. These are common symptoms of a PE that occur due to blockage in the lung arteries.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Measures  The diagnosis was confirmed with a combination of clinical probability assessment tool (Wells criteria)  D-dimer test and Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which have been shown to be highly effective in diagnosing acute PE.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment The patient was started on a therapeutic regimen including anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) initially followed by Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs).   Slide 7: Prognosis  The early implementation of this therapeutic strategy has been correlated with a reduced recurrence of VTE and improved overall survival rates conditionally.  Slide 8: Follow-Up & Conclusion  The Patient Education was essential to ensure adherence to the prescribed treatment and lifestyle modifications. This presentation emphasizes the essential role vigilant monitoring and management of risk factors play in preventing severe conditions such as PE.   Slide 9: Key Learning  This case report highlights the importance of considering demographic characteristics  past medical history  and current symptoms when diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. Early detection through clinical suspicion enabled rapid intervention  thereby improving patient outcomes.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,12,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female Patient  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian female. As per literature  acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is indeed more prevalent in Caucasians and the risk increases with age.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient's medical history is significant for obesity  current active smoking status  recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  and a sedentary lifestyle. The patient has not undergone any recent surgical procedures typically associated with PE.  Slide 4: Relevant Statistics  Each of these risk factors individually contributes to a heightened risk of PE. Obesity has been shown to increase the risk of PE by 2.21 times while active smoking can increase the risk by 1.3–2.4 times. A history of DVT raises the risk of subsequent PE threefold.  Slide 5: Patient Presentation  Presented with acute onset dyspnea  chest pain  and palpitations. Also noticed lower extremity edema. No blood coughing.  Slide 6: Clinical Findings  Examination showed tachypnea and tachycardia. Lower extremity exam was positive for left calf tenderness and edema  suggestive of DVT.  Slide 7: Investigations  D-dimer was significantly elevated. An urgent CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE. Echocardiography showed right ventricular strain suggesting a large embolus.  Slide 8: Management  The patient was started on therapeutic anticoagulation as per guidelines and admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.   Slide 9: Discussion  Discuss the relevance of risk factors of our patient in developing PE. Critically analyze the management plan.  Slide 10: Conclusion  Early recognition and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism is crucial as PE is a preventable cause of death in hospitalized patients. Managing risk factors is a key preventive strategy.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,24,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: An Adult Patient Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction Our focus is an adult patient presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolism affects approximately 60 per 100 000 persons per year globally  with higher rates in individuals over 70 years of age.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr.M  is a 75-year-old African-American male  living a sedentary lifestyle due to his current retirement status. Demographically  PE tends to occur more frequently in the older population  and some studies suggest a marginal predominance in males. African-Americans are reported to have a slightly higher incidence of PE than Caucasians.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr.M has a past medical history significant for hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are well-controlled with medication. He has no history of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 4: Habits and Lifestyle Factors He is an ex-smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but did have a 30 pack-year history. Alcohol use is moderate. Mr.M's BMI falls within the overweight category  and he has maintained a relatively inactive lifestyle since retirement.  Slide 5: Recent History & Symptoms Mr.M recently underwent a total hip replacement surgery four weeks ago. He reports increasingly difficult  short breaths and mild chest pain over the last 48 hours. These are classic signs of acute PE that can occur postoperatively.  Slide 6: Clinical Examination On examination  Mr.M's respiratory rate is elevated  SpO2 levels are moderately reduced on room air  and his heart rate is slightly tachycardic.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,30,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation   Slide 1: Introduction  This presentation details a case of a patient who experienced an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). The discussion will encompass the patient's demographics  past medical history  presentation  diagnosis  management  and follow-up  placing a special emphasis on clinical reasoning and evidence-based medicine.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 65-year-old African American female. This demographic occupies a high-risk category for APE due to age  race  and sex. Literature shows that APE tends to be more prevalent in aged  African American  and female patients.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  This patient has a significant past medical history including 2 major risk factors for pulmonary embolism: obesity (BMI 35) and Hypertension. She is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. She also has a sedentary lifestyle which is also prevalent in the literature as a common risk factor for APE.  Slide 4: Presentation and Symptoms  The patient presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and hemoptysis. The pain was pleuritic in nature  worse with inspiration. She also reported feeling light-headed. In hindsight  she acknowledged insidious leg swelling over the past 2 weeks.  Slide 5: Diagnosis  Suspecting an APE  the medical team administered Wells' Criteria which included: 1. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT -3 points 2. An alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE -3 points Even without further investigation  this gave a total of 6 points  placing her in the high probability category for a Pulmonary Embolism. A CT pulmonary angiogram was done confirming the presence of a thrombus in the left pulmonary artery  leading to the diagnosis of APE.  Slide 6: Management  The patient was started on immediate anticoagulation therapy with Heparin as per the standard. In parallel  bridging to long-term anticoagulation with Warfarin was initiated. As she was hemodynamically stable  thrombolysis was not considered.  Slide 7: Follow-up  She responded well to the treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms. To manage her risk factors  she was advised to control her obesity and hypertension. This serves as a stark reminder that patient factors like lifestyle and chronic conditions should be adequately managed to reduce incidence and recurrence of PE.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case serves to illustrate how awareness about patient demographics  past medical history and risk factors has a significant role in the prompt diagnosis  effective management and prevention of acute pulmonary embolism.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,34,Title: Acute Pulbarry Embolism in a Middle-Aged Woman: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Case of a 50-year-old African American woman presenting with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. The relatively high incidence of thromboembolic events within the African American population makes this a prototypical case.  Slide 2: Patient Background Patient is a single  working professional with a history of long sedentary work periods  frequent long-distance traveling  and recent orthopedic surgery (hip replacement 4 weeks prior). No known family history of blood disorders. Patient is overweight (BMI 29.8)  non-smoker  and rarely consumes alcohol.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain which worsens with deep breaths and intermittent dry cough. Her vital signs on arrival were: BP 142/88 mmHg  HR 105/min  RR 22/min  Temp 37.2°C (98.9°F)  SpO2 92% on room air.  Slide 4: Past Medical History No history of major illnesses. However  she does have a high-risk profile: overweight  recent surgery  limited mobility due to sedentary work lifestyle and travel  and no regular exercise. Medical history also reports sporadic use of estrogen-protestin oral contraceptives.   Slide 5: Examination and Test Results Physical examination reveals tachypnea and low-grade fever. Labs showed slightly raised D-Dimer levels and ECG indicated sinus tachycardia. Chest Radiograph is normal and a subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram reveals the presence of a clot blocking a pulmonary artery.  Slide 6: Conclusion and Treatment Plan The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism owing to her recent orthopedic surgery  prolonged immobility  hormonal contraceptives  and obesity. Emergency therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with intravenous administration of heparin. Later  she was switched to orally administered anticoagulants and advised for regular follow-ups.  Slide 7: Key Takeaways The high-risk history of this patient stresses the need for strong thromboprophylaxis strategies post-surgery  especially within demographics that have increased susceptibility to thromboembolic events.

Slide 2: Chief Complaint The patient presents with acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain radiating to the back  and sudden feeling of apprehension.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  5 years ago. Other history includes hypertension controlled with medications for the past ten years  current smoker with 40 pack-years history  and past history of alcohol abuse but quit 15 years ago.   Slide 4: Current Medical Condition Based on symptoms  a likely diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) was suspected. Differential diagnoses included acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pneumothorax  due to the sudden onset of the symptoms.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Investigations An ECG showed right heart strain pattern consistent with Acute PE but was not specific. Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of Acute PE revealing a clot in the right pulmonary artery. D-Dimer test was positive. Additional findings: Elevated troponin I levels.   Slide 6: Risk Factors Contributing to Current Condition The contributing risk factors in this case included the patient’s previous history of DVT  long-term smoking habit  hypertension  and his occupation that potentially exposed him to prolonged immobilization. African Americans are reported to have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism than Caucasians.  Slide 7: Treatment and Patient Education The patient was urgently treated with anticoagulants. Therapeutic heparin was started  bridged to warfarin. Risk factor modification strategies were emphasized  including smoking cessation. Given his past medical history  the patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of DVT and PE to monitor for recurrence.  Slide 8: Prognosis and Follow-up With appropriate treatment  the patient showed marked improvement in symptoms. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor coagulation status  control hypertension  and offer support on smoking cessation. Follow-up plan to evaluate warfarin therapy by PT/INR measurements.   Final Slide: Importance of Case Study  This case highlights the importance of considering past medical history and recognizing the urgency of acute PE. Providing the right treatment promptly can significantly improve patient outcomes. It also drives home the importance of educating patients for early recognition of PE symptoms and risk factor management.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,46,Slide 1: Introduction  The case we are discussing today involves a patient diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  a potentially life-threatening condition that affects approximately 600 000 individuals each year in the United States alone.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a dessign choice reflecting the fact that while PE can affect any individual  its incidence rises sharply after the age of 60  with a mean age of approximately 70 years. Gender distribution is roughly equal; however  males have slightly higher mortality rates. The risk of PE is also slightly higher amongst Caucasians than amongst African Americans or Hispanics.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history of several factors that are known to increase the risk of a PE. He has a prior diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  has recently undergone hip replacement surgery  and has been largely immobilized for the past week. He also has a coexistent diagnosis of hypertension and is a former smoker  having quit approximately five years prior to this event.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Upon presentation  our patient complained of sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens upon deep breathing  light-headedness  and a rapid pulse. These are typical symptoms of acute PE  although it's crucial to note that overall symptoms of PE are often non-specific  making it a challenging condition to diagnose.  Slide 5: Imaging and Diagnostic Tests  A CT pulmonary angiography confirmed a thrombus in the left lower lobe  and D-Dimer tests were significantly elevated  consistent with a PE diagnosis.   Slide 6: Treatment and Management  Our patient is currently being treated with anticoagulation therapy  the first line of treatment for most patients with acute PE. He also undergoes regular imaging to monitor progress and ensure clot dissolution.  Slide 7: Conclusion and Discussion  Pulmonary embolism remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity across the globe. Early recognition  accurate diagnosis  and prompt initiation of therapy are the cornerstones of patient outcomes in cases of acute PE.  References: (Add references here)

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,51,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation   Slide 1: Introduction We will be presenting the case of Lisa J.  a 65-year-old Caucasian female with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The prevalence of PE is similar among genders  but incidence increases with age and is more common in Caucasian individuals. The case helps us to understand the complexities of recognizing and managing acute PE.  Slide 2: Patient Profile Lisa is a retired teacher who lives with her husband in the suburban area. She was previously active in her community but has recently reduced her activity due to COVID-19 restrictions. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and total right hip arthroplasty performed years ago. She has no known allergies.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Lisa reported feeling suddenly unwell with chest discomfort  shortness of breath  coughing  and rapid heart rate. She is also anxious due to the abrupt onset of these symptoms. These nonspecific symptoms often make the diagnosis of PE challenging.  Slide 4: Relevant Medical History Considering Lisa's past medical history  a review of any history of blood clotting disorders  recent travels  prolonged immobilization  surgery  or estrogen use has been assessed. She confirmed that she has no family history of blood clotting disorders  hadn't traveled recently  and has been relatively mobile at home.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination and Diagnosis  Upon initial examination  Lisa's vital signs were stable except for tachypnea and tachycardia. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed clear lungs and normal heart sounds. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed due to the high index of suspicion  revealing multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. Lisa was consequently diagnosed with acute bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Management  After diagnosing Lisa with acute PE  she was started on anticoagulation therapy as per clinical guidelines. She was monitored closely  and options regarding length of therapy and choice of anticoagulant were discussed.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Lisa's case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing a pulmonary embolism given the nonspecific symptoms. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy can drastically improve patient outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of being observant and maintaining a high index of suspicion  particularly in patients with risk factors for PE  such as advanced age and recent surgery.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,52,Title: Clinical Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Geriatric Patient  Slide 1: Case Overview Our patient  Mr. Brown  is a 72-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath and severe chest pain. Mr. Brown works as a truck driver with sedentary habits and long uninterrupted driving hours.  Slide 2: Demographics and Risk Factors Research indicates that pulmonary embolism (PE) most commonly affects patients over the age of 60  and African-Americans have the second highest rate of hospitalization due to PE. Moreover  prolonged immobility  like that seen in long-haul truck drivers  is a known risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently PE.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Brown is a former smoker with a history of controlled hypertension and a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31  placing him in the obese category. Notably  he underwent an orthopedic surgery for a hip replacement 6 months ago. He has been compliant with regular follow-ups  and this has been his first such episode.  Slide 4: Recent Surgical History Recent surgery  particularly orthopedic surgery  is a significant factor in PE development due to the high risk of blood clot formation. Obesity  hypertension and smoking are also well-known risk factors. So  Mr. Brown's history makes his presentation less surprising.  Slide 5: Current Presentation Mr. Brown presented to the ED with chest pain  shortness of breath and tachycardia  classic signs of PE. His oxygen saturation on room air was 89%  showing obvious hypoxemia.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests Upon suspicion of PE  a D-dimer test was conducted  which showed elevated levels – an indicator of possible clot degradation. An EKG showed signs consistent with acute right heart strain. A subsequent CT Pulmonary Angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 7: Management & Follow-up Mr. Brown was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy and admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. In follow-ups  he will require continued anticoagulation therapy and a potential review of lifestyle habits to prevent recurrence.  Slide 8: Conclusion It's critical to consider PE when a patient  particularly in demographic groups at higher risk  presents with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and tachycardia. Medical history  compliance to post-operative care and lifestyle habits play an important role in diagnosing and managing PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,53,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Case Overview: We will be exploring the case of a middle-aged woman presenting with symptoms of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  and how her background and past medical history contribute to her current clinical situation.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian woman hailing from a suburb of Albany  New York. She is a former smoker  a relatively sedentary office worker  and is overweight with a BMI of about 29. Literature indicates that APE is more frequent among older individuals  often Caucasian  and those with certain risk factors such as obesity and smoking.  Slide 3: Patient's Presenting Symptoms The patient presents with sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain  tachycardia  and near syncope. These symptoms are common in many APE cases and are often severe.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Her past medical history includes hypertension  controlled with medication  and a recent orthopedic surgery on her knee 4 weeks prior. The latter is particularly relevant as it increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common precursor to APE.   Slide 5: Examination & Lab Reports Upon physical examination  nothing remarkably abnormal is found  other than tachycardia. Lab findings include elevated D-dimer levels. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirms the presence of large bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Slide 6: Risk Factor Analysis Our patient's risk factors for APE include her age  obesity  former smoking  recent surgery  and sedentary lifestyle. Literature indicates that these are typical risk factors for the condition.  Slide 7: Discussion and Conclusion This case of APE underlines the importance of considering a patient's demographics and past medical history in clinical evaluation and diagnosis. It also drives home the crucial role of pertinent risk factors in the pathogenesis of the condition. Close management and personalized care are key in these patients.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,61,Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will delve into a case study of a patient suffering from Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  a prevalent but often overlooked emergent medical issue.  Slide 2: Case Summary Our subject is Patient X  a 65-year-old Afro-American female arriving in the emergency department complaining of chest pain  difficulty breathing  and mild lightheadedness.  Slide 3: Medical History Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  obesity  and a recent total right hip replacement surgery. No known drug allergies. She quit smoking 20 years ago and has a broad family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 4: More on APE APE typically presents itself more in older adults  particularly those over the age of 60  with a similar prevalence in both genders. Studies have shown racial disparities in the incidence of APE with Afro-Americans having a higher incidence rate.  Slide 5: Symptoms Patient X reports symptoms began suddenly three hours prior  describing the chest pain as sharp and worse upon taking deep breaths. The dyspnea and lightheadedness onset were simultaneous with chest pain.  Slide 6: Physical Examination On examination  Patient X had a raised pulse rate at 105 beats/min  and her blood pressure was low with a reading of 100/70 mmHg. Her breathing rate was 24 breaths/min  and her oxygen saturation was 86% on room air.  Slide 7: Diagnosis An urgent CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered given the clinical suspicion of APE  which confirmed the diagnosis showing a large clot burden in the right and left pulmonary arteries.  Slide 8: Associated Risk Factors Risk factors present in Patient X include surgical history (recent hip replacement)  obesity  hypertension  family history of cardiovascular conditions  and age. The literature shows a strong link between these risk factors and APE.  Slide 9: Treatment  Treatment for Patient X included anticoagulation therapy for clot dissolution and addressing the underlying and associated risk factors.  Slide 10: Conclusion Early recognition and treatment of APE are paramount and can be challenging due to its varied presentation. As clinicians  it’s essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for APE  particularly in patients presenting common symptoms and possess associated risk factors. P.E. is a preventable cause of hospital death if promptly diagnosed and accurately treated.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,62,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a serious medical condition causing sudden blockage in the lung arteries. The blockage usually starts in the lower extremities and travels into the right side of the heart  then into the pulmonary arteries. Recent literature show increased incidences in older adults  both men and women  and some racial/ethnic groups including African-Americans.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case is centered around a 68 year-old African-American female. She is post-menopausal and overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.6.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had successful right hip replacement surgery two weeks prior to the current event.  Slide 4: Presentation and Diagnosis The patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  and light-headedness. An immediate computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed  and it confirmed the presence of a clot in her left pulmonary artery  leading to a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 5: Risk Factors Relevant to the Case Risk factors applicable to our patient include:  - Obesity (BMI >30) - Major Surgery  - Previous DVT - Older Age  - Prolonged immobility - African-American ancestry   Slide 6: Treatment and Outcome The patient was admitted and immediately started on anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin overlapped with warfarin. Her hospital stay was complicated by bleeding  a common side effect of anticoagulation treatment.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,71,Title: A Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Slide 1: Introduction - First  let's discuss Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Pulmonary embolism happens when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery in the lung  blocking blood flow to part of the lung. It can be life-threatening and needs immediate treatment.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  - Our patient is a 60-year old Caucasian male. Research suggests that acute pulmonary embolism presents equally in both genders. However  the incidence increases with age  with a higher concentration among the 60+ age group. Racial disparities exist  with Caucasians experiencing a higher incidence rate.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - Our patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago  successfully managed with anticoagulants. He also lives with hypertension managed with beta-blockers and has hyperlipidemia controlled by statins. - The patient stopped smoking 10 years ago following a minor stroke event.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms - The patient came to the ER with shortness of breath  chest pain  and fainting. These symptoms started suddenly while he was gardening at home.  - On a scale of 0-10  the patient rated his chest pain a 7. He described it as a sharp pain  exacerbated with deep inspirations.  Slide 5: Physical Examination & Diagnostics - On examination  the patient was anxious  breathing rapidly with a heart rate of 105 bpm and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. - An EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right heart strain. A D-dimer test came back positive.  - Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a large clot in his right pulmonary artery.  Slide 6: Treatment  - The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation with heparin  along with supplemental oxygen therapy and intravenous fluids for support. Further initiation of thrombolytic therapy was considered due to his recent symptoms of right heart failure.  Slide 7: Take home message - Acute pulmonary embolism is an emergency that requires immediate intervention. - Increasing age  history of DVT  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  as well as lifestyle factors such as tobacco use  are significant risk factors. - Any patient presenting with unexplained dyspnea  chest discomfort  or syncope should be evaluated promptly for possible PE. - Invasive treatment may be necessary in cases of massive PE causing hemodynamic instability.  Slide 8: Discussion  - Invite thoughts  opinions  and experiences related to the case for interactive and insightful discussions.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,74,Title: Case Presentation - Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Slide 1: Patient Demographics  Subject is a 65-year-old Caucasian male from an urban area. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic with a sedentary lifestyle. The patient works as an account manager and spends most of his time seated in an office. He has an unremarkable family history  minimal travel history  and no known drug allergies.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history of controlled hypertension and obesity (BMI: 31.6)  for which he receives regular medical care. He has been on medication for high blood pressure for the past ten years. The patient had a knee replacement surgery six weeks ago due to osteoarthritis. No history of cardiovascular disorders  hypercoagulative states  or cancer.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  Upon presentation  the patient complained of sudden onset shortness of breath  tachypnea  and chest pain that worsened with deep breathing. Mild lower leg swelling was noted upon inspection  consistent with the possibility of deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 4: Diagnosis  The clinical suspicion alone prompted immediate initiation of anticoagulation therapy. Investigations included an echocardiogram indicative of right ventricular strain and D-dimer levels were critically elevated. Later  a CT pulmonary angiogram reveals multiple large emboli in the right and left pulmonary arteries  consistent with Acute Pulmonary Embolism.   Slide 5: Risk Factors and Prevalence  Statistically  older age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  recent orthopedic surgery  and controlled hypertension can all contribute to a higher risk of developing an acute pulmonary embolism. According to literature  acute pulmonary embolism is a common disease among his demographics. It is found to be more prevalent among elderly individuals with chronic diseases and those with immobility or postoperative status.   Slide 6: Management  The patient has been managed with effective anticoagulation therapy  oxygen therapy to alleviate hypoxia  and vigilant monitoring of hemodynamic status. Considering his risk factors  a collaborative approach involving lifestyle modifications  regular follow-ups  physiotherapy  dietary advice  and long-term anticoagulation would be advised.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,75,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will be discussing the case of a patient diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism  a common  often overlooked condition with significant morbidity and mortality.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  a demographic often afflicted with this condition. According to literature  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is common in older adults  often over the age of 60. It's also pertinent to mention that PE has no clear gender predilection  however  men are slightly more prone to have venous thromboembolism than women.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a significant past medical history of Hypertension and Type II Diabetes mellitus. She is a former smoker and has a family history of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Additionally  she suffered hip fracture one month prior  which required bed rest during her recovery.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient arrived at the emergency department with sudden-onset of shortness of breath  chest pain which worsened with deep breaths  and a persistent  dry cough. Also  hemoptysis was reported.  Slide 5: Examination and Diagnosis Physical examination revealed an elevated heart rate (tachycardia)  decreased oxygen saturation  and hypotension. An ECG suggested the presence of sinus tachycardia. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed with a CT angiography of the chest  which revealed a clot in the right pulmonary artery.  Slide 6: Relevant Statistics Pulmonary embolism is a serious health concern  with mortality rates ranging from 10-30% in untreated cases. Mortality can be reduced to 2-8% with proper diagnosis and treatment.  Slide 7: Treatment Plan Our patient was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clotting. The precise choice and duration of anticoagulation would depend on patient-specific factors  such as the patient's bleed risk.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case underscores the need for early identification and prompt management of pulmonary embolism particularly in individuals of an older age group  with other significant comorbidities  history of immobilization and susceptibility to thromboembolic events.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,79,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a condition with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are vital. This presentation will dive into the detailed analysis of a specific case  focusing on the patient's demographics and past medical history  and provide an in-depth overview of PE.  Slide 2: Demographics Patient: 60-year-old Caucasian Male  Background: Retired truck driver  current smoker with a 40 pack/year history Reason for Admission: Sudden onset of shortness of breath and mild chest pain  Slide 3: Past Medical History 1. Hypertension – managed by ACE inhibitors for the past 10 years. 2. Type 2 Diabetes – managed by metformin for the past 5 years. 3. Intermittent Claudication – diagnosed 6 months ago  indicating peripheral arterial disease. 4. Family history of Deep Vein Thrombosis – Mother (deceased).  Slide 4: Recent History He had a long car trip (6 hours) 1 day before the symptoms started.  Slide 5: Literature Reference of the Demographics Several risk factors like advanced age  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  and a history of deep vein thrombosis (either personal or family) have been associated with a higher incidence of PE  as found in numerous epidemiologic studies like the Geneva Study (Perrier et al  1999) and others.  Slide 6: The Importance of Past Medical History An understanding of a patient's past medical history is vital to inform diagnosis and management planning. For instance  a history of intermittent claudication  as in this patient  may suggest the presence of underlying arteriosclerotic disease  laying the foundation for blood clots that might eventually lead to Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 7: The Case Continues In our next session  we will take a closer look at his presenting signs and symptoms  followed by diagnostic considerations for this particular case.   Slide 7: Conclusion Acute Pulmonary Embolism requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Paying close attention to common risk factors and understanding a patient's past medical history plays a critical role in optimal management.  Reference: Perrier A  Roy PM  Sanchez O  et al.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,80,"Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Slide 1: Introduction  A Presentation seeking to shed light on the acute emergency condition Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - its risk factors  clinical presentation  diagnosis  management  and preventive measures based on a case study.  Slide 2: Demographic Information Our patient is a 60-year-old African-American woman. We choose this demographic because literature shows that PE occurs most commonly in individuals above 60 (Punto de Mira  2009)  and that African-American women may be at a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) development (Zöller B et al  2014).  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history of prolonged immobilization due to a hip fracture 1 year ago  obesity with a BMI of 35  and hypertension. These are known significant risk factors for PE (Gregory et al.  2019).  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint The patient presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. These classic signs of acute PE  though occurring in only half of the case  should always raise suspicion (Wells  1998).  Slide 5: Diagnosis A high D-dimer level was found on the blood test  and a CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of a clot in the pulmonary artery. These are considered gold standard diagnostic measures for PE (Perrier et al.  2005).  Slide 6: Treatment and Management The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy initially with low molecular weight heparin and then shifted to long-term oral anticoagulants. Inferior vena cava filter placement was considered due to her high risk for recurrent PE (Konstantinides et al.  2019).  Slide 7: Prevention Measures Management of modifiable risk factors  including weight reduction  control of hypertensive state  and early mobilization during periods of prolonged immobilization.  Slide 8: Conclusion Early suspicion  accurate diagnosis  and prompt treatment of PE could save lives. It is critical to manage and control risk factors to prevent recurrent PE  improving patient's quality of life.  References  1. Gregory  C. et al.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,81,Slide 1: Introduction Today we are going to discuss a case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). These pathologies are life-threatening and need urgent treatment.  Slide 2: Demographics Our patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  given the higher reported incidence of Pulmonary Embolism in African-Americans. Also  cases increase with age  making the average patient age 60-70 years old.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a past medical history that is significant for Obesity (BMI 36)  Type 2 Diabetes  Hypertension  and a deep vein thrombosis following a fracture of the right femur 12 years ago. All these factors have been related to higher risk of developing APE.  Slide 4: Symptoms He presents complaints of sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and light-headedness that started 2 days ago. The chest pain is sharp  gets worse with deep breaths and doesn't radiate to any place.  Slide 5: Physical Examination During the physical examination  he appears anxious  has a respiratory rate of 22 breathes per minute  heart rate of 108 beats per minute  blood pressure of 132/85  and saturation of 92% on room air. Examination of his lower extremities reveals no signs of DVT.  Slide 6: Next Steps Given this scenario of suspected Acute Pulmonary Embolism  the next steps include diagnostic confirmation tests – D-dimer  CTPA  or V/Q scan - and prompt treatment should be initiated based on high clinical suspicion.  Slide 7: Teaching Points Through this case  we are reminded that Pulmonary Embolism can present in a multitude of ways. Past medical history and risk factors can significantly guide suspicion. Prompt diagnosis is crucial due to the significant mortality associated with any delays.  Slide 8: Conclusion In conclusion  Acute Pulmonary Embolism is an example of a life-threatening condition that demands a high level of suspicion to ensure timely diagnosis and lifesaving treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,82,Title: A Case Study on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Slide 1: Introduction   Today we will review a case that focuses on a patient diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). Understanding the demographic trends will allow us to appreciate the disease's real-world application better.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  considering the fact that APE incidence rates are higher in the elderly population and lean towards females slightly. According to the literature  Caucasians are at a lower risk for APE compared to African-Americans  but case prevalence remains substantial in this demographic.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   The patient's past medical history reveals that she is a long-term smoker with 30 pack-years smoking history. Also recently diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Both factors  smoking and AF  significantly raise her risk for APE.  Slide 4: Additional Risk Factors   The patient also has a sedentary lifestyle  which increases her risk of deep vein thrombosis  which can lead to a pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  she has a BMI of 29  indicating that she is in the overweight range. Studies have indicated a positive correlation of obesity with APE risk.    Slide 5: Hospital Admission and Symptoms   The patient was admitted due to sudden sharp chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness- classic symptoms of APE. She also reported increased rate of palpitations which was of concern considering her AF diagnosis.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests   Her diagnostic tests confirmed APE. Elevated D-Dimers  Chest CT angiogram showing a filling defect in pulmonary arteries  and ECG showing signs of right heart strain were all supportive of a diagnosis of APE.  Slide 7: Treatment   The patient was promptly started on anticoagulants as per the clinical protocols. Considering her AF  chronic anticoagulation was advised post-hospitalization to mitigate future thromboembolic events.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case exemplifies the higher risk of pulmonary embolism among elderly  overweight females with histories of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and co-morbidities such as Atrial Fibrillation. By understanding these demographics and risk factors  we can better recognize and manage patients with acute pulmonary embolism.   Reference Slide:  1. Smith SB  Geske JB  Kathuria P  et al.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,87,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Clinical Case Presentation  Slide 1: Patient Introduction Our patient  for today's discussion  is a 45-year old Caucasian male with a history of long-haul truck driving.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics & Background Literature indicates that pulmonary embolism (PE) frequently occurs in middle-aged and older populations  with males slightly more affected than females. Also  certain occupations like long-haul truck driving  which involves extended periods of immobility  increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and consequently  PE.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a history of obesity (BMI 32)  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and tobacco use. He does not have a history of previous surgeries but reports a familial incidence of blood clot disorders.   Slide 4: History Linkage with PE Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  and a family history of blood clot disorders are all known risk factors for PE.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,98,Slide 1: Understanding the Case - Patient Profile  Our patient is a 70-year-old African-American female  as studies show that individuals in this demographic group have a higher frequency of venous thromboembolism which includes pulmonary embolism.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient has a significant medical history that includes obesity and a recent total knee replacement surgery. She also has a long-standing history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both under control with medication.   Slide 3: Presentation and Diagnosis  The patient came to the emergency department presenting severe shortness of breath  chest pain  and a cough with bloody sputum. The temporal relation of the symptoms following a major surgery and the classic symptomatology made acute pulmonary embolism (PE) a likely diagnosis.   Slide 4: Verification with Objective Assessments  On physical examination  she was in acute distress with tachypnea and tachycardia. A CT scan with contrast verified the presence of blood clots in the pulmonary arteries  thus confirming an acute pulmonary embolism.   Slide 5: Relation to Demographics and Medical History   The patient’s race  age  obesity  and recent surgery are all risk factors associated with PE. Obesity leads to increased blood clotting  and surgeries  especially orthopedic procedures  can cause a high amount of bone marrow fat to enter the veins  leading to potential blood clots.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,3,100,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  This presentation reviews the case of a patient who presented with acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  an often fatal condition with a substantial morbidity. We'll take a look at his demographics  past medical history  symptoms  treatment  and recovery.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year old African American male. He is retired but used to work in an office setup where he spent most of his time seated. He is a non-smoker and moderate drinker. His BMI is 30.2   falling within the obesity range.  Note: Studies suggest increased risk of PE among African Americans compared to other racial groups.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both well-controlled with medication. He had an ischemic stroke 5 years prior  with almost full recovery  and has been on aspirin since then. His family history reveals that his mother suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) event at the age of 70.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented with sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsened with deep breaths  and a fainting episode earlier in the day. On admission  his vital signs were: BP 95/60 mmHg  HR 112 beats/minute  respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute and Oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  Slide 5: Diagnoses and Treatment  Due to his symptoms and risk factors  a D-dimer test was immediately carried out which came back positive. A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed which confirmed a diagnosis of acute PE. He was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin and in due course  Warfarin was introduced with continuous monitoring of INR.  Slide 6: Rehabilitation & Follow-up  The patient was encouraged to increase physical activity to reduce obesity risks and increase mobility. His blood glucose and blood pressure levels continue to be monitored. He remains on Warfarin therapy  and receives regular check-ups to monitor his condition.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Though this case had a successful outcome with early intervention  it emphasizes the importance of routine risk assessment for PE  especially in patients with pertinent risk factors. Understanding the diverse demographics and incorporating targeted preventative measures is crucial in medical practice.

Additionally  he's experiencing light-headedness and a sense of impending doom. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He also had a total hip replacement 10 days ago. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on atorvastatin and lisinopril. His vitals on presentation show tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm  tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 26 per minute  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg and a temperature of 98.6°F.  On physical examination  he appears anxious and distressed and he is using accessory muscles to breathe. The rest of the examination  including cardiovascular system and other systems  are unremarkable. Clinically  the presentation is most consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism  probably secondary to deep vein thrombosis due to recent orthopedic surgery.

She also reports recent long car travel in the postoperative period. On examination  she appears anxious and dyspneic  with tachypnea and tachycardia. She denies any fever  cough  or contact with known tuberculosis patients. She has no familial history of venous thromboembolism or inheritable clotting disorder. There is no known history of malignancy or intake of any hormone therapy. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally in social settings. Her current medications include oral hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily for her hypertension. Considering her medical history  sudden onset of symptoms  and risk factors  an acute pulmonary embolism is suspected.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,5,A 55-year-old African American man with a medical history of obesity and recent orthopedic surgery presents to the emergency room with symptoms of sudden onset of chest pain  dyspnea  and palpitations which started 2 hours ago. He mentioned feeling lightheaded and weak. He denies any history of smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use. He has been less mobile since his surgery 2 weeks ago and stopped his prescribed prophylactic anticoagulants several days ago due to gastrointestinal discomfort. On examination  he appears anxious and is visibly straining to breathe. His vitals include: pulse rate of 110 beats/minute  blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. His BMI is 32 (obese) and he is afebrile. Cardiac examination is normal except for a slightly increased heart rate. Pulmonary examination shows symmetric breath sounds with no wheezing  rales  or rhonchi. Other systems are within normal limits. Likely diagnosis at this point is acute pulmonary embolism  possibly a consequence of his recent mobility decrease and cessation of his anticoagulants. Further studies (D-dimer  CT angiography) are required for confirmation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,6,A 60-year-old African-American female with a two-year history of hormone replacement therapy for menopause presents with a sudden onset of sharp  stabbing chest pain and shortness of breath that began 2 hours prior while doing household chores.

She has a family history of venous thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol and lives an active lifestyle. She takes her hormone replacement medication regularly.   Her symptoms are consistent with acute pulmonary embolism  making her condition potentially life-threatening. Early identification and management of her symptoms are critical to prevent any further progression of the disease.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,7,Patient Representation:  Ms. X is a 65-year-old post-menopausal African American woman with a past medical history of stage IV ovarian cancer for which she has been undergoing chemotherapy. She also has a history of hypertension and obesity. She does not have a personal or family history of thromboembolic disease. She has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. She presents today with sudden onset of sharp  pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath that has progressively worsened over the past several hours. Accompanying symptoms include light-headedness  sweating  and an episode of hemoptysis. She denies recent surgeries  prolonged immobilization  or long-distance travels.   Relevant systemic exam reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest. Her vitals demostrate a blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90% on room air. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Given her history of malignancy and presenting symptoms  she is assessed to have a high index of suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism.  (Note: PE is typically more common in patients older than 60 years and those with known risk factors such as cancer and immobility. Females are at additional risk due to hormone fluctuations and there seems to be a higher prevalence in African Americans. Ms. X's age  race  gender  cancer history  hypertension  obesity  and previous history of smoking put her in a high-risk category for PE.)
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,8,A 60-year-old African American female with a history of Stage II breast cancer for which she is receiving chemotherapy presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset sharp  stabbing chest pain and severe breathlessness for the last 2 hours. She rates her chest pain as 8 on a scale of 10  and it becomes more severe with deep breaths. She also mentions a dry cough and episodes of lightheadedness. She denies any fever  palpitations  or recent travel. She is a non-smoker  follows a regular exercise routine  and has no other major comorbidities apart from her ongoing cancer treatment. On examination  she appears in acute distress with tachycardia  tachypnea  and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Examination of her chest reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side. There is no leg swelling or tenderness. Her ECG shows right heart strain. The clinical presentation and her history of cancer  which is a known risk factor for developing thromboembolic conditions  raises the strong suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,9,Patient Representation:  A 65-year-old African American man presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that increases with deep breathing. He identifies as a long-term smoker with a 40-pack year history. His past medical record shows hypertension and recently had hip replacement surgery 2 weeks prior. He noted the developments over the past few hours. He denied having any fever  cough  or sputum production. His vitals indicated tachycardia with a HR of 110 bpm and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Also  physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds in the lower right lung field. The patient’s symptoms suggest an acute pulmonary embolism likely secondary to postoperative state from the hip surgery. The smoking history and his hypertension also increase his risk for a thromboembolic event. The patient’s African American ancestry is relevant since there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in this demographic  as supported by literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,5,10,A 65-year-old African American woman presents with sudden  sharp chest pain and shortness of breath. She also reports anxiety  light-headedness  rapid heart rate  and mild cough with bloody sputum. She is a former smoker and has a medical history of obesity and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has been off anticoagulants for six months. For the past one week  she has been immobile due to a sprained ankle. Examination shows low oxygen levels and blood pressure. The patient's presentation suggests acute pulmonary embolism  likely due to a dislodged DVT secondary to her period of immobility.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,1,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 56 years old - Gender: Female - Race-Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic White  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain pleuritic in nature  and palpitations. Patient also reports feinted episode.  Medical History:  - History of prolonged immobilization due to recent hip replacement surgery about a month ago - Personal and family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - On hormone replacement therapy (HRT) - Hypertensive  on antihypertensive medication - Former smoker (quit 5 years back) - History of occasional alcohol use - No known drug allergies  Current Medications: - Antihypertensives - Hormone replacement therapy  Social History: - Lives alone  - No history of drug abuse - Retired teacher  The details above correspond to the average demographic details of PE patients provided in current literature. According to several studies  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) can affect individuals of different age groups  however it is common in individuals who are older (> 60 years of age). PE shows a slightly higher incidence rate in females  and race/ethnicity disparities are found in PE prevalence and mortality  with Non-Hispanic whites having higher rates. Previous history of venous thromboembolism like deep vein thrombosis  hypertension  surgery particularly orthopedic surgery  immobilization  use of HRT  smoking  and alcohol are all relevant risk factors.   Because addition of individual patient characteristics  history  signs and symptoms to the demographic data further improves the understanding of the disease  this information was provided.  Note: This patient representation is based on demographic averages and does not represent all patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Each patient's medical history and presentation can significantly vary.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,2,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 63 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Birthplace: United States Residence: Urban area  Medical History:   John is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 8 years ago  and he was treated with anticoagulant therapy at that time. His family history is significant for pulmonary embolism (his father suffered from PE in his late 60s  and his sister in her late 50s).  John has been a smoker for 30 years and has a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. He is also obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2  which puts him in the category of Class I obesity. He has no known drug allergies.  John is mostly sedentary in his lifestyle  and he recently had a hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. Post-surgery  he had to spend fifteen days mostly bed-ridden  which increased his risk of developing blood clots.  Presenting Problem:  John visited the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breathing  and cough (sometimes coughing up blood). He also indicated that he has been feeling lightheaded and faint.  Based on his symptoms  past medical history  and family history  there is a high suspicion that John might be suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,3,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe  Age: 60 years old  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Office worker  Lifestyle: Sedentary  occasional smoker  BMI: 29.7 (Overweight)  Residence: Urban   Presenting Complaint: Sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that is sharp  pleuritic (worsens with deep breaths)  and a persistent dry cough. Also reported dizziness and fainting episodes over the past two days  with increased anxiety levels.   Relevant Past Medical History:   1. Underwent hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - Mild severity  on short-acting beta-antagonists. 3. Hypertension - Currently on medications. 4. On oral contraceptive pills for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 5. Family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Summary of presenting complaint and patient history:   A 60-year-old sedentary Caucasian male office worker with past medical history significant for postoperative hip replacement surgery  COPD  hypertension  and familial predisposition to VTE presenting with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting episodes suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. His use of oral contraceptive pills and high BMI increase his risk factors for the development of VTE and its complications. Smoking history can also contribute to his COPD exacerbation and worsening of respiratory symptoms. His subsequent presentation may likely be due to a combination of these predispositions  warranting urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures.   In this case  the patient's demographic and medical history aligns with typical characteristics of a patient at risk for pulmonary embolism reported in the literature. Middle-aged to elderly individuals with immobility due to recent surgery or hospitalization  co-morbid conditions like COPD  hypertension  and obesity  family history of VTE  smokers  and those on certain medications (e.g. oral contraceptive pills)  are at higher risk. Acute onset of breathlessness  chest pain  and fainting can suggest the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism  particularly in such high-risk settings.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,4,Problem Representation:  Mr. Jones is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. The patient reports abrupt onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens with deep breathing. He also reports an episode of hemoptysis this morning. His vitals show tachycardia and his oxygen saturation is 89% on room air.  In Mr. Jones' past medical history  he has a record of deep venous thrombosis approximately three years ago  treated with anticoagulation therapy. He has been consistent with his post-treatment check-ups. Furthermore  he has been a smoker for the past 25 years with a history of heavy alcohol use but cut down five years ago. He also suffers from hypertension and takes prescribed medication for it. Mr. Jones had undergone a total knee replacement surgery two months back for which he was immobile for several weeks.  Mr. Jones is a perfect candidate for profiling acute pulmonary embolism given his past medical history of deep venous thrombosis  prolonged immobilization post-surgery  and his smoking habit  all of which are significant risk factors for this condition. His hypertension could complicate the situation  leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension if left untreated. His age and ethnicity may also play a role in his risk as literature shows that Caucasian populations and people over the age of 60 have higher rates of pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,5,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  previously worked in a desk job in corporate sector. Marital Status: Married  Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago. For this  he was on anticoagulant therapy but had to discontinue due to gastrointestinal complications. He has always been overweight with a BMI of 30.1  and suffered from a silent myocardial infarction (heart attack) five years ago. He has a well-controlled history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both under treatment. He also has a history of intermittent claudication  suggesting peripheral artery disease. He has never smoked in his life  but occasionally consumes alcohol. Mr. Smith has a familial history of thromboembolic events  including DVT in his father.  Current Issue:  Recently  Mr. Smith has been complaining of sudden  sharp  one-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing. He also mentions shortness of breath on exertion  occasional cough  light-headedness  and rapid heartbeat since last week. He has not noticed any swelling and pain in legs  bleeding or bruises.

He discontinued anticoagulant therapy in the past due to side effects. He has never smoked but consumes alcohol occasionally. His father had a history of DVT. No reported signs of current DVT  bleeding or bruising are present.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,6,Problem Representation:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with acute chest pain and sudden onset shortness of breath. He reports he was fine until two days ago when these symptoms started and have been progressively getting worse. He also complains of light-headedness and palpitations but denies cough  fever  or hemoptysis. He has a previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) one year ago  for which he was on anticoagulation therapy for 6 months. He has been smoke-free for 15 years but smoked one pack a day for 25 years prior. There is no history of inherited thrombophilia in the family. He is overweight with a current BMI of 29  and has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which are well-controlled with oral medications. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Demographics:  Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Residence: Lives with spouse   Past Medical History:  1. Previous DVT: One episode 1 year ago 2. Smoking History: One pack/day for 25 years  quit 15 years ago 3. Obesity: BMI 29 4. Type II Diabetes: Well controlled with medications 5. Hypertension: Well controlled with medications  Presenting symptoms: 1. Acute chest pain 2. Shortness of breath 3. Light-headedness 4. Palpitations  Symptoms he denies: 1. Cough 2. Fever 3. Hemoptysis  This case represents a typical demographic scenario of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism  considering average onset age  gender prevalence  and common risk factors such as obesity  smoking history  previous DVT  and other comorbidities.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,7,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  Gender: Female  Age: 60 years old  Race: Caucasian   Background and Past Medical History:  1. Family History: The patient has a positive family history of deep vein thrombosis and her mother had a pulmonary embolism previously. This family history indicates a possible inherited condition that makes blood clot more easily  leading to the risk of developing pulmonary embolism.  2. Smoking: The patient has a 20 pack-year history of smoking. Smoke contains chemicals that damage blood vessels and can make clots more likely to form.  3. Sedentary Lifestyle: The patient lives a sedentary lifestyle  with an office-bound job and limited physical activity in daily routine  increasing the risk of blood clots.  4. Obesity: The patient has a BMI of 32  classifying her as obese. Obesity increases the pressure in the veins and the risk for blood clot formation.   5. Comorbid Conditions: The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medications.  6. Hormone Therapy: The patient has been on hormone replacement therapy post-menopause  which has known links with increasing blood clot risks.   7. Surgery: The patient had a hip replacement surgery six months ago. The connection between surgery and pulmonary embolism is well-established  as surgery can increase the risk of blood clot formation.  8. Prior Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient had a VTE diagnosed in the past. Having history of VTE can definitely increase the risk for another one.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of sharp  stabbing chest pain  rapid heart rate  and breathlessness. She reports that the pain gets worse with deep breaths. She also reports having coughed up blood  feeling light-headed and having episodes of fainting which led her to seek medical help. The patient is anxious and appeared to be sweaty and bluish in color.  This overall profile and presenting symptoms are suggestive of an acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Immediate investigations and appropriate management plans should be initiated.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,8,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Female - Age: 65 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher - Marital Status: Widowed - Habitation: Lives alone in a suburban community - Economic Status: Middle class  Relevant Medical History:  - Obesity: Patient has a BMI of 33  classifying her as obese which is a contributing risk factor for developing a pulmonary embolism. - Previous DVT: Patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower right leg about two years ago. This predisposes her to a higher likelihood of developing a PE. - Smoking: She is a former smoker. The patient has smoked a half pack a day for about 30 years  quitting 10 years ago. - HRT: Patient has been using estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy (HRT) post-menopause for relief of symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. - Chronic Medical Conditions: The patient is clinically diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication.  - Surgery: She underwent a total knee replacement surgery five months ago. Post-surgical patients are at an increased risk of DVT or PE. - Family History: There is a history of cardiovascular diseases in the family. Her father passed away from a stroke and her mother had peripheral artery disease.  Recent Presentation:  - Patient presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. - She also reports an episode of hemoptysis (coughing up blood). - Symptoms have worsened over the past 24 hours  leading her to seek immediate medical attention. - On physical examination  the patient appears in distress  tachypneic (rapid respiratory rate)  and her oxygen saturation is lower than normal on room air.  In summary  a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a history of obesity  DVT  smoking  HRT use  and recent surgical history presented with symptoms indicative of possible acute pulmonary embolism. Her current health symptomatology  coupled with her past medical history  puts her at a higher risk for an acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,9,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Smith Age: 67 Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Postal Worker Ethnicity: Caucasian  Demographic representation: Studies indicate that older men  aged 60-85  particularly those from the Caucasian ethnicity  seem to present the most significant risk factor for developing acute pulmonary embolism. As such  our patient lies within this high-risk demographic.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith presented with sudden onset chest pain  which he described as 'sharp' and 'stabbing' in nature. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath  cough  and fatigue over the last couple of days. Upon further evaluation  it was discovered that he had noticed a rapid heartbeat and occasional bouts of dizziness.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from three years ago. He had been put on anticoagulant therapy for six months following his diagnosis. Additionally  he is also known to have high blood pressure and has been on antihypertensives since the age of 62. He has no history of diabetes  head trauma  nor any significant pulmonary  hepatic  or renal disease. He does  however  have a history of obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) currently recorded at 31 kg/m2. He also has a history of chronic smoking but quit about ten years ago.  Family history: His mother suffered a stroke at the age of 80  and his father had a myocardial infarction when he was 70.  Social history: Mr. Smith is a widower  lives on his own  and has two adult children who live out of state. He confesses that he mostly leads a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement five years ago  with minimal physical activity which includes occasional walking in the nearby park.  This demographic  social  and medical history underlines some of the significant risk factors for pulmonary embolism  such as advanced age  history of DVT  hypertension  obesity  and a sedentary lifestyle.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,10,Patient Profile:  Patient Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 65 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Merchant Navy Officer  Problem Represented: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  Chief Complaint: John presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens on deep breathing  and a sense of light-headedness. He also reports a faint episode at home.   Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension - Diagnosed 10 years ago and on treatment with Lisinopril. 2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II - Diagnosed 8 years ago  well-controlled with Metformin. 3. On warfarin due to a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) event 5 years ago. His consistent international normalized ratio (INR) values  however  suggest probable non-compliance with the medication. 4. Ex-Smoker - Quit smoking 10 years ago but had a 30 pack/year smoking history prior.  Family History:  1. Father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 70. 2. Mother has chronic atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulants.  Social History:  1. Lives with his wife  a retired teacher. 2. Consumes alcohol moderately  enjoying a glass of wine at dinner. 3. Maintains a sedentary lifestyle and is overweight with a BMI of 28.  Current Episode:  The patient was reported to be in his usual state of health until two days ago  when he started experiencing an acute onset of dyspnea  associated with pleuritic chest pain. The pain is sharp  localized to the right side of his chest  and aggravates upon taking deep breaths or coughing. There was also an instance of fainting which concerned his wife significantly.  Clinical markers suggest the possibility of an acute PE. This is further substantiated by John's past history of DVT and possible non-compliance with warfarin therapy.  Further investigations including a CT pulmonary angiography are immediately necessary to confirm the presence of PE and determine a course of therapy. The patient should be reassessed for adherence to warfarin therapy and better strategies for the prevention of thromboembolic events should be explored.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,11,Problem Representation  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old White female patient presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset shortness of breath and sharp  intense chest pain. Alongside this  she reports experiencing mild dizziness  an elevated heart rate  and coughing up blood.   Demographics: - Age: 65-years-old - Sex: Female - Race: White (Caucasian) - Occupation: Retired schoolteacher - Marital Status: Widowed - Social History: Non-smoker  minimal alcohol use  Past Medical History: - Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: She has had controlled chronic atrial fibrillation for the past 10 years. She has been on Warfarin as an anticoagulant. - Hypertension: She was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  treated with Lisinopril. - Recent Knee-Replacement Surgery: She underwent a right knee-replacement surgery 3 weeks ago and has had limited mobility since then.  Family History: - Father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 70. - Mother passed away due to stroke at the age of 68. - Younger sister aged 62 is alive and has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  This representation is based on data suggesting that the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism increases with age  is more common in women  white individuals  individuals with a history of atrial fibrillation  hypertension  recent surgery (especially orthopedic surgery)  and immobilization. Family history of cardiovascular problems can also be a contributing factor.    Clinical suspicion for this patient is an acute pulmonary embolism  potentially related to her recent knee surgery due to the risk of venous thromboembolism post orthopedic surgery. Also  her chronic atrial fibrillation  long-term use of warfarin  and family history of heart disease further support this diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,12,Patient Profile: Name: Jane Doe Age: 66 Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Urban  Presenting Problem: Jane presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and a fast heart rate. She reports that the chest pain worsens upon deep breathing.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Hip replacement surgery 4 weeks ago - History of varicose veins - Smoked 1 pack per day for 35 years  quit 12 years ago - Long-distance commercial flight (8 hours) 3 days ago - Previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episode 12 years ago - Family history of pulmonary embolism and DVT - Hypertension - Obesity (BMI – 35)  Medications:  - Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily for hypertension - Multivitamin tablet daily - Ibuprofen PRN for hip post-op pain  This problem representation includes demographic data indicating average age of pulmonary embolism onset (66 years old)  female sex (higher risk)  and Caucasian ethnicity (higher incidence). A past history of immobilization (due to hip surgery and long-distance travel)  varicose veins  previous DVT episodes  family history of PE and DVT  hypertension and obesity  together with a history of heavy smoking  all place the patient at increased risk of PE. The use of a thiazide diuretic suggests a potential electrolyte imbalance  which may cause additional risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,13,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 60 years Sex: Female Race: White Occupation: Retired accountant Lifestyle: Sedentary  smoker for the past 40 years Weight: Overweight (BMI of 28) Location: Urban dwelling in Midwest America  Presenting Symptoms:  Complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain particularly upon breathing deep  and feeling lightheaded. Also experiencing a mild cough  with occasional blood-tinged sputum.   Medical History:  Past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around 5 years ago. She was treated with anticoagulation therapy then. She also has chronic hypertension  for which she is under medication. She had an episode of surgery (hysterectomy) 2 years back. Family history includes a father who died from stroke and a mother diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is also a pack-a-day smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history.  Recent History:  Around a week ago  she had a long flight from California back to her home in the Midwest  during which she was seated for an extended period.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90  a regular pulse of 110 bpm and slightly labored breathing at 22 breathes/minute. Oxygen saturation level is 95% on room air.   Problem Representation:   60-year-old overweight white female with a past history of deep vein thrombosis  sedentary lifestyle  a smoker and possessing other risk factors such as history of surgery and extended travel  now presenting with symptoms indicative of acute pulmonary embolism  including sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  cough and hemoptysis. The patient looks to be in respiratory distress with an increased heart rate and hypertensive blood pressure. Symptoms need urgent attention and management to prevent serious complication.   This problem representation is consistent with the general demographic usually affected by this condition - middle-aged to elderly adults with risk factors such as weight  sedentary lifestyle  history of DVT  smoking  and recent prolonged immobilization.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,14,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographic Information: 65-year-old Caucasian female  - Occupation: Retired teacher  - Living Situation: Lives alone in a suburban house  - Tobacco Usage: 40 pack-years smoking history  quit 10 years ago - Alcohol: Drinks socially  approximately 2 drinks per week - Family History: Mother suffered from deep vein thrombosis  father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 82 - Medical History: Hypertension  Type II Diabetes  History of recurrent deep vein thrombosis currently on warfarin  Osteoporosis - Medications:    - Metformin for Type II Diabetes    - Lisinopril for Hypertension    - Warfarin for recurrent DVT    - Calcium and Vitamin D supplements for Osteoporosis  Presenting with:  - Shortness of breath that came suddenly - Sharp  stabbing chest pain that intensifies with deep breaths  - A feeling of fast  irregular heart rate - Fainted once during the episode of intense chest pain - Coughing with blood tinged sputum  Reasonably  based on the demographic representation from recent literature  this typical patient profile can both represent patients at high risk for having acute pulmonary embolism and illustrate the kind of patient that one might commonly expect to see in a clinical setting.  It should be noted that the occurrence of acute pulmonary embolism varies with age  race  and gender. For instance  literature reports that the annual incidence of pulmonary embolism significantly increases with age and is higher in women. Furthermore  Caucasians and African-Americans have a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to other racial groups. The major risk factors for acute pulmonary embolism are previous history of DVT  heart diseases  and prolonged immobility. Conditions such as cancer  obesity  and genetic predisposition could also contribute to the development of acute pulmonary embolism. Cigarette smoking has also been established as a risk factor. Additionally  the usage of certain medications like hormone therapy and oral contraceptives can also increase the risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,15,Problem Representation  Patient Information: Mr. Smith  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presents himself in the emergency department. Lives in a suburban household  has a history of professional life with sedentary office jobs  has habits of heavy smoking (1 pack/day for 30 years)  and follows a diet high in saturated fats. The patient complains of sudden chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. No known drug allergies have been reported.   Medical History: Significant details of Mr. Smith's past medical history include hypertension for 10 years and being overweight with a BMI of 27. He had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episode in his early 50's but failed to follow-up for proper treatment. Additionally  he went through a hip replacement surgery two years back which had kept him immobile for an extended period. He has also reported occasional episodes of tachycardia. The family history is significant for heart diseases with his father dying of a myocardial infarction at age 60.  Current Medications (Prescribed for hypertension): - Metoprolol 50 mg Twice Daily - Lisinopril 20 mg Once Daily  Problem Detail: Mr. Smith's sudden onset of chest pain  difficulty in breathing  coupled with his pertinent medical history of venous thromboembolism  hypertension  a notably sedentary lifestyle  and significant hereditary predisposition suggests a presumptive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. This problem may take a severe toll on the patient's overall heart function if left untreated.  Further action plan: The patient requires an immediate diagnostic process like D-dimer blood test  chest CT scan  or pulmonary angiography to confirm pulmonary embolism diagnosis. Following the confirmation of diagnosis  an immediate referral to a cardiologist is necessary for an appropriate treatment plan  including anticoagulants or thrombolytics as suitable. The medical team should also consider lifestyle modification advice to the patient following treatment such as diet changes  increased mobility  and smoking cessation for long-term management of the condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,16,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 50-year-old woman of caucasian descent  non-smoker  living in a suburban community.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents at the emergency department with symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and a slight cough. The pain worsens upon deep breathing. She also reports feeling somewhat lightheaded  fatigued  and rapid heartbeat.  Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  requiring anticoagulation therapy  which was discontinued six months back. In addition  she has been on oral contraceptives for the past five years due to irregular menses  and she is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. She also has a family history of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE).   Lifestyle Factors: The patient has a sedentary lifestyle  with her job requiring her to sit for extended periods at a time. She does little to no exercise and follows a diet high in fat and carbs  contributing to her obesity.  Recent Activities: The patient recently took a long-haul flight (approximately 8 hours) a week ago for a business meeting and reports that she did not walk around during the flight.  Demographic Characteristics: Gender and age play a significant role in susceptibility to PE. According to literature  the incidence is slightly higher in females  with a peak incidence in the 65-69 year age group. However  PE can occur across all age groups. The patient's ethnicity as caucasian also has relevance  as literature suggests a higher incidence rate in caucasians compared to other racial groups.  Given this information  the patient's current symptoms  coupled with her significant past medical history  lifestyle  and recent activities  raise a high degree of suspicion for acute PE that requires immediate attention and proper diagnostic management.   Please note that while this profile is founded on general statistical trends  individual patient experiences can vary significantly.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,19,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Name: Undisclosed (maintaining patient confidentiality) Age: 60 years (as PE is more common in individuals 60 years and over) Gender: Female (PE slightly more common in women) Ethnicity: Caucasian (PE incidence is higher among Whites compared to other ethnic groups)  Current Problem: Presented symptoms consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism  including sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp  stabbing chest pain that may get worse with deep breaths  rapid heart rate and unexplained cough  sometimes with bloody sputum.  Past Medical History: 1. Recent Surgery. Underwent hip replacement surgery 2-weeks prior. (Orthopedic surgical patients have a high risk of developing PE). 2. Prior DVT. Documented history of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago. (Having a history of DVT/PE increases the risk for future occurrences). 3. Obesity. BMI suggests that she falls in the class II obesity range. (Obesity is a well-known risk factor for PE). 4. Hormone Replacement Therapy. Has been on hormone replacement therapy post-menopause for about 10 years now. (The use of HRT carries increased risk of DVT and consequently PE). 5. Sedentary Lifestyle. On enquiry  she confirms a lack of exercise in her daily routine. (Physical inactivity increases the risk of DVT/PE).  Family History: Mother had a history of DVT.  Smoking Status: Non-smoker.  Alcohol Consumption: Occasional; socially.    Investigation Findings: CT pulmonary angiography confirms the presence of a clot in the pulmonary artery  which confirms the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism. The ECG shows signs consistent with pulmonary embolism  such as an S1Q3T3 pattern.  This information is provided as an example based on an average patient experiencing a pulmonary embolism  and the specifics may not apply to all patients with pulmonary embolism. Individual patient experiences may vary.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,20,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Female - Age: 45 - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Desk job (sedentary work environment) - Living Environment: Urban residence  Presenting Problem: The patient presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden shortness of breath  sharp chest pains that intensifies with deep breaths (pleuritic chest pain)  and palpitations. She has no history of prior pulmonary disease.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Recent major surgery (three weeks ago): Underwent a total hip replacement surgery - Obesity: Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 - Chronic Hormonal Therapy: On oral contraceptive pills for the past ten years - Previous history of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) post-pregnancy (5 years ago) - Personal Habits: Smoker (1 pack/year)  occasional alcohol consumer - Family History: Father diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolism at the age of 55  paternal grandfather died of stroke  Epidemiological evidence suggests that Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is more common in females  particularly those over the age of 40. This often correlates with certain risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle  recent surgery  chronic hormonal therapy  obesity  and a history of DVT. A family history of PE or other thrombotic events also represents a significant risk. The described patient presentation  therefore  aligns with the demographic distribution and common presentation of PE. She has multiple risk factors for PE  including a prior DVT and recent surgery. Her personal habits  like smoking and occasional alcohol consumption  are additional health risk factors. Her family history suggests a possible genetic predisposition to thrombotic events. As such  acute PE is a consideration in her differential diagnosis given her presenting symptoms.

Her genetic predisposition (Factor V Leiden mutation and a family history of PE)  alongside her continued use of hormone replacement therapy  add risks for clot formation. Obesity has also been suggested to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism - including PE.  On the whole  her age  gender  and ethnicity are typical for PE cases based on literature. However  it should be stressed that PE can affect individuals across different demographic spectrums. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality from this potentially fatal condition.  This patient's recent  sudden  and severe onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and hemoptysis are all clinical signs suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. The recent signs of potential deep vein thrombosis in her leg warrant urgent further investigation for PE  including diagnostic imaging and blood tests.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,28,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian female patient arrives at the hospital emergency department  presented with the sudden onset of shortness of breath  which has progressively become worse over the past few hours. She also mentions experiencing a sharp  piercing pain in her chest that becomes more intense when she tries to take deep breaths. The patient also feels faint and reports spells of lightheadedness.   Demographic Characterization: The patient is married and lives with her spouse in an urban setting. She is a retired teacher and reports her activity levels to be moderately low since her retirement  especially since the pandemic started. She doesn't smoke and drinks only socially. Her BMI is 26.5  which classifies her as slightly overweight.   Past Medical History: The patient had a major surgery 2 weeks prior  a total knee replacement surgery  following which she was minimally mobile. She also has a familial history of thrombotic events; her father and older brother both had deep vein thrombosis. The patient has a known status of hypertension and is under medication (Losartan 50 mg/day). She is also on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. She has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has been taking statins for the past five years.  Contextual Description: This patient profile presents an increased risk for acute pulmonary embolism  supported by several risk factors including recent surgery (which involved immobilization)  a family history of venous thromboembolic events  her age which presents a heightened risk for PE  her hormonal therapy  and her history of hypertension. She demonstrates danger symptoms including acute shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness. Considering these factors collectively  this patient should be evaluated immediately for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,29,Patient Representation:  Patient's ID: 123456 Age: 76 (as literature suggests  PE is more common among the elderly with a mean age around 70) Sex: Female (Acute pulmonary embolism is slightly more common in women) Ethnicity: White (while the disease affects people of all ethnicities  it is reportedly more common among Whites)  Residential address: Somewhere in USA (PE is a common complication among hospitalized patients in the US)  Occupational History: Retired Teacher (a stressful job emerging as a risk factor)  Social History: Non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumption  minimal exercise habits.  Family History: Mother died of stroke at 80  father of myocardial infarction at 76. Sister diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis.  Medical History: -Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: A significant risk factor for Pulmonary Embolism. -Previous Pulmonary Embolism: 3 years ago  resolved with treatment. Recurrence of PE is common. -Hypertension: Managed with medications. -Obesity: Body mass index (BMI) of 30 -Recent Surgery: Underwent hip replacement surgery 4 weeks ago.   -Osteoarthritis: Known case for the past 10 years.  -Postmenopausal Status: Increases risk due to loss of protective estrogen.  Drug History:  1. Warfarin for preventing clot formation owing to atrial fibrillation but was stopped before surgery. 2. Beta-blockers for hypertension. 3. Paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management in osteoarthritis.  Patient presenting complaint and symptoms:  Sudden onset of breathlessness  chest pain  syncope  increased heart rate  blood-tinged sputum.  Given the above features the patient falls into the high-risk group for pulmonary embolism. Due to a history of a recent immobility period after surgery  atrial fibrillation  and previous occurrences  the most probable initial diagnosis would be an acute pulmonary embolism. Further investigations like D-dimer  CT pulmonary angiography  and echocardiogram would be suggested to confirm the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,30,Problem Representation  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old overweight Caucasian male retired office worker with a BMI of 30  who had recently undergone an orthopedic surgery for his right hip.  Demographics: Based on literature  this patient fits into the typical profile for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) incidence as it has been found to be more common in the elderly population  with a mean age of incidence around 60 to 70 years old. Further  being male has been associated with slightly higher incidence rates  particularly for those with prior surgeries and sedentary lifestyles. The patient being Caucasian further aligns him with common demographic groups afflicted as PE is found to have higher prevalence in Caucasians than in other racial groups.    Chief Complaint:  He presents to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath  chest pain that's worsening with deep breaths  coughing up blood  and feeling lightheaded.  Past Medical History:  He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications. There's no history of smoking  alcohol or drug abuse. His mother had similar symptoms at age 72 which was later diagnosed as PE.   Recent History:  3 weeks ago  he had a hip replacement surgery. Following the operation  he was mainly bedridden and had minimum physical activities due in part to the painful recovery process.   Assessment:  Considering his recent lower extremity orthopedic surgery  immobilization  age  obesity  genetic predisposition  and his symptoms; the primary concern is an acute pulmonary embolism.   This representation is based on demographic data and risk factors found in literature. However  as always in medicine  patient individuality should be considered and thus the presented case may not be representative of all pulmonary embolism cases.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,31,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath and chest pain of two hours duration. The pain is sharp  localized in the anterior chest wall  and increases in intensity with deep breathing. The patient also reports a sense of impending doom.   Social History: The patient is widowed  lives alone  and has three adult children. She is a retired primary school teacher and a non-smoker. She does not consume alcohol or take illicit drugs. The patient is moderately active - she performs regular low-intensity exercises like walking.  Medical History: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis in her left leg two years ago. The thrombosis was managed with anticoagulant therapy for six months. She has been off medication since then. She also has a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient was also recently hospitalized due to a right hip fracture surgery after a fall  about three weeks ago. She reports compliance with all prescribed medications and exercises.  Family History: The patient's father died at 74 due to a myocardial infarction and her mother died at 78 with Alzheimer's. Her older sister had a history of recurrent pulmonary embolism.  Review of Systems: The patient admits to a recent unintentional weight loss of around 5kg over the past three months with decreased appetite. There is no history of fever  cough  or change in bowel habits.  Physical Examination: The patient appears anxious and mildly distressed on presentation. Vital signs show an elevated heart rate (110 bpm) and normal blood pressure (130/80 mmHg). Oxygen saturation on room air is 89%. Pulmonary auscultation reveals a tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes.  Given the patient's history of DVT  recent orthopedic surgery  family history of PE  vide the sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain  hemodynamic instability  and hypoxia  acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Immediate diagnostic tests and intervention to confirm and manage the pulmonary embolism are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,32,Problem Representation:  Primary Subject: John Doe  a hypothetical 60-year-old  non-Hispanic white male  a current smoker with a pack a day for the past 35 years  presenting with acute symptoms related to pulmonary embolism.  Demographic Characterization:  John Doe is a 60-year-old white male living in a suburban area. He has a bachelor’s degree and is employed full time. He lives with his spouse  and they have two adult children. John drinks alcohol moderately  roughly five drinks per week. John is clinically obese with a BMI of 31. He has a 35-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day and has had difficulty quitting  despite several attempts.  Past Medical History: John has hypertension  which he manages with medication. He was diagnosed with this ten years ago. Besides  he has moderate persistent asthma  which he also manages with combination therapy (inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists). He was first diagnosed with asthma at the age of 45  which is considered late-onset. The patient also has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) following a right knee replacement two years ago. Since then  he takes lifelong anticoagulant therapy.    Reason for Current Presentation: Over the past week  John has been experiencing shortness of breath (dyspnea) during minor physical activities  which previously didn't pose a problem. He also reports recurrent bouts of coughing that are often accompanied by blood-tinged sputum (hemoptysis). Further  he has recently noticed sharp chest pains (pleuritic chest pain) that become worse during deep breaths  eating  bending  or stooping but diminish when he leans forward or sits up. John also presents with symptoms related to potential right heart strain  including lower extremity swelling  dizziness  and a sense of impending doom (anxiety).   Given his symptomatology and past medical history  a strong suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism emerges  which necessitates prompt diagnostic evaluation and management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,33,Patient Profile:  - Demographics: A 65-year-old Caucasian female. - Past Medical History: She has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity nine years ago. She was treated with warfarin for one year following her DVT diagnosis but has not been on anticoagulant therapy since then. She also has a history of intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease and had an uncomplicated hysterectomy thirty years ago. Her latest lipid profile showed hypercholesterolemia for which she has been taking statin therapy. She doesn't smoke and is occasional alcohol drinker. - Family Medical History: Her father died of a pulmonary embolism at the age of 60 and her mother died of a stroke at the age of 75. Her older brother  aged 67  has a history of recurrent DVTs.   Problem Representation:  The presenting problem for this patient is acute pulmonary embolism. Given her past medical history of DVT  her genetic predisposition due to her family history  and her hypercholesterolemia  she is at high risk of pulmonary embolism. Research studies show that the incidence of pulmonary embolism is higher in older adults and in individuals with a family history of venous thromboembolism. Women experience a higher risk after menopause  which might be applicable to this patient considering her age and the fact that she had a hysterectomy which could lead to earlier menopause.   The vital signs of the patient  including heart rate  blood pressure  respiratory rate  and oxygen saturation  as well as her symptoms such as chest pain or difficulty breathing  will provide critical information for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of the embolism. It is also important to assess if she has lower extremity edema or pain which could indicate another DVT.   Diagnostic studies  including a D-dimer test  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) or ventilation perfusion scan  will confirm the diagnosis of the pulmonary embolism. The patient may also require an ultrasound of the lower extremities to search for a fresh DVT.   The patient will be at risk for future venous thromboembolism  owing to her age  family history of venous thromboembolism disorders  and previous occurrence of DVT. Therefore  long-term management should be focused on anticoagulation to prevent recurrent DVTs or pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,34,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographics: 60-year-old Caucasian woman - Occupation: Office worker  sedentary job - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  social drinker  low physical activity - Body Mass Index: 30 kg/m2  indicating obesity  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens upon deep breaths. She also mentions having a dry cough and feeling a bit faint. She rates her pain as 7/10 and mentions it feels like a sharp  stabbing pain.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago. - Taking oral contraceptives. - Positive family history for thromboembolic disease. Her father suffered a pulmonary embolism at age 65. - Hospitalisation for hip surgery a month ago. - Comorbidities include hypertension and type 2 diabetes. - Current medications include an antihypertensive drug  Metformin for diabetes  and a contraceptive pill.  This problem representation is built based on studies showing that pulmonary embolism (PE) is more common in older adults  in people with a sedentary lifestyle or obesity  and those with a history of DVT. The risk of PE is greater in individuals with a history of hospitalization for major surgery  personal or family history of thromboembolic disease  and in women taking oral contraceptives. The comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes add to the complexity of the clinical situation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,35,Problem Representation:  1. Patient Information:     - Demographics: A 67-year-old African American female    - Occupation: Retired school teacher    - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle  non-smoker  occasional alcohol usage.  2. Chief Complaint:     - The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths (pleuritic chest pain)  and a cough with hemoptysis.  3. Past Medical History:    - The patient has a documented history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  diagnosed two years ago.     - Chronic hypertension managed with antihypertensive medication.    - Patient underwent total knee replacement surgery 5 months ago.  4. Family History:    - Mother passed due to stroke  father had a heart condition.     - Sister with recurrent DVT and PE.     5. Medication History:    - The patient is currently on a daily dose of Lisinopril for hypertension.    - She was previously on anticoagulants following the DVT but stopped six months ago.  6. Physical Examination:    - The patient appears distressed due to difficulty breathing.    - Increased heart rate (tachycardia)  normal blood pressure.    - Decreased oxygen saturation level on room air.     According to literature  risk factors for acute pulmonary embolism include advanced age  African American race  previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  recent surgery  immobility  smoking  and a family history of VTE—all of which this patient has (except for smoking).   The high-risk factors in this patient are her history of DVT  recent orthopedic surgery  and the family history of recurrent DVT and PE. Also  the fact that the patient stopped her anticoagulation therapy six months ago places her at an increased risk. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,36,Patient Profile: John Doe  a 60-year-old white male  is presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain. He is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and is a former smoker. He does not have any known allergies.  Medical History: He has an existing diagnosis of hypertension that is being managed through a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. Mr. Doe also has a history of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) from three years ago  and has been on long term anti-coagulation therapy since. The patient's father had a history of cardiac conditions and his mother died of a stroke. He is sedentary and overweight  both of which increase his risk of venous thromboembolism.  Current Complaint: He reports sharp chest pain that worsens on deep breathing and slight lightheadedness. The shortness of breath began earlier this day  worsening over several hours  associated with some mild cough but no hemoptysis.   Highly Likely Diagnosis: Given his presentation and past medical history  acute pulmonary embolism is a strong possibility.   Justification: Middle-aged and elderly patients are at higher risk of developing Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  and males are shown to have a higher incidence of PE compared to females. Furthermore  hypertension and prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) like DVT are significant risk factors. Mr. Doe's sedentary lifestyle and overweight also contribute to this risk. His presentation with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and history of long-term anticoagulation therapy (suggesting history of conditions involving thrombosis) increase the suspicion for acute PE.  Future plan: He will be immediately assessed and stabilized. Diagnostic tests including but not limited to D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiogram  and possibly a V/Q scan will be conducted based on his condition. If confirmed  treatment for PE including re-initiation or revision of anti-coagulation therapy and necessary lifestyle modifications will be put in place.  This problem representation is constructed with consideration of accurate demographic representation as seen in the literature. PE is more common in older adults  with more incidence in men than women  and those with VTE history  as presented here with Mr. Doe. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,37,Patient Profile:  1. Demographic Details:    - Age: 65 years old    - Gender: Female    - Ethnicity: Caucasian    - Occupation: Retired    - Socio-economic Status: Middle income    - Geography: Urban dwelling  2. Past Medical History:    - History of deep vein thrombosis    - Underwent total knee replacement surgery 6 months ago    - Hypertension     - Hyperlipidemia   3. Other Relevant Information:    - Patient is a former smoker  quit 2 years ago    - Regular use of oral contraceptives till the age of 50    - Family history of thromboembolic disease    - BMI: 29 (Overweight)  Problem Representation:  This is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a history of deep vein thrombosis  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  knee replacement surgery  former smoking habit  and regular use of oral contraceptives  presents with acute pulmonary embolism. Her family history also suggests a predisposition to thromboembolic diseases. Given her profile and medical history  she is at a higher risk for recurrent embolic episodes. As an overweight individual having undergone recent surgery  her mobility might have been compromised  further predisposing to thromboembolic events. She also has other contributory risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia which might have implications towards her treatment course. Her past history of smoking  although she quit 2 years ago  may have contributed to her current pulmonary pathology.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,38,Patient Demographic and Background Information:  Sex: Female (slightly more common in females) Age: 60+ years old (most frequently confirmed in patients aged 60 years or older) Race: Caucasian (as per some studies  but PE has no racial predisposition) Occupation: Sedentary job or a job that requires long periods of immobility Lifestyle: Non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumption  Medical History:  1. Recent Surgery or Hospitalization: The patient underwent a hip replacement surgery around four weeks ago. Hospitalization or having had recent surgery  especially of the hip  knee  or lower abdomen are significant risk factors for PE.  2. History of VTE (Venous Thromboembolism): Patient had a confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago.   3. Cardiovascular Risks: The patient has a longstanding history of hypertension  currently well-controlled with medication.  4. Hormone Therapy: The patient is on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms  which is a known risk factor for PE.  5. Immobility: She also had a period of prolonged immobility following her hip surgery and due to her sedentary lifestyle.  6. Family History: Her father and brother had history of PE and DVT respectively  suggesting potential familial or hereditary thrombophilia.  7. Obesity: Patient has a BMI of 30 (obesity is a risk factor for PE).  8. No history of cancer or chronic lung diseases.   Problem Representation for Acute PE:  This 65-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of hypertension  recent hip replacement surgery  prolonged postoperative immobility  hormone replacement therapy  a past DVT episode  familial thromboembolic disease and with obesity  now presents with symptoms indicative of an acute PE such as sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and signs of increased heart rate and low oxygen levels based on initial examination.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,39,Problem Representation:  Patient Characterization: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female named Sarah. She has been living in an urban city in the United States. She is a retired school teacher and has been living alone since her husband passed away 5 years ago.   Health History: The patient has a medical history indicating a risk for blood clotting. Specifically  she underwent total hip arthroplasty 6 weeks ago  during which time she was immobilized and followed a treatment involving preoperative and postoperative prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. However  she discontinued the treatment two weeks after surgery.  She has had a high BMI throughout her adult life  currently classified as obese with a BMI of 32. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been managed with medication. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.   Recent Developments: The patient has recently been complaining of the sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness. She has also mentioned coughing up blood. These symptoms were not preceded by any apparent triggers and have been consistent over the past 2 days.  Clinical Examination: Physical examination reveals tachypnea and increased heart rate. She appears anxious and is experiencing difficulty speaking full sentences due to the shortness of breath. Her blood pressure has been on the lower side.  This clinical scenario raises the suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism  given her recent orthopedic surgery and signs of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These suspicions need to be confirmed with further diagnostic tests.  The patient’s age  female sex  obesity  recent surgery  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia increase her risk for developing a pulmonary embolism. It is important to note that the Caucasian population has higher rates of venous thromboembolism  including pulmonary embolism  as compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,40,Patient Problem Representation   Patient Information:   - Demographics: A Caucasian female  aged 68 - Occupation: Retired teacher - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  moderate alcohol use - BMI: 27  slightly overweight  Presenting Problem:   Patient is presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain especially upon breathing in  and light-headedness.  Medical History:  - High blood pressure managed with amlodipine - Type II diabetes managed with metformin - Former oral contraceptive user (stopped 25 years ago) - Previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) event 20 years ago - No history of cancer or major surgeries  Family History:   - Father died of myocardial infarction at 72  - Mother suffering from osteoporosis - Younger sister with clinically diagnosed similar pulmonary embolism years ago  Background of Problem:   The patient's history of DVT  hypertension  diabetes  past oral contraceptive use  and family history  places her in a higher risk category for acute pulmonary embolism (PE). As per literature  PE is more common among caucasians compared with African Americans or Asians (Horlander KT  Mannino DM  Leeper KV). In addition  PE risk increase with age  hence being 68 is also a risk factor (Douketis JD). Sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to the risk of blood clots.  Clinical Findings:  - Tachypnea (increased rate of respiration) - Tachycardia (increased heart rate) - S3 heart sound presence  - Lower-limb swelling  pain  redness and warmth  The combined clinical findings  medical history  and presenting symptoms give a strong indication towards acute pulmonary embolism.

History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg after a long-haul flight two years back  as the patient was on bed rest for 6 months from a fracture foot.     3. History of hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis     4. History of intermittent gastritis - Medications:     1. Amlodipine (10mg daily) for hypertension     2. Atorvastatin (20mg at bedtime) for hyperlipidemia     3. Alendronate (70mg weekly) for osteoporosis management     4. Pantoprazole (40mg daily) for gastritis - Allergies: No known drug allergies - Family history: Mother had pulmonary embolism in her late 60s  father had a history of stroke.   Presentation: The patient presents with acute onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  productive cough with frothy sputum and palpitation which started few hours ago. Examination findings included tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and a drop in oxygen saturation (92%) on room air.   Problem representation: A 70-year-old Caucasian female patient with a significant medical history of hypertension  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis is presenting with acute onset of symptoms - chest pain  dyspnea and frothy sputum  which may suggest an acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  given her history of a previous DVT and the presentation of her symptoms. The patient's family history of PE also raises suspicion. A comprehensive diagnostic work-up is indicated for this patient to confirm the presence of a pulmonary embolism and to manage this life-threatening condition promptly.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,43,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: A 60-year-old  Caucasian female  currently working as a high school teacher.  Presenting problem: She presents to the ER with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain which worsens during deep breaths  lightheadedness  and palpitations for the past five hours.  Relevant Medical History: The patient is obese with a BMI of 34  diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) a few months ago for which she does not consistently take wraparound medical compression stockings or oral anticoagulants as recommended. She has been on oral contraceptive pills for menopausal symptoms for the past two years. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She has no known allergies.   Family medical history: Her father suffered from a stroke in his late sixties and her mother had peripheral artery disease. There is no known family history of genetic thrombophilic disorders.  Relevant social history: The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and her job involves long periods of sitting. She recently had a long haul flight about ten days back  after a vacation.  Conclusion: Given her history of DVT  obesity  usage of contraceptive pills  recent prolonged travel  presenting symptoms  and her demographic profile (being a 60 year old female)  there are several potential risk factors pointing towards a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate diagnostic tests such as D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiography  or a lung ventilation/perfusion scan should be considered for confirmation and immediate treatment should be initiated to reduce the risk of serious complications.   (Note: The key details of this report  including the patient's demographic information  symptoms  and medical history  have been collated based on generalizations.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,48,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian woman.  Presenting Complaint: She presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  rapid heart rate  and lightheadedness. These symptoms were unexpected and started while at home  with no apparent trigger. She rates her shortness of breath as 10/10 and chest pain as 7/10 on the pain scale.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of long flights (been on a long-haul flight 5 days ago to visit her kids)  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which was successfully treated with anticoagulant therapy about a year ago. She has been compliant with her DVT medications until about six months ago when she self-discontinued it. She also has a high BMI contributing to a sedentary lifestyle. She has a 30-pack year smoking history but quit smoking ten years ago. The patient has no known drug allergies.   Family Medical History: Her family history reveals that her mother died of myocardial infarction at 67 and her father passed away due to stroke. Her older sister is suffering from hypertension.  Drugs & Allergies: She is not taking any regular medication currently. She took anticoagulant therapy (Rivaroxaban) a year ago for DVT. No known drug allergies.  Social History: She lives alone and is retired. She quit smoking ten years ago. She doesn't consume alcohol. She performs light exercises like walking in the park. She has three daughters living out of state who visit her once in a while.   Summary: 65-year-old woman with a history of DVT not on anticoagulant therapy  recent long-haul flight  high BMI  and smoking presents with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain  which are classic symptoms of a pulmonary embolism. Given her history of DVT  recent long flight travel  and her symptoms  a pulmonary embolism could be a potential diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,49,Patient Representation:  Male  Aged 68 years  African American   Presenting Complaint: Sudden and severe shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or coughing  cough with bloody sputum  profuse sweating  and fainting.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis in the right leg  suffered three years ago. He is also diagnosed with high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  chronic atrial fibrillation  and obesity BMI>35. He is a pack-a-day smoker for forty years and a social drinker. He had a hip replacement surgery six months ago.  Family History: The patient's father died from a stroke at early seventies and mother of complications related to type II diabetes. He has a younger sister with breast cancer. No known family history of pulmonary embolism  blood clot disorders or genetic disorders.  Recent History: The patient spent a long trans-Atlantic flight and had been recovering from a severe cold. He also reports being less active recently following his hip surgery.  Current Medication: Anticoagulant medication (warfarin) since his last DVT  statins for controlling cholesterol  and daily aspirin.   This patient's profile mimics a typical case for acute pulmonary embolism  based on the information available in literature. His genetic and personal behavioral characteristics (race  age  smoking history  obesity  recent immobility)  previous health conditions (DVT  atrial fibrillation  hypertension  surgery) and recent activities (long flight) are all associated risk factors for pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,50,Patient Representation:  - Demographics: A 65-year-old Caucasian female. - Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) for which she takes anticoagulation medication (warfarin). She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was a lifelong smoker until quitting ten years ago. She had a right total hip replacement two years ago. She is obese with a BMI of 35  and has peripheral artery disease. - Presentation: The patient presents to the ED with acute onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and palpitations. These symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past few hours. - Vital Signs: On examination  she appears acutely ill  with increased respiratory rate and is hypoxic with oxygen saturation on room air at 88%. Heart rate is elevated. - Risk Factors: The patient's primary risk factors for pulmonary embolism include her chronic A-Fib  recent surgery  obesity  past smoking habit and peripheral artery disease.  The above profile reflects the data found in literature for typical patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism. According to the American Heart Association  the incidence of pulmonary embolism is often higher in middle-aged and older adults  particularly over 60 years. Moreover  conditions that slow blood flow  such as atrial fibrillation  surgery  obesity  long periods of immobility  certain cancers and smoking increase the risk. Lung diseases  such as COPD  can enhance the severity of a pulmonary embolism episode.  Relevant past medical history  like any surgery in the past three months  history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism  COPD and history of smoking is also included as these are common risk factors. Her elevated heart rate  hypoxia  and the acute onset and progressive nature of her symptoms are the common clinical signs of acute pulmonary embolism as described in several case studies and clinical literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,51,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Davis Wilson   Age: 52 years   Gender: Male   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Occupation: Office Worker    Presenting Problem: Mr. Davis Wilson presented at the ER complaining of sharp  stabbing chest pain worsening with deep breaths  a dry cough  and shortness of breath. He also reported experiencing a light-headed feeling and fainting once at home.  Medical History: The patient is a smoker with a 30-pack-year history and has been struggling with obesity for the past 15 years. His BMI is 32. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 5 years ago  for which he is on medication. The patient had a total knee replacement 2 weeks ago. He mentions a family history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Hospital and Drug History: Mr. Wilson was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for his knee replacement. Post-operatively  despite being prescribed low molecular weight heparin for prevention  the patient admits that he did not use the prophylaxis as directed. He has been on amlodipine (10mg/day) and atorvastatin (20mg/day) for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Social History: The patient has a sedentary lifestyle and is a heavy smoker. He drinks alcohol occasionally. Mr. Wilson states he has been under significant stress at work recently.  Presentation Conclusion: Given his recent surgery  history of hypertension  smoking  and obesity  the patient's clinical symptoms are suggestive of a possible acute pulmonary embolism picture. The cessation of use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin also correlates with an elevated risk of pulmonary embolism.  This characterization falls in line with the demographic representation found in literature - patients with pulmonary embolism are often middle-aged with significant risk factors including obesity  smoking  recent surgery  lack of mobility  and oral contraceptive use. Men are slightly more affected than women  and an increased risk is also associated with certain genetic or inherited conditions  like blood clotting disorders.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,52,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characterization:   A 55-year-old Caucasian female patient  non-smoker  with BMI of 27  employed as an office manager  living in suburban United States. She lives with her husband and has two adult children. The patient has an average socioeconomic status and follows good diet habits. She has a history of occasional alcohol consumption and does not engage in regular physical exercises.   Relevant Past Medical History:  This patient has a significant past medical history which includes conditions like hypertension (managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (controlled with metformin and dietary adjustments).   She has a family history of deep vein thrombosis in her father and paternal grandmother. Four years back  she underwent a total hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids  after which she started hormone replacement therapy. She has been taking estrogen replacement therapy since then  which increases her predisposition to clot formation.   No known drug allergies or previous history of surgery apart from the uterine surgery.   Current Presentation:  She presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain with a positive modified Wells’ score indicating a high probability of pulmonary embolism. She also had symptoms of light-headedness and a brief episode of syncope  but no reported fever  cough  or hemoptysis.   This clinical presentation and the patient's demographic profile and past medical history suggest a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. This hypothesis will need to be confirmed with further investigations like D-dimer  compression ultrasound  computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) etc.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,53,Patient Representation:  Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female  presenting with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  increased shortness of breath  and light-headedness. According to a recent poll by the National Institute of Health  the mean age of patients presenting with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) is approximately 60 years  with slightly more prevalence in females.   Her medical history plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment process. She has a known history of hypercoagulable states  which significantly increases her chances of suffering from APE. Her past medical history includes:  1. Known case of Factor V Leiden mutation  an inherited blood clotting disorder. This is the most common genetic risk factor for developing blood clots  including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).  2. She was on oral contraceptives for the past 20 years  intensifying her risk factor due to long-term usage of estrogen-including medications.  3. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. Post-surgery  patients are often bedridden increasing the risk of DVT  leading to PE.  4. Known history of chronic hypertension along with hyperlipidemia.  The patient is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  and doesn't have any known drug allergies. She leads a sedentary lifestyle and doesn't engage in regular physical activity. Her family history includes her father having a stroke at age 65 and her mother having breast cancer at age 60.   Given her presenting symptoms  her past medical history  and her lifestyle  the likelihood of an acute pulmonary embolism is quite high  and immediate diagnostic tests and interventions must be undertaken.   It's essential to take into account not only her current symptoms and vital signs but also consider her entire medical history and lifestyle habits  including genetic predispositions and potential risks associated with long-term medication usage and surgical history.

The patient reported a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right lower leg seven years ago following a Transatlantic airplane flight  and she has been taking low-dose Aspirin since then for prevention of recurrence. She has had no surgeries or hospitalizations since her DVT event.  **Family History:**  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  including her father who died of a heart attack at the age of 60  and her mother who suffered from recurrent venous thromboembolism events and passed away from stroke at the age of 68.  **Sociocultural Profile:**  She is a widow who lives alone. She adheres to her religious (Christian) practices and enjoys reading and volunteering at her local community center. She expresses that she has been experiencing increased stress levels at work which have been affecting her sleep in the past few months. She rarely exercises and reports a diet prevalent in processed foods due to her busy lifestyle.     **Demographic Considerations:**  The aforementioned patient profile fits the general demographic characterization of patients who present with acute pulmonary embolism. The risk factors including age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  history of DVT  family history of cardiovascular diseases  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes contribute to the typical profile of a person who can develop such a condition.   Furthermore  the fact that she is an African American woman also increases her risk  as evidence has demonstrated higher incidence and mortality rates of pulmonary embolism within these groups. The history of venous thromboembolism in the family implies a potential underlying genetic predisposition such as Thrombophilia.  **References:**  1.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,55,Patient Problem Representation:  Demographics: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29. She is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but smoked for over 25 years. She worked as a secretary until her retirement five years ago. She has a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in consistent physical exercise.   Chief Complaint: She presents at the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath that has developed over the past three days. She also reports experiencing acute chest pain that worsened with deep breaths.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 12 years ago) and hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago); both conditions are managed with medication. She was hospitalized for an elective hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. Postoperatively  she was not prescribed prophylactic anticoagulation due to the low-risk nature of her surgery and her surgeon's assessment of her overall health status. She also has a history of intermittent leg swelling diagnosed as a varicose vein two years prior.  Family History: The patient’s mother had a pulmonary embolism in her early seventies. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67. She has two older brothers  both of whom have been diagnosed with high blood pressure.  Social History: She is currently single and lives alone in a second-floor apartment. After her hip replacement surgery  she minimized her physical activities due to postoperative pain. She does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs.  Review of Symptoms: The patient also admitted to recent fatigue  light-headedness  and a fainting episode at home. She denies fever  cough  or hemoptysis.  This representation pertains to a typical patient with demographic characteristics and clinical features often associated with an elevated risk of Pulmonary Embolism  including advanced age  recent surgery  prolonged immobilization  history of tobacco use  obesity  and chronic medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension. The medical history  symptoms  and demographic data point towards a high possibility of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,56,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 65-year-old  Caucasian female presents to the emergency department.  Presenting Complaint:  She reports sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that began while performing her daily household chores. The pain is sharp  increases with deep breathing and is located in the right side of the chest. It is not radiating and is not associated with nausea or sweating.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a history of long-distance air travel about two weeks ago. Her past medical history is significant for obesity (BMI: 32 Kg/m^2)  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a recent total hip replacement surgery 1 month ago. She is a non-smoker and lives a sedentary lifestyle. She takes metformin for her diabetes and was on post-operative prophylactic treatment with low molecular weight heparin which she stopped two weeks ago. There is a family history of thrombosis in her older sister.   Demographic Data: The prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism is 60-70 cases per 100 000 persons per year. It is slightly more prevalent in Caucasians compared to other ethnic groups. Females are at a slightly higher risk than males during reproductive years  but the incidence equalizes in older age groups. Older age  obesity  recent surgery  long-distance travel  use of oral contraceptives  underlying malignancies  prolonged immobilization (bed rest or sedentary lifestyle)  family history of thrombosis  and history of thromboembolic diseases are known risk factors.  This problem representation indicates a high suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism based on the patient's demographic and clinical characteristics. Her major risk factors include recent surgery  long-distance travel  obesity  and a positive family history.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,57,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Demographics: A 65-year-old African American woman. 2. Socio-Economic Status: Mid income  with full medical insurance coverage. 3. Employment Status: Retired teacher. 4. Living Situation: Lives alone in a suburban neighborhood.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain which gets worse with deep breathing  and cough with bloody sputum. She mentioned feeling lightheaded  and is also experiencing rapid heart rate.  Prior Medical History: 1. Chronic Diseases: Patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. Surgical History: She underwent a right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis two weeks prior. 3. Medication: She is on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril) and oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin) and was discharged with anticoagulant prophylaxis (enoxaparin) after her surgery. 4. Behavioral History: She is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. She reports modest consumption of alcohol (1-2 drinks per week). She has a sedentary lifestyle. 5. Genetics: She mentioned a family history of deep vein thrombosis in her mother.  Relevant Lifestyle Factors: The patient takes her medication regularly and follows a balanced diet. However  she stated that she couldn't move often due to the recent surgery. She follows up regularly for her chronic conditions.  In this scenario  the key factors of concern are her recent surgery  her sedentary lifestyle  and her family's history of blood clots. Given her age and ethnicity  she is at increased risk for a pulmonary embolism  and her symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.  NOTE: An understanding of the patient's past and current health situation assists healthcare providers in accurately diagnosing health problems and planning treatment modalities. Moreover  it also helps in predicting possible health outcomes and adopting preventive measures.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,58,Patient Profile: Name: Jane Doe  Age: 60 years old Race: Caucasian Gender: Female Occupation: retired school teacher Place of Residence: Urban area  Health Insurance: Medicare   Cultural/Social Background:  Jane is a retired school teacher  divorced with two adult children residing in different states. She is non-smoker  moderate drinker of alcohol and has a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). She lives alone and does a fair amount of walking for her daily activities.  Presenting Problem:  Jane presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and a feeling of faintness.  Past Medical History:  Jane is known to have Hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago. In addition  she is also on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for her postmenopausal status. She suffered a DVT following a long-distance plane ride 3 years ago  for which she was on anticoagulant therapy for 6 months.   Relevant Family History:  Her father died at the age of 68 of PE and her sister  62 years old  was recently diagnosed with DVT.  Current Medications:  Metformin  Lisinopril  and Hormone Replacement Therapy (Estrogen)  Demographics:  These demographics corresponds to those found in a study in American Journal of Medicine which found that PE is more prevalent in the elderly  and white race tends to have higher rates. Moreover  women exposed to HRT have a higher likelihood of developing venous thromboembolism  including PE. The risk is further compounded for individuals with previous history of venous thromboembolism.   Initial Differential Diagnosis:  Acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  Myocardial Infarction  Pneumonia  Anxiety  Pneumothorax.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,59,Patient Representation:  Gender: Female Age: 67 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Education: Bachelor's degree Residential area: Urban Marital Status: Widowed Living Situation: Living alone  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 10 years  under control with medication  - Hyperlipidemia managed with statin therapy  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 2 years ago  managed with anticoagulant therapy but discontinued after 6 months  - Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago) - Occasional alcohol consumer (2 drinks per week)  The above representation is based on common patterns seen in research. According to literature  embolism tends to be more common in elderly individuals (ages 60-79) than in younger populations. Women have slightly higher rates of PE than men  especially in older age groups. Lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol can also contribute to the risk of developing an embolism. Factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous history of DVT are known risk factors for pulmonary embolism.   Primary Presentation: The patient presents with sudden onset of dyspnea (difficulty breathing)  sharp chest pain  and cough. These symptoms worsen with physical activity. The patient also reports dizziness  light-headedness  rapid heart rate  and sweating. Upon auscultation  the breath sounds are reduced and heart sounds are fast. Peripheral oxygen saturation is below normal range.   These symptoms line up with the classic presentation of a pulmonary embolism  prompting immediate further investigation and management to reduce the risk of mortality and severe complications.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,60,Patient Profile: Patient M.M. is a Caucasian woman  aged 55  residing in a suburban area in the United States. She presents with sudden onset shortness of breath and an increased heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Upon auscultation  the lungs are clear. Her blood pressure is within normal ranges  but the oxygen saturation is slightly low at 92% in room air. Her initial EKG reveals a sinus tachycardia without any apparent ST-segment changes. She holds a nine-to-five desk job with an IT company and cites prolonged sitting as a part of her work schedule. She occasionally travels internationally for work. Patient M.M. also reveals a somewhat sedentary lifestyle otherwise due to increased work pressure in the recent past. She is a former smoker  having given up smoking eight years ago.   Past Medical History: Patient M.M.’s BMI is 29 which classifies her as being in the overweight category. She also has a past medical history of systemic hypertension for ten years and has been taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for control. She had undergone hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for a period of one year  about two years back. She has no history of any surgical procedures.  Family History: Her mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis in her late fifties  and her paternal grandmother had suffered from a stroke in her sixties. There's no family history of lung diseases or genetic disorders.  Current Medications: Amlodipine 5mg Daily Multivitamin daily  Presentation: Considering the patient's profile  presenting symptoms  past medical history  medication history  and family history  there is a reasonable suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. The combination of her sedentary lifestyle  her past hormone replacement therapy  and familial history of thrombotic events should alert the care team about the possibility of this critical condition. The next recommended step is to verify the hypotheses with objective diagnostics  like a D-dimer test  chest CT angiography  or a V/Q scan  depending on availability and patient's specific conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,61,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old African American female patient  presenting symptoms of sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  cough  and syncope. She has been experiencing discomfort for the past 72 hours. Family history indicates a maternal lineage with a history of blood clots.  Demographics:  - Age: 60 years  - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: African American  Past Medical History:  - Obesity: Her BMI is calculated at 35  - Hypertension: Diagnosed five years ago  being controlled with medication  - Type 2 Diabetes: Diagnosed seven years ago  moderately controlled with Metformin  - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed one year ago  being managed with diet and lifestyle changes - No history of surgery - No history of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis - Smoker with 20-pack-year history - Not pregnant and no past record of pregnancy - Family history of blood clots  Presenting Symptoms:  - Acute onset Shortness of breath  - Chest pain - Cough - Syncope  Potential Risk Factors:  - Age over 60  - Sedentary lifestyle  - Obesity  - Hypertension  - Type 2 Diabetes  - Hyperlipidemia  - Smoking  - Family history of blood clots  Relevant Social Factors:  - Lives alone and retired  having limited physical activities - Limited access to healthcare due to living in a rurally isolated area - Smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day  Current Hypothesis:  Given the patient's complaint of sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  cough  and syncope - along with presence of known risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  diabetes  age  and smoking habit - there is a considerable clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Confirmation of the diagnosis shall require further diagnostic investigations.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,62,Patient data:  Gender: Female Age: 66 years old Race: Caucasian  Previous Medical History:  1. Hypertension – Diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled using Amlodipine 2. Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus – Diagnosed 8 years ago  on treatment with Metformin 3. Recent Hospitalization – Hospitalized due to Left femur fracture (3 weeks ago) 4. Obesity – Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.5 kg/m^2  5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) – Diagnosed and treated 5 years ago 6. Family History of Venous Thromboembolism  Demographics and medical history given above are justified with evidence. According to literature  the prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is around 60 per 100 000 population annually. Women are slightly less likely to have PE  although the female to male ratio is close to 1. Age is a risk factor for PE with a incidence doubling with each decade after 60 years of age (Torbicki et al.  2008). Caucasians have a higher risk compared to other ethnic groups. Risk is also higher among patients with obesity and those with prior DVT or PE. Recent hospitalization especially for fracture or surgery  use of birth control pills  cancer  smoking  and a family history of DVT or PE are other significant risk factors (Tapson  2008). Comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes are common among PE patients (Cushman  2007).
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,63,Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents at the emergency department.   Demographics: Age: Older adults. (65 years in this case) Gender: Male. Race: Caucasian. Occupation: Retired engineer. Location: Lives alone in a suburban area.  Presenting Complaint:  Complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain which is aggravated on deep breathing  a mild cough with traces of blood  a feeling of faintness  rapid heart rate  and bluish skin color (cyanosis).  Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension managed with Lisinopril  past smoker for 30 years but quit 5 years ago  a family history of blood clotting disorders with his father having experienced deep vein thrombosis. Has been relatively inactive in his lifestyle since retirement. No known allergies. No history of similar symptoms in the past.  Recent History:  He has just returned from a transcontinental flight 2 days ago. Has been observing a healthy diet to keep cholesterol and blood pressure levels in check but physical activity limited mostly to household chores.  Review of Systems: Cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms as mentioned before. No other systems seem to have any abnormalities.  Current Medications: Lisinopril 20mg once daily for hypertension.  Relevant Labs and Investigations:  According to the clinical presentation  Mr. Johnson is sent to have an urgent CT Pulmonary Angiography to confirm or rule out the suspicion of a Pulmonary embolism.   In literature  the typical patient presenting with acute pulmonary embolism is an older adult  often Caucasian  with past medical history significant for hypertension  family history of blood clotting disorders  and other risk factors like sedentary lifestyle  recent long travel  among others. Normally  the patient's symptoms  vital signals and other clinical findings  complete the characterization of the case.   Problem Representation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  smoking  and familial thrombotic events  post a long-haul flight presents with acute onset chest pain  hemoptysis  dyspnea  tachycardia and cyanosis suggestive of acute Pulmonary Embolism. The patient needs an immediate diagnostic workup  including a CT Pulmonary Angiography to rule in or out Pulmonary Embolism  and treatment should be initiated as deemed appropriate based on findings. His other risk factors should be addressed as a part of overall management and preventive strategy for future.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,64,Problem Representation:   Patient profile: A 65-year-old obese  African American female with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis and hypertension  who recently underwent a total hip replacement surgery.  Presenting Problem: The patient has been experiencing progressive shortness of breath  sharp chest pain exacerbated on deep inspiration  episodes of fainting  rapid heart rate  and leg swelling over the past three days.   The patient used to smoke  but quit 10 years ago. She denies poor appetite  weight loss  cough  sputum production  history of exposure to tuberculosis  or recent travels.  Medications: Warfarin for deep vein thrombosis  Lisinopril for hypertension.  Family History: Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 70. Her father had coronary artery disease and died in his 80's. One sister has type 2 diabetes  and one brother has hypertension.  The occupational history states that the patient is retired and lives alone. She has a caregiver who visits daily to help with basic tasks and daily medications.  Physical Examination: On examination  she looks distressed  and her vital signs show tachypnea  tachycardia  and low oxygen saturation on room air. Auscultation reveals reduced breath sounds on lower lung lobes bilaterally. An arterial blood gas analysis indicates hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. Her lower extremities show edema and warmth  suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.  Based on this problem representation  the patient has several risk factors for pulmonary embolism including age  obesity  recent hip surgery  and a history of deep vein thrombosis. The presenting symptoms alongside physical examination findings and the past medical history seem highly suggestive of a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   The patient should be managed as a medical emergency and should undergo diagnostic tests as soon as possible including D-dimer assay  computed tomography pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan  if possible. Her anticoagulation therapy should also be reassessed.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,65,"Problem Presentation:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint: Complains of recent onset sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  History of Present Illness:  Reports that symptoms started 3 hours ago  while at rest  and have progressively worsened. Describes her chest pain as """"sharp"""" and """"stabbing """" that gets worse when she takes a deep breath. She also mentioned that she feels lightheaded and has been feeling unusually fatigued in the past week.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed 2 years ago and was on anticoagulation  which was discontinued six months ago. She also has hypertension controlled with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. She reports no surgeries or hospitalizations in the past.   Family History: Mother died of stroke at 74  father died of a heart attack at 70. Patient has one older brother  age 67  with a history of DVT.  Social History: The patient is a retired teacher; she lives with her husband and reports occasional alcohol consumption  but she has never smoked. She is largely sedentary but takes a water aerobics class twice a week.  Medications: Amlodipine 5mg daily  hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily.  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Review of Systems: Aside from her chest pain and shortness of breath  patient denies cough  fever  leg pain or swelling  recent long-distance travel  recent surgeries or any other symptoms of note.  Given the demographic representation  including age  gender  personal and family history of DVT  and the symptoms of sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath  there is a high index of clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,66,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographic information:    - The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female.   - She is a former smoker  quit smoking about 15 years ago (common in about 15-24% of cases).    - Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 32.1  which classifies her as obese (36%~ of patients are obese).    - She retired recently  and her daily activities have significantly reduced.   - Lives alone  has assisted home care to manage day-to-day life.  Past Medical History: - Significant past medical history (more common in roughly 78% of PE patients):   - She has a history of hypertension controlled with medication.   - Previously diagnosed with elevated blood cholesterol managed with statins. - Incidents of DVT:   - 3 years ago  the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post her left knee replacement surgery (28%-44% of patients have a history of DVT).   - She had received anticoagulation therapy for the DVT but currently is not on anticoagulants. - Ongoing low-dose hormone therapy for postmenopausal symptoms.  Family history: - Her father had an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 64. - Her mother had a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and died due to a massive stroke.  Presenting Complaints: - She presents with sudden onset intercostal chest pain  which is pleuritic in nature (68% of patients). - Reports of sudden onset shortness of breath or dyspnea that progressively worsens (reported by up to 82% patients). - She also has an unexplained cough  but without hemoptysis. - No recent history of travel  surgery  trauma  or immobilization.  Physical Findings: - The patient appears uncomfortable due to dyspnea. - Vital signs: Blood pressure is 136/85 mmHg  heart rate is 112 beats/min  temperature is 37.1 degrees C  respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation on room air is 94%. - Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are significant for tachycardia and tachypnea with clear bilateral lung fields. - No leg swelling  redness or tenderness  which rules out evident signs of DVT. - No cyanosis  distended neck veins  or other signs of cor pulmonale.  Given the nature of the disease and associated risk factors  this demographic and health history outline embodies a high-risk older adult patient who exhibits classic symptoms of a pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic testing is required to confirm the suspicion and initiate appropriate treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,67,**Problem Representation**  Demographics: Patient Name: Mrs. Wakefield Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Habits: Non-smoker  social drinker Occupation: Retired teacher  Past medical history:  Mrs. Wakefield has a history of varicose veins and had a knee replacement surgery one month ago. She has been relatively sedentary since her surgery. She is positive for Factor V Leiden mutation which makes her predisposed to developing blood clots. She also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She takes daily medication for these conditions including a beta-blocker and a statin.  Her prior surgical history  aside from the recent knee replacement  includes a hysterectomy in her mid-40s. She also has a past medical history of hypothyroidism for which she is on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  She has mild asthma  which is well-controlled with the use of an inhaler.   Recent development: Upon arrival at the ER  Mrs Wakefield reported experiencing sudden onset of breathlessness  chest pain and lightheadedness. These symptoms started suddenly a few hours earlier and have been progressively getting worse. She has no known allergies.  Based on these symptoms and her risk factors including recent surgery  Factor V Leiden mutation  and sedentary lifestyle  the attending physician immediately suspects an acute pulmonary embolism.   The physician orders a CT angiogram of the thorax to confirm the diagnosis and guides the treatment decision-making. In this scenario  the PE would most likely be due to a blood clot that originated in the deep veins of her leg post knee replacement surgery and travelled up to the lung. This condition may lead to severe complications if not treated promptly.   References: Kearon C  Akl EA  Ornelas J  et al.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,68,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently retired. She is a non-smoker and has an average alcohol intake. She resides in urban surroundings living alone. As per literature demographics  the average age for pulmonary embolism patients is about 60 years and with a roughly equal gender distribution.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hormone replacement therapy which significantly increases her risk of developing a blood clot. She had total knee replacement surgery two months ago. Recent surgery  particularly orthopedic surgical procedures are known major risk factors for pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a history of various thrombophilias  hyperhomocysteinemia  and familial history of myocardial infarction. She was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 7 years ago.  Prescription History:  For her hypertension  she takes Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She is on Atorvastatin for her hyperlipidemia. Low dose Aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events was also started.  After her knee surgery  she was given a course of prophylactic anticoagulants to prevent blood clots  but she completed the therapy a month ago.  Risk Factor:  Age  history of surgery  immobilization  prescribed drugs  genetic factors  overweight and lifestyle factors are some of the known risk factors for pulmonary embolism.  Presentation:  The patient presents in the clinic with sudden onset of shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain and obscure cough; a typical presentation for a patient with acute pulmonary embolism. Occasionally  she also emits bloody sputum. These symptoms at times make her anxious and dizzy.   Considering all her symptoms and her risk factors  she has an established diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism and would immediately require medical attention. This potentially life-threatening condition could turn fatal if not promptly diagnosed and treated.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,69,Patient Profile:   1. Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired and lives alone in a suburban environment. He is a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption.  2. Past Medical History (PMH):  The patient has a significant PMH of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT  events occurred about 5 years and 3 years ago) and hypertension (HTN  since the age of 54). He had a total knee replacement 9 months ago due to osteoarthritis. As a result of his previous DVT episodes  the patient has been on Rivaroxaban as prophylaxis for DVT. His HTN has been controlled orally with Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also has a history of Pancreatic cancer  for which he underwent a Whipple procedure about 10 years ago; the cancer is currently in remission.  Problem List:  1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE):  The patient presents symptoms of acute PE  such as sudden-shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that worsens with a deep breath  and cough with bloody sputum.  2. Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):  The patient has a history of DVT  as he has experienced two significant events in the past five years.   3. Hypertension (HTN):  The patient continues to manage his HTN  which has required medication since he was diagnosed at age 54.  4. Post-Total Knee Replacement: The patient underwent total knee replacement surgery 9 months ago due to osteoarthritis.  5. History of Pancreatic Cancer:  The patient had pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure about 10 years ago. The cancer is presently in remission.  6. Risk Factors:  The patient is of older age  has a history of recurrent DVT  underwent recent major surgery (Total Knee Replacement)  and has been in a sedentary state. All these are classical risk factors associated with the development of an acute PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,70,Problem Representation:  Demographics: Patient is of middle age (mean age of patients with PE is typically 60-65 years)  with a slight female predominance as suggested by some studies. The ethnicity varies but recent literature points to a higher incidence among African Americans.  Chief Complaint: Patient arrived in the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp chest pain which worsens upon taking a deep breath. Patient may also manifest signs of anxiety and palpitations.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  one of the most common causes of pulmonary embolism. They may also showing past medical records of chronic atrial fibrillation  with inconsistent anticoagulation control. The patient underwent a recent major surgery (e.g.  joint replacement  abdominal/pelvic surgery) 2 weeks ago. Additionally  the patient has been on cancer treatments (chemotherapeutic agents or hormonal therapy) for breast cancer for the past 6 months. The patient also took a long-haul flight recently.  Family history: Patient reports history of PE or DVT in a first-degree relative.   Social History: Patient is a retired professional who volunteers at a local community center 3 times a week. Patient is an active smoker with a 30 pack-year history. The patient's BMI indicates obesity.  Medications: Current medications include a hormone replacement therapy for managing postmenopausal symptoms and the occasional use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis pain.  Other relevant information: The patient may indicate associated symptoms of PE such as a cough producing blood-streaked sputum  light-headedness or even fainting spells.  Patient has no known drug allergies. The routine patient assessment may reveal signs of PE or DVT such as swelling  warmth  and redness in a limb. On auscultation  tachycardia or abnormal heart sounds may be noted. Blood pressure might be lower than normal.  By combining this information  healthcare providers can determine the present risk of PE  rule out other differential diagnoses  and decide on the necessary diagnostic steps and treatment approach which typically includes immediate anticoagulation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,71,Patient Profile  The patient is a 65-year-old African American female with a body mass index (BMI) of 28  who is a current smoker. She lives in an urban setting  is widowed  and lives alone  leading a sedentary lifestyle. She has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago which is currently managed with oral antidiabetic medications. She also has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a hip replacement surgery 10 years ago. The patient has been admitted to the emergency department presenting with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism.  Problem Representation  Chief Complaint: The patient arrived with sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp chest pain that was worsening with deep breathing  and a fainting episode she experienced today morning.  Past medical history: The significant past history includes hypertension  diabetes  history of DVT post-hip replacement surgery  and smoking.   Medications: She is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension  Metformin for diabetes  and has not been on any anticoagulant since her DVT episode.  Risk Factors: High risk factors in this patient for PE include advanced age  African American race  obesity  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  history of DVT  hypertension  and diabetes.  Symptoms: Acute dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and syncope.  This patient representation is consistent with the demographic and clinical characteristics found in literature for patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Most patients are older adults  and women have a slightly higher incidence than men. African Americans have higher incidence rates than other racial groups. Risk factors include prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  and certain chronic illnesses like hypertension and diabetes. The most common symptoms of PE are sudden-onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and syncope. Moreover  post-operative status (like post-orthopedic surgery) is a known risk factor for DVT which could potentially lead to PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,72,Problem Representation:  Patient Case:  A 62-year-old Caucasian female presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and palpitations since morning. She reports dizziness and light-headedness but denies nausea  vomiting  cough  or recent travel. She has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medications. No known allergies reported. The patient has a 40 pack year smoking history  and her mother suffered from recurrent venous thromboembolisms. She leads a sedentary lifestyle  post retirement from her office job where she had extended hours of sitting.  Disease Etiology:  Risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) in this patient include advanced age (increases after the age of 60)  female sex  smoking history  personal history of hypertension & hyperlipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  family history of venous thromboembolism  and genetic predisposition for developing thrombosis. The most common symptom of PE which is dyspnea is observed in her presentation. The pleuritic chest pain and palpitations further support the possible diagnosis of PE.  Disease Course:  If the diagnosis of PE is confirmed and left untreated  it can lead to right heart failure (known as cor pulmonale)  due to increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs. PE is a life-threatening condition and immediate intervention with systemic anticoagulation is essential to avoid serious complication or death.  Treatment:  The mainstay of treatment includes anticoagulation  thrombolytics in certain patients  like those with low blood pressure or those who are seriously ill due to PE. Measures to prevent further thrombosis include encouraging patient to quit smoking and lead a more active lifestyle. Regular follow-up with the doctor to monitor anticoagulation therapy  manage hypertension and hyperlipidemia effectively is also essential.   Follow-up:  The patient would require long-term follow-up with a healthcare provider with periodic testing to assess the effectiveness and possible side effects of anticoagulant therapy  efficacy of lifestyle and medication modifications in managing her hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,77,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year old white Caucasian female presenting with symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Demographics: Age: Elderly patients (>60 years old) are at an increased risk for PE  Sex: Females are slightly more likely to develop PE.  Race: Caucasian race is slightly more affected than other races.  Presenting Symptoms: Acute onset of dyspnea (shortness of breath)  sharp or stabbing chest pain that may be worse with deep breaths  and tachypnea (rapid breathing). The patient might also be experiencing tachycardia (rapid heart rate)  a low grade fever  and coughing up blood.   Past Medical History: 1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): History of previous DVT is one of the most common risk factors. 2. Cancer: Patients with cancer  particularly of the lung  ovary  and pancreas  have a higher incidence of PE. 3. Surgery: Particularly orthopedic surgery (hip or knee replacement) or abdominal surgery in the past three months. 4. Immobility: Extended periods of bed rest or travel (sitting) can lead to blood clot formation. 5. Estrogen therapy: Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. 6. Coagulopathy: Hypercoagulable conditions  including genetic conditions like Factor V Leiden. 7. Cardiac diseases: Atrial fibrillation  congestive heart failure. 8. Pregnancy or recent childbirth. 9. Obesity: Higher BMI can increase the risk of PE. 10. Smoking: Chronic tobacco use can cause damage to the inner lining of vessels.  Additionally  the patient takes warfarin for atrial fibrillation but has had difficulty managing the medication leading to inconsistent international normalized ratio (INR) levels in the past two months.   Review of Systems: Positive for shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  hemoptysis  and syncope. Negative for recent trauma  surgery  or immobilization.  Family history: Positive for thrombophilia in a first-degree relative.   Clinical / Physical Examination: Tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  heart rate 110 beats per minute  oxygen saturation 92% in room air and blood pressure 130/85 mmHg. Physical examination shows clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis  with swelling  tenderness  and redness in the left calf. Crepitus detected on lung auscultation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,78,Patient Profile:  Name: Anna Smith Gender: Female Age: 56 Race: White (Caucasian) Occupation: Accountant Residential Area: Urban  Medical History:  Anna has had no surgical interventions in the past. She has a history of obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. She also has a known medical history of hypertension  which is currently managed with medication. She is suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)  for which she takes oral hypoglycemic medications. Additionally  she has a familial history of coagulation disorders  her mother had venous thromboembolism. There is no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.   Present Illness History:  The patient presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath  thoracic pain  and haemoptysis. The symptoms presented in association with a long period of physical inactivity  especially due to her work-from-home situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Her ambulatory movements have drastically reduced and she has been sitting for extended periods of time.  This profile represents a typical patient suffering from acute pulmonary embolism. The demographic and medical history details mentioned above are in line with the risk factors commonly associated with patients diagnosed with this condition. Factors like age  obesity  physical inactivity  hypertension  diabetes  and familial coagulation disorders are known to enhance the risk of developing thromboembolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,79,Patient Profile:   1. Demographics: - Gender: Female - Age: 50 years old - Race: Caucasian  - Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic - Place of residence: Urban - Occupation: Office job with limited physical activity - Marital Status: Married - Smoker: No - Alcohol: Occasionally   2. Medical History:  - Known case of hypertension for the past 5 years - Oral contraceptive pill user - History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 3 years ago - Underwent right knee replacement surgery 6 months ago - Family history of cardiovascular disease - Previous history of cancer (Breast Cancer) diagnosed and treated 10 years ago.  3. Presenting Symptoms: - Shortness of breath - Chest pain that worsens with deep breaths - Unexplained anxiety - Dizziness  Based on the patient's age  gender  medical history  and presenting symptoms  the likelihood of the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is high. Evidence suggests that PE is more commonly observed in middle-aged to older adults. The use of oral contraceptives  previous history of DVT  sedentary work and recent surgery places her at a higher risk. Furthermore  cancer survivors are at an increased risk for PE.  The symptoms the patient is experiencing - chest pain  shortness of breath  anxiety and dizziness - are common in PE  although PE can also be asymptomatic. It is crucial to proceed with prompt and appropriate diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis and initiate suitable treatment.  Note: Acute pulmonary embolism is a medical emergency and this problem representation might not be universally applicable  due to variations in individual health status and demographics.

Obesity 8. Family history of thrombotic conditions  Demographic and empirical considerations: The patient's main symptomology and intermediate risk predilection  combined with her meeting several of the classical risk factors (recent surgery  age  obesity  hereditary predisposition) for the development of a pulmonary embolism  necessitates a diagnostic workup focused on the rule-out of a potential PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,87,Problem Representation:  Patient: Mr. Brown  Brief Description: A 67-year-old African-American male patient presenting with acute pulmonary embolism.  Demographics:  - Age: 67 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African-American - Education: Bachelor's degree - Occupation: Retired - Marital Status: Married - Living Situation: Lives with wife in a suburban home - Insurance: Medicare  Clinical History:  - Known case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  diagnosed 5 years prior - Smoker for over 30 years (20 cigarettes per day)  stopped 2 years ago - Known case of Hypertension for past 10 years (on medication) - Known case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) for past 7 years (on Metformin) - Has a known family history of hypercoagulable disorders - No known allergies - Previous Medical Operations: Undergone hernia repair surgery 8 years ago - Regular Medications: Metformin for T2DM  Losartan for hypertension - Vaccinations: Up to date for age group  including annual flu and COVID-19 vaccines - Consumption of Alcohol: Occasional  one glass of wine with dinner - Drug use: None  Problem Statement:  This is a case of acute pulmonary embolism. Given the patient's history of DVT and other risk factors such as a history of smoking  hypertension  T2DM along with his demographic profile  the condition is alarming. It's crucial to manage the situation effectively to prevent further complications such as heart failure or sudden death.  This representation is based on statistical data that celebrates African-Americans and males among higher-risk groups for pulmonary embolism. The age group of 60-79 years faces a higher risk  and medical conditions like DVT  hypertension  and diabetes are recognized as risk factors. History of surgery  smoking habits  and family history are also considered significant in such cases. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may increase the chances of developing DVT leading to a pulmonary embolism. However  this patient does not have any history of such treatment. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,88,Patient Profile:  Patient's Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian Occupational History: Retired factory worker Lifestyle: Sedentary  Smoker (30 pack-years) Residential History: Lives alone Family History: Father had a stroke at age 68 Weight: 200 lbs (90 kg) Height: 5'10'' (177.8 cm) BMI: 28.7 (Classified as overweight)  Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension - Diagnosed 10 years ago  currently on medication (Lisinopril). 2. Hyperlipidemia - Diagnosed 8 years ago  currently on statin therapy (Atorvastatin). 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 3 years ago  currently on Metformin. HbA1c within past 6 months = 7.8%. 4. Periodic DVT - The patient has had two episodes of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) within the last five years  managed with anticoagulation therapy.  5. Colon Cancer - Diagnosed and treated 2 years ago  now in remission.   Current Presentation:   John Doe was presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of sharp  pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. He also reported mild hemoptysis. He mentioned that these symptoms began while he was at home  resting. On physical examination  he appeared anxious and was sweating. Oxygen saturation was low (88%  normal range = 95-100%). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (110 bpm  normal range = 60-100 bpm) and mild hypotension (110/70 mmHg  normal range = 120/80 mmHg). Based on these symptoms  medical history  and the physical examination  an initial diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is made  though this would need to be confirmed through further diagnostic investigations such as a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA). John's past history of DVT and recent sedentary lifestyle put him at a higher risk for pulmonary embolism. Other risk factors include his age  smoking habit  and potential hypercoagulable state due to cancer treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,89,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographic: A married Latina woman  aged 60 years participating in religious practices with lower income socioeconomic status  who is currently working as a receptionist. - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle with prolonged sitting hours at work. She is obese with a BMI of 35 and has a 30 pack-year history of smoking. - Family History: Mother and brother had diagnosed cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). - Localization: Lives in a high-altitude city. - Past Medical History: Previous diagnosis of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Had a total knee replacement surgery 3 months ago followed by a long course of bed rest. - Medication: Regularly taking antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication.  Current Presentation: - Symptoms: Shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and cough with slight hemoptysis. - Lab Results: Elevated D-Dimer levels  abnormal ECG results indicating right heart strain.  In this representation  the major demographic risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) are indicated  such as female gender  old age  low socioeconomic status  obesity  and hereditary (family history) predisposition. Additionally  long hours of immobilization at work following a recent history of a joint replacement surgery  which also causes the patient to be bedridden for a long time  alongside her non-compliant lifestyle factors like smoking and obesity  make her a likely person for venous thromboembolism. Simultaneously  relevant personal medical history (hypertension and diabetes) can contribute to the susceptibility of such occurrences.  The given symptoms of the patient align with typical presentations of PE  and the highlighted lab results strongly suggest an acute pulmonary embolism condition. The medication history and possible interactions should also be investigated as potential contributing factors.  **This is a hypothetical patient profile and doesn't refer to any real individual cases. Please consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis or treatment.**

Current Presentation:  The patient has notable risk factors for PE including a history of DVT  long plane flight  HRT  obesity  hypertension and hereditary predisposition. The presence of acute symptoms further increase the possibility of PE.  Relevant Lab Investigations: Diagnostic workup would include labs such as D-dimer  arterial blood gases  complete blood count  coagulation parameters  and imaging like chest X-ray  CT pulmonary angiography (if not contraindicated) or VQ scan.   Treatment: Management should be geared towards stabilization  confirmation of PE  and implementing appropriate anticoagulation therapy promptly.   This problem representation highlights the distinctive features required to formulate an accurate patient profile suitable for a pulmonary embolism simulation scenario or clinical case study.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,91,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: 64-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  living in a semi-urban area.  Social History: Non-smoker  light alcohol intake  currently not engaged in any regular exercise due to physical discomfort and fear of pain exacerbation. Lives with her husband  has three adult children  and seven grandchildren.  Relevant Past Medical History: Patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  diagnosed about 6 months ago. She also has well managed hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Two years ago  she underwent hip replacement surgery on her right leg. Family history includes cardiovascular disease in her father (deceased from myocardial infarction at age 72) and hypertension in her mother (alive  age 86).  Current Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea  mild chest pain  and dry cough. She also reports feeling light-headed and fatigued  and says she has been feeling generally 'unwell' over the past few days. She denies experiencing any fever  sore throat  or recent trauma.  Physical examination reveals a regular pulse rate of 105 bpm  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing ambient air. Chest examination was clear  but there was mild pain on deep inspiration (pleuritic chest pain).  Investigations: An immediate ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia without any signs suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Her D-dimer test was elevated.   Plan: A CT pulmonary angiogram is needed to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. If confirmed  the patient will need immediate anticoagulation therapy and potentially thrombolysis based on hemodynamic stability.  [Note: The representation is based on the typical presentation of an elderly patient with acute pulmonary embolism. The demographics and past medical history are driven by literature and common clinical presentations.]
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,92,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Lopez is a 67-year-old Hispanic male  retired office worker  living in an urban environment and leading a sedentary lifestyle.  Chief Complaint:  He came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest discomfort  coughing up blood  and feeling light-headed.  Past Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both under control with medication. He is a former smoker with a 15 pack year history and quit approximately 12 years ago. Mr. Lopez had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a road traffic accident that resulted in leg fracture 5 years ago. He was treated successfully and had been on DVT prophylaxis for six months after the incident. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: He also discloses a family history of pulmonary embolism in his older brother and a cousin  suggesting possible hereditary factor for thromboembolic disease.  Social History: Mr. Lopez is married with three grown-up children. He lives with his wife and usually does small household chores. His diet is often high in fats and carbohydrates. He once used to be a regular alcohol consumer but now only indulges in moderate drinking during social events.  Personal History: Has a BMI of 31 indicating obesity  which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. He denies taking any recreational drugs.  This information represents a typical American patient who's presented with pulmonary embolism. Studies indicate that pulmonary embolism is common among individuals aged 60-70 years  and male species are more affected than females. Furthermore  conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and history of deep vein thrombosis increase the risk of developing pulmonary embolism. Obesity and sedentary lifestyle have also been identified as common risk factors. This profile aligns well with the reported demographic trends found in the scientific literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,93,Patient Representation:  Demographics: - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Office worker - Lifestyle: Sedentary  non-smoker  non-alcoholic  no exercise routine - BMI: Overweight  i.e.  BMI=28  Past Medical History: - Recent knee replacement surgery: This patient underwent a knee replacement surgery 10 days ago. - Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension under control with oral antihypertensive medication. - Diabetes mellitus: Patient has Type 2 diabetes  managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. - Family history: Her mother passed away due to a pulmonary embolism at age 82.  Current Presentation: She presents with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. This started around three hours ago. She also reports a feeling of apprehension  lightheadedness  and has a noticeable fast heart rate.  Examination Findings: - Vital signs: tachypnea (respiratory rate =25/min)  tachycardia (pulse rate =110/min)  BP=150/90mmHg  SpO2=90% air room. - Chest: Breath sounds are normal on auscultation.  This representation is based on the patient's individual characteristics  which are typical for patients with pulmonary embolism. According to literature  factors such as surgery  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history increase the patient's risk of developing blood clots. Women  especially aged between 60 to 70  are at higher risk  and being overweight increases this likelihood. Conditions like hypertension and diabetes further add to the complication.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,94,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 56 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Sedentary office work Lifestyle: Smoker with an occasional alcohol intake Weight: 200 lbs Height: 6 ft  BMI: 27.1 (Overweight)  Past Medical History:  1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT about three years ago which was well managed. This makes him at risk of recurrence and may act as a risk factor for Pulmonary Embolism (PE).  2. Hypertension: The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the last 10 years.  3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels  increasing his risk for cardiovascular problems including PE.  4. Diabetes type 2: Diagnosed 8 years ago  but under control with medication.  5. Family History: Father suffered from DVT and stroke  which indicates a possible genetic predisposition to clotting disorders.  Presenting complaint:  The patient has complained of sudden onset of difficulty in breathing  chest pain which grew worse on deep breathing  cough with a small amount of bloody sputum  and mild fever.   Assumptions (based on presentation):  Based on the presenting symptoms and past medical history  the concern lies in the possibility of an acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic investigation is required to confirm. This might include imaging tests  such as a CT scan  or blood tests.  Note: This hypothetical profile is based on a typical older  Caucasian male who is overweight and has past cardiovascular conditions. Literature shows that these are typical risk factors for PE. However  PE can present across all ages  ethnicities  and sexes but it shows a slight bias towards older age groups. It is also more likely in individuals who are obese or have a sedentary lifestyle. Smoking  a history of DVT  hypertension and hyperlipidemia are known risk factors. Medical professionals should avoid stereotype bias when faced with potential patients for PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,95,Problem Representation:  Demographics: Patient X is a 59-year-old Caucasian woman residing in an urban area. She is a non-smoker and her BMI is reported to be at the higher end of the overweight range (BMI 29). According to the literature  the prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) increases with age and BMI  and women may present with it more often than men. Caucasian individuals are reported to have the highest prevalence of PE among racial and ethnic groups.  Past Medical History: The patient has a rich past medical history significant for three notable risk factors of PE: recent knee replacement surgery  a past diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  and oral contraceptive use. Her knee replacement surgery was conducted six weeks ago  and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. She has a history of DVT diagnosed five years ago  adequately managed with anticoagulation therapy at the time. The patient is currently using oral contraceptives for menopausal hormone therapy. Moreover  there is a family history of thrombotic disorders  especially among female kin.  The patient's co-morbidity includes controlled primary hypertension  diagnosed in her late 40s. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus a year ago. Furthermore  she also has a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Her medication regimen includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  metformin  and bisoprolol.   The patient has no known drug allergies but reports having a documented allergy to shellfish.   In conclusion  the given patient is at high risk for acute PE due to the various risk factors present: post-surgery status  past DVT history  oral contraceptive use  presence of co-morbidities like hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus and HFpEF  high BMI  and a significant family history of thrombotic disorders. This necessitates vigilant monitoring and management.   Please note that the representation is for illustrative purposes and the actual prevalence and risk factors can vary among different studies and populations. Diagnosis should be based on clinical and diagnostic tests rather than purely demographic and past medical history.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,96,Patient Profile: - Name: Patricia Simpson - Gender: Female - Age: 64 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Medical History: - Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Former smoker (25 pack-years history; quit 15 years ago) - Previous deep vein thrombosis following total knee replacement surgery 4 years ago - Positive family history of venous thromboembolic disease (mother with diagnosed pulmonary embolism)  Current Clinical Presentation: Patricia came to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  worsening over the last few hours  associated with sharp  pleuritic chest pain. She has also noted some mild leg swelling over the last few days which is unusual for her.  Socio-economic Background: Retired high school teacher  lives with her husband of 40 years in a suburb. Two grown children live out of state. She manages her own medications  drives  and handles all activities of daily living independently.  Health Behavior: She follows a Mediterranean diet and walks her dog for 30 minutes each day. She reports being medication compliant and has regular check-ups with her primary care physician.  Relevance: The patient's age  female gender  Caucasian ethnicity  and prior deep vein thrombosis following surgery indicates higher risk for Pulmonary Embolism. The patient's shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and leg swelling indicate current clinical signs of Pulmonary Embolism. The presence of chronic conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia contributes to the overall cardiovascular risk profile. Her family history of venous thromboembolic disease further elevates her genetic predisposition to such events.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,6,97,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Female (Since according to literature  pulmonary embolism (PE) shows slight predilection towards females.) - Age: 65 years (Risk of PE increases with age  peaking in the elderly.) - Race: Non-Hispanic White (Highest incidence found in this group)  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or coughing  and feeling lightheaded or faint. Possible presence of cough and hemoptysis.  Past Medical History:  - Recent major surgery: The patient underwent a knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. - Comorbidity: The patient has a history of high blood pressure  obesity (BMI > 30)  and type 2 diabetes. - Lifestyle: The patient is a former smoker and has a history of long-term oral contraceptive usage. - No known allergies.  Family History: The patient's mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis and her sister has had a previous PE.  On Examination: The patient appears acutely ill and anxious  with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 100 beats per minute  and O2 saturation of 91% on room air.   Working Diagnosis: Given the typical symptoms and the patient's age  presentation  and risk factors such as recent major surgery and heredity  acute pulmonary embolism is highly suspected.  Investigation Plan: The physician decides to order D-dimer testing  a CT pulmonary angiogram  and possibly a lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound to further confirm the diagnosis. They also order blood work to assess for cardiac damage or other complications.  Plan for Management: If the diagnosis is confirmed  the patient will be immediately started on anticoagulation therapy  aiming to prevent further clot development and to prevent post-PE syndrome. If PE is confirmed and severity is high with hypotension or shock  thrombolytic therapy may also be considered.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,1,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Woman with Obesity: A Case Report   Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must always be considered in patients with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  or a relevant medical history.  Case Description:  A 63-year-old African-American female presented at the emergency department with a 2-day history of acute-onset dyspnea  chest discomfort  and productive cough with white sputum. The patient had no known history of similar symptoms and had not been exposed to anyone with respiratory symptoms.  Demographic Information: The patient is a postmenopausal woman with a past medical history of obesity (BMI of 32)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is a lifelong non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer. She does not have a history of surgical procedures. She is retired and lives with her husband.   Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 50 and with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the age of 56. Both conditions have been managed satisfactorily over the years with metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension. She has been experiencing obesity for the last ten years. She had a menopause at the age of 52 and was not on any hormones replacement therapy.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient was breathless at rest  with a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 150/90mmHg  temperature of 37.8°C  respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. She had decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe and her chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion.  Diagnosis: Given the sudden onset of symptoms  her demographic  and significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism  a high suspicion of acute PE was developed. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which showed a large central filling defect in the left pulmonary artery and its branches matching a massive PE.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was immediately started on Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)  supplemental oxygen  and intravenous fluids. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close observation and further management. Over the next few days  her symptoms improved substantially and her vital signs stabilized. She was later transitioned to oral anticoagulation with Warfarin  and subsequently discharged to home with a referral for obesity management and prevention of future PE.  Conclusion: This case exemplifies the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients with sudden onset dyspnea  especially those with risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  and diabetes. Timely diagnosis and management is crucial to prevent severe morbidity and mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,2,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female with a Past History of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction: This report discusses a case involving a 55-year-old Hispanic female who presented to the emergency department with acute symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism. The patient’s past medical history revealed a previous episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a known risk factor for the development of pulmonary embolism.   Case Presentation: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic female  a resident of southern Texas  USA. She is a housewife who had never smoked and leads a sedentary lifestyle. Her past medical history includes a single episode of deep vein thrombosis five years ago  managed with anticoagulants  and controlled Type II Diabetes. Overweight with a BMI of 28.3  she has a family history of cardiovascular disease and thromboembolic disorders.  She arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe  sharp chest pain mostly on the right side that intensified with deep inspirations  and dyspnea. The patient also described episodes of fainting and excessive sweating. She denied any recent surgery  prolonged immobilization  contraceptive use  or history of high-risk pregnancy/miscarriage.  Physical examination demonstrated tachycardia (heart rate 115 beats/minute)  tachypnea (respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute)  blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Examination of the lungs indicated decreased breath sounds on the right side. Swelling  pain  and warmth of the left lower extremity were also noted.  Investigations: Post physical examination  the suspicion of pulmonary embolism was high. A D-Dimer test was ordered and showed an elevated value of 800 ng/mL (reference: < 500 ng/mL). The patient was subjected to urgent Computerised Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) which confirmed the presence of emboli in the right pulmonary artery. Lower limb venous Doppler ultrasound demonstrated thrombosis in the left popliteal vein  indicating a likely source for the emboli.  Management and Outcomes: The patient received immediate treatment with systemic intravenous anticoagulation. Given the acute nature and severity of the condition  thrombolytic therapy was initiated. Within 72 hours of management  there was a significant improvement in her breathing  and a repeat CTPA confirmed reduction in the size of the emboli. She was discharged on extended anticoagulation therapy and was advised weight reduction  increased physical activity  and strict blood glucose control.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of a thorough past medical history and the need for strong clinical suspicion in diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. Patients with past episodes of DVT  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and family history of thromboembolic disorders should be followed up regularly to catch recurrent episodes early. This case also underscores the importance of adherence to extended anticoagulation regimens in patients with recurrent thromboembolic events.   Conclusion: This patient’s history and presentation emphasize the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in high-risk patients presenting with acute unexplaned dyspnea and chest pain. This report also highlights the critical role of anticoagulation therapy in managing such conditions.

Presenting Complaints: The patient reported shortness of breath  chest pain that increased with deep breathing  and a rapidly advancing general feeling of unwellness. She rated her chest pain as 7 on a scale of 10 which exerted towards her left shoulder.  Medical History: The patient's medical history revealed hypertension  borderline diabetes  and varicose veins for which she was on medication. She was also post-menopausal and was not on hormone replacement therapy. She had no known drug allergies and no history of smoking or alcoholism. Her surgical history was significant for a laparoscopic appendectomy approximately 20 years ago. Her family history was unremarkable  with no listed hematological disorders.  Examinations and Investigations: Physical examination indicated a-accentuated second heart sound  and her oxygen saturation on room air was 91%. The patient looked anxious and had a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  a heart rate of 112 beats per minute  and a blood pressure of 149/97 mmHg. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed a right bundle branch block and her chest X-ray was normal. A Computer Tomographic Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and sub-segmental arteries of all the lung lobes indicative of acute emboli.   The D-dimer level was high at 795 ng/mL FEU (cut-off <500 ng/mL FEU). Other laboratory findings included WBC count 12K/uL Neutrophils 80%  Hb 14 g/dl  Platelets 400K/uL  PT 12.4 sec  APTT 30 sec  INR 1.0 Glucose  fasting 98 mg/dl  Total cholesterol 235 mg/dl  LDL 155 mg/dl  HDL 45 mg/dl  Sodium 137 mmol/L  Potassium 3.8 mmol/L  and Creatinine 0.9 mg/dl.   Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism based on clinical symptoms  high D-dimer levels  and CTPA results.  Treatment and Follow-Up: She was immediately administered low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and supportive oxygen therapy was initiated. After hemodynamic stabilization  the oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban was initiated. The patient's symptoms progressively decreased and she was discharged with strict advice to follow up.   This case provided insights into the risk factors of acute pulmonary embolism and highlighted the importance of considering this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  and signs of deep vein thrombosis. Elderly patients with hypertension  varicose veins  or other related conditions should be carefully monitored for PE. Early diagnosis and management can significantly improve prognosis and reduce mortality.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,4,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 55-year-old Hispanic Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction: Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that is often seen in the hospital settings. We present the case of a 55-year-old Hispanic female patient  presenting with acute shortness of breath  found to have acute pulmonary embolism with her underlying history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 55-year-old Hispanic female living in San Antonio  Texas  presented to the emergency room complaining of sudden onset chest pain and difficulty in breathing.  Clinical Findings: The patient looked distressed and was hemodynamically stable but was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm  and O2 saturation was 92% on room air. Blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the lower right side of the chest. Lower limb examination indicated mild edema and tenderness in the left calf muscle.  Diagnostic Assessment: A D-dimer test was positive. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a pulmonary embolism in the lower lobe of the right lung. An ultrasound Doppler study of the lower limbs revealed thrombosis in the left posterior tibial vein  suggestive of DVT.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started immediately on oxygen therapy and therapeutic–dose anticoagulant (enoxaparin) in the emergency room.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Over the next 48 hours in the intensive care unit  the patient's shortness of breath improved significantly  and vitals were stabilized. She was discharged on oral anticoagulation (rivaroxaban) therapy with proper instructions regarding the risk of bleeding. She was also advised to return for follow-up appointments and anticoagulant monitoring.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed that she was unaware that her DVT could lead to such a serious condition. She confirmed that she would adhere to her medication schedule and follow-up appointments to prevent future complications.  Conclusion: The risk of pulmonary embolism in patients with a history of DVT is substantial. Hence careful follow-up and proper adherence to anticoagulation therapy are vital in preventing life-threatening acute pulmonary embolism. This case underlines the importance of early detection  prompt treatment  and patient education in managing DVT and its complications.  Clinical Lessons: This case serves as a reminder that patients with a history of DVT are at high risk of developing acute pulmonary embolism and should be managed accordingly to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. A multi-disciplinary approach  including early involvement of a hematologist for consultation and collaboration with patient's primary healthcare team  will ensure favourable patient outcomes.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,5,"Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Female with No Significant Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Case Report  Case Presentation:  Demographics: A 64-year-old Caucasian woman Weight: 135 lbs (61.24 kg) Height: 5'4"""" (163 cm) Marital Status: Widowed Employment Status: Retired Teacher Smoking Status: No Alcohol Consumption: Rarely  socially  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. She had been experiencing these symptoms for approximately 48 hours prior to arrival. There was also a noted increase in heart rate (tachycardia) and low-grade fever.  Past Medical History:  The patient’s past medical history was significant for menopause at age 51  and she was not on hormone replacement therapy. She had never been diagnosed with diabetes  hypertension  or any other significant systemic disease. There is no family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The patient has a history of sedentary lifestyle since she retired two years ago.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed the patient was in apparent distress due to dyspnea. She had a temperature of 100.4°F  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient had clear lung sounds with decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Her cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with no murmur  rub  or gallop. The rest of her examination was normal.  Investigations:  Complete blood count (CBC)  electrolytes  and coagulation studies were conducted. The D-dimer level was also significantly elevated. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. A chest computed tomography (CT) angiogram was performed after a suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and showed a filling defect in her right lower lobe pulmonary artery compatible with an acute PE.  Differential Diagnosis:  Acute myocardial infarction  pneumonia  pleuritis were considered as differential diagnoses but were ruled out based on clinical presentation and investigation.  Treatment:  The patient was admitted and initiated on intravenous heparin infusion as per PE protocol. After clinical stabilization  she was transitioned to an oral anticoagulant for long-term management.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient responded well to anticoagulation treatment and her symptoms improved over the duration of her hospital stay. She was discharged with clear instructions on the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications  and she was informed about the signs of recurrent PE. She was due for a follow-up consultation with a hematologist to review potential hypercoagulant states not initially screened for during her hospital stay.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of unexplained dyspnea  even in patients with no significant traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally  this prompted further discussion about the role of a sedentary lifestyle as a potential risk factor for venous thromboembolism."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,6,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a White Middle-Aged Female with Hypertension  Patient Information: Patient L is a white female  aged 52 years  with a history of hypertension. She was born and resides in the United States  is employed as an office worker  and has a family history of deep vein thrombosis. She is a former smoker  quitting approximately five years ago  and leads a moderately sedentary lifestyle.  Clinical Findings: Patient L presented to the emergency department (ED) experiencing sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. She also reported a feeling of unexplained anxiety and persistent cough with occasional streaks of blood-tinged sputum. Physical examination revealed tachypnea  hypotension  and tachycardia.  Diagnostic Assessment: Lab results showed elevated D-dimer levels. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray was clear of any pneumonic process or pneumothorax. Given her symptoms and these results  the suspicion for pulmonary embolism was high. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism  which had caused a small degree of right ventricular strain.  Therapeutic Intervention: Anticoagulation therapy was started immediately with an intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin. The plan was to transition her to oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban  with six months of therapy to prevent further thrombosis and subsequent recurrent pulmonary embolism.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was admitted to ICU for close monitoring due to the degree of right ventricular strain. She responded well to initial anticoagulation therapy  with symptom improvement over the following few days. She was transitioned to rivaroxaban and safely discharged home on the 6th day of hospitalization with instructions for follow-up.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,7,Title: An Unusual Case of Acute Pulley Pulmonary Embolism in a 56-Year-Old Caucasian Male with Esophageal Cancer: A Case Report  Abstract: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common yet sometimes deadly disease with complex diagnosis. Here we report an unusual presentation of acute PE in a patient with a background of esophageal cancer and recent chemotherapy.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 56-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with an episode of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and syncope. The patient is a lawyer living in Washington D.C. and a known case of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus  diagnosed 6 months prior. He had completed his third chemotherapy cycle four weeks before presentation. The patient denies any past history of pulmonary embolism  deep vein thrombosis  or any bleeding disorder. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. His mother died of a stroke  but otherwise  there is no significant familial history of thromboembolic disease.  On examination  the patient's vitals were stable. His oxygen saturation was 88% on room air  and respiratory and cardiac auscultation were unremarkable. Lower limb examination did not show any signs of deep vein thrombosis.   Diagnostic Test: The patient's D-dimer level was elevated at 0.78 μg/mL. Due to his symptoms and elevated D-dimer  a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered  which revealed the presence of a large thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery extending to the lobar arteries  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management and Outcome: The patient was started immediately on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  with subsequent transition to oral anticoagulant - Rivaroxaban (factor Xa inhibitor). His oxygen saturation improved  and his chest pain and shortness of breath subsided within 72 hours. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue Rivaroxaban for at least six months and to return for follow-up in the hematological and thoracic outpatient clinics.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of risk assessment for venous thromboembolism in patients with malignancies like esophageal adenocarcinoma  particularly after chemotherapy. Close communication and shared guidelines between oncologists and hematologists are crucial in managing these challenging cases. This case also highlights that though pulmonary embolism is a serious condition  it can be managed effectively with prompt recognition and appropriate therapeutic intervention.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,8,Title: Acute Pulley Pulmonary Embolism in a 55-Year-Old Caucasian Female with a History of Obesity and Smoking.  Case Introduction:  A 55-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) with an abrupt onset of shortness of breath and sharp chest pain exacerbated with deep breathing. Being an active smoker and having a BMI of 35  she has a noted past medical history of obesity and hypertension but was generally in good health up until her current symptoms began early in the morning.  Clinical Findings:  Upon her arrival at the ED  her vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 beats/min (tachycardia)  a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg (hypertension)  respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min (tachypnea)  an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air (hypoxia)  and a temperature of 37.8°C. Physical examinations noted decreased breath sounds on the right lower lung field. Her EKG showed nonspecific ST changes  but no clear signs of right heart strain or acute myocardial infarction.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given her risk factors and symptoms  an immediate CT Pulmonary angiogram was requested which confirmed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery  consistent with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Laboratory results displayed an elevated D-Dimer level of 4000 ng/mL (normal range 0-500 ng/mL)  a white blood cell count of 12 000/uL (normal range 4 500-11 000 uL)  and an elevated Troponin level of 0.15 ng/mL (normal range 0.00-0.04 ng/mL).   Therapeutic Intervention:  She was immediately started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation according to hospital protocol for acute pulmonary embolism. In addition  supplemental oxygen was given to correct her hypoxia. After stable for 24 hours  she was transitioned to oral apixaban for long-term anticoagulation therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  After five days of hospitalization  she was discharged with instructions for lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation assistance and weight management guidance. She was to follow up with her primary care physician within a week of discharge and evaluation by a pulmonologist and hematologist within 2 weeks. During follow-up  she showed marked improvement in her symptoms and adherence to her anticoagulation medication.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed gratitude for the timely diagnosis and treatment. She was motivated to make lifestyle changes  especially in regards to her smoking habits and weight control. With proper education about her condition  she understood the importance of medication compliance and follow-up visits.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute onset shortness of breath and chest pain  particularly in those with risk factors such as obesity and active smoking habits. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,9,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 69-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) represents a critical clinical condition with potential severe outcomes if not promptly diagnosed and managed. It comprises a spectrum of medical emergencies featured by the sudden blockage of lung arteries. PE primarily originates from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs or other parts of the body (venous thromboembolism - VTE). This case report further explores the presentation  diagnosis  management  and clinical course of an elderly patient with acute PE.  Case Presentation:   Patient Information:  A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute symptoms of unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  and palpitation. He lived in a suburb in Ohio and was a retired automobile mechanic. His body mass index (BMI) was 29 kg/m2  reporting a history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient was a smoker for 35 years but quit smoking ten years ago. He denied any history of malignancy  recent major surgeries  or prolonged immobilization.  Clinical findings:  On examination  the patient's heart rate was 110 beats per minute and blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg. Oxygen saturation on room air was 90%  which improved to 95% with a 4-liter oxygen supplement. There were no signs of deep vein thrombosis on physical examination.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Owing to an elevated clinical suspicion of acute PE  a D-dimer test was conducted  which turned out to be significantly elevated  coupled with an abnormal Electrocardiogram showing tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered  confirming the diagnosis with the findings of a large clot in the right main pulmonary artery extending to its distal segments.  Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-up: The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy (unfractionated heparin) promptly in the ED. Following confirmation of the diagnosis  oral anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy was initiated with a bridging strategy.  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit  mainly for close observation and complication management. After 48 hours  his symptoms reduced significantly  and hemodynamic stability was gained. He was explained about the importance of long-term anticoagulation. After a week-long hospital stay  he was discharged in stable condition with a referral for outpatient follow-up care.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of high clinical index of suspicion for early detection and immediate treatment of PE in high-risk populations. While our patient achieved a stable clinical recovery  severe PE could lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized  highlighting the vital dimension of acute PE management. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,10,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Demographics: Patient X is a 64-year-old African American female from a rural area  non-smoker  with a past medical history of overweight and hypertension but no previous history of venous thromboembolisms or pulmonary embolisms. She is retired and is also engaged in some light occasional farming activities in her house's backyard.  Presenting Issue: Patient X presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and a feeling of unexplainable dread. These symptoms initiated suddenly while the patient was doing her routine activities. She also reported a recent (one week ago) ankle sprain which rendered her less mobile than usual. There was no associated cough or fever.  Clinical Examination: On admission  the patient was anxious and diaphoretic. Her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 102 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute  an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  and a temperature of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  Investigations: An EKG was promptly performed and showed a sinus tachycardia with no other abnormalities. Her D-dimer was elevated at 600 ng/mL (normal range: less than 500 ng/mL). Chest radiography was normal  and her arterial blood gas (ABG) demonstrated hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 60mmHg. Due to the presence of unexplained hypoxia with elevated D-Dimer levels  an urgent CT angiogram of her chest was arranged  revealing acute pulmonary emboli in both pulmonary arteries and some peripheral branches.  Treatment: Patient X was started on unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusion once pulmonary embolism was confirmed  with a bidirectional goal of preventing further clot extension and reducing the clot burden. After an evaluation of clinical stability and no contraindications  the transition was made to oral anticoagulation therapy. The patient was placed on Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for three weeks  to continue at 20mg once daily for long-term anticoagulation.  Outcome and Follow-up: Following 48 hours of hospitalization  the patient's symptomatology improvement and stabilization constructively withstood her release from the emergency department with continued oral anticoagulation and follow up with outpatient cardiology and primary care. Patient X is being educated about risk factors for the development of thromboembolic disease and the importance of adhering to her medication regimen.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the need for high clinical suspicion for pulmonary emboli in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms like unexplained shortness of breath  particularly in those with recent immobilization  even as benign as an ankle sprain. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,11,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-Year-Old Caucasian Female with History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Case Report:  Introduction: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a severe cardiovascular emergency associated with high mortality rates especially in the elderly population. This case report describes the occurrence of acute PE in a 65-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Patient Information and Clinical Findings:   Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and anxiety. She reported that the symptoms had begun abruptly a few hours earlier. This patient was a non-smoker and had a medical history significant for DVT five years prior for which she was placed on a course of anticoagulation therapy  but this was discontinued after a year. She had no known allergies and her family history included hypertension and heart disease.   On initial assessment  she was visibly distressed and her vital signs revealed tachycardia and hypoxia. There was no peripheral edema or signs of deep vein thrombosis on physical examination.  Blood test results showed elevated D- Dimer levels and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed S1Q3T3 pattern suggesting acute pulmonary embolism.   Diagnostic Assessment:   The patient was immediately subjected to a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) considering her symptoms and past medical history. CTPA revealed multiple filling defects in bilateral pulmonary arteries confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on high-dose anticoagulation therapy. In light of the confirmed diagnosis and her previous history of DVT  the decision to initiate long-term anticoagulation was instantly taken by the clinical team. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring due to the severity of her condition.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:   Over the course of admission  the patient's symptoms began to alleviate. Her vital signs stabilized and repeat blood tests showed a declining trend of D-dimer levels. Post discharge  the patient was closely monitored through regular outpatient visits and there was no recurrent PE or DVT reported during the following 6 months.  Discussion:  Our case represents a classic presentation of acute pulmonary embolism in a middle-aged  Caucasian woman with significant past medical history of DVT. This highlights the importance of considering PE in patients with previous venous thromboembolism presenting with acute respiratory symptoms  and thus warrants immediate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.  Conclusions:  This case underlines the vital recognition and management of PE  particularly in those with past DVT history. It emphasizes that long-term anticoagulation may be necessary in some patients to prevent the occurrence of potentially fatal conditions like pulmonary embolism. The relevant clinical guidelines should guide the management of such patients. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,12,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Operative African American Male  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 55-year-old African American male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with the chief complaint of sudden breathlessness and moderate to severe chest pain. The patient resided in a rural community in Wisconsin and worked as a truck driver. He had no history of smoking or drug abuse. He is married and has three children.  His past medical history was significant for hypertension  coronary artery disease (CAD)  and obesity with a BMI of 33. His surgical history includes a recent total knee arthroplasty performed three weeks ago. Since his operation  he had been mostly home-bound due to limited mobility. Family history revealed his father had died from a stroke at the age of 60 and a paternal uncle had a fatal pulmonary embolism in his early 50s.   On presentation  the patient was sweating  grimacing  and clutching his chest. His vital signs revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm  oxygen saturation of 89% on room air  a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  and blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. The physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe with no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  Due to the recent surgery  immobility  and symptoms  a suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism was raised. Laboratory findings showed elevated D-dimer levels. An urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was requested showing filling defects consistent with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the right lower lung lobe.   He was started on high-flow oxygen and promptly anticoagulated with intravenous heparin. The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to his significant risk factors and was later transitioned to oral anticoagulants. His stay in the hospital was uncomplicated  and he was enrolled in a program for early post-discharge follow-up and physiotherapy to improve his mobility.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the risk factors for pulmonary embolism  such as obesity  post-operative state  and a family history of venous thromboembolism. Despite the lack of risk from smoking and drug use  the patient's demographic characteristics and past medical history  including hypertension and coronary artery disease  added to the complexity of the presentation. Hence  immediate diagnosis and optimal patient management strategies significantly improved the patient outcome in this case. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,13,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 58-year-old African American Female with History of Hypertension  Patient Information: The patient is a 58-year-old African American female who presented to the emergency department complaining of chest pain  shortness of breath  and sudden onset lightheadedness. She is a nonsmoker with a known medical history of hypertension which is controlled with medication.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute (bpm)  and had a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg. She appeared distressed and was taking shallow  rapid breaths. Her oxygen saturation recorded from pulse-oximetry was 86% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no significant ST-T wave changes  and the chest X-ray was inconclusive with no signs of active lung disease. Her D-dimer lab test was highly positive leading to suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. This suspicion was confirmed by a CT Pulmonary Angiogram which showed hallmark signs of large bilateral pulmonary embolisms.  Therapeutic Intervention: Anticoagulation therapy was immediately initiated with an intravenous administration of heparin. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further management. Over the next few days  the patient’s symptoms improved gradually.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient was subsequently discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy  specifically rivaroxaban  to be continued for six months. An evaluation of risk factors revealed no recent long-haul travel  surgery  malignancy  or genetic predisposition. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis was found in lower limb venous doppler studies.  Patient Perspective: The patient reported a massive improvement in breathing and overall health post-treatment. She was educated about the risks and signs of pulmonary embolism  and the importance of adherence to her anticoagulation therapy.  Conclusion: This case highlights the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with uncharacteristic respiratory or cardiac symptoms. Early recognition and timely initiation of anticoagulation therapy can greatly enhance patient outcomes and survival in such cases. Regular follow-ups should be ensured for optimal patient management in such cases. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,14,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a catastrophic clinical condition  with a high incidence of mortality if left undiagnosed and untreated. It's a common cardiovascular disorder  predominantly in the very young or older patient populations. However  it can be a predicament in middle-aged individuals as well.  Case Presentation: A 48-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with the sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain  and hemoptysis. The patient works a sedentary job and leads a largely inactive lifestyle due to the nature of his work. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no known history of diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease. He has smoked half-a-pack of cigarettes daily for the last 25 years and reports occasional alcohol intake. His family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis in his father and a brother who had an ischemic stroke.  On arrival  his vital signs were unstable with noted hypotension  tachycardia  and hypoxia. Physical examination revealed reduced breath sounds on the right side. His initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia  while his chest X-ray was unremarkable.   Given the sudden onset and severity of his symptoms  a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed. The CTPA demonstrated multiple thrombi in both the left and right pulmonary arteries  consistent with acute PE. Laboratory results showed elevated D-dimer levels and troponin T levels  while complete blood count (CBC) showed mild anemia and leukocytosis.   The patient was immediately commenced on heparin infusion and admitted to the intensive care unit.   Discussion: The patient's sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and family history of thromboembolic disease posed a significant risk for the development of PE. His presentation is consistent with acute cor pulmonale  secondary to the obstructing thrombi. Despite the absence of findings in the chest X-ray  a high clinical suspicion and the application of CTPA allowed for accurate diagnosis.   Conclusion: Although PE is more generally associated with the very young or elderly  this case demonstrates that it can occur in middle-aged adults as well. A high clinical suspicion of PE must be maintained in patients with compatible symptoms  especially in those with significant risk factors. This case emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modifications and regular screening in individuals with risk factors for PE.  References: Literature references would be included here.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,15,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  BACKGROUND:   Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially lethal condition. It is the third most frequent cardiovascular syndrome after coronary artery disease and stroke.  CASE SUMMARY:  A 57-year-old Caucasian female presented at the Emergency Unit of our hospital complaining of recent (last five days) onset of dyspnea and chest pain. She was a lifelong nonsmoker  had a sedentary lifestyle  and had been postmenopausal for seven years. Her past medical history was notable for hypertension controlled with amlodipine and diet  as well as Stage II obesity (BMI 35). There was no prior history of thrombotic events  nor family history of venous thromboembolism. She also reported that she had been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for 6 years.  On examination  her vital signs were blood pressure 135/80 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 24 breaths/min  oxygen saturation 90% on room air  and temperature 98.6 °F. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone. The rest of systemic examination was essentially normal. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia and her chest x-ray was inconclusive.  Her blood work revealed an elevated D-dimer level at 2 000 ng/mL (normal <500 ng/mL). The computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed a clot in the right pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed an enlarged right ventricle suggesting an increased cardiac pressure due to the pulmonary embolism.  TREATMENT AND OUTCOME:  She was started on anticoagulants (subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin followed by oral rivaroxaban) promptly and received oxygen supplementation. The patient showed improvement within a week with a resolution of dyspnea and chest pain. The patient’s HRT was discontinued considering it might have predisposed her to the thrombotic event  in conjunction with her other risk factors including obesity and sedentary lifestyle. In the follow-up period of six months  the patient remained asymptomatic and her repeat echocardiography showed normal right ventricular size and function.   CONCLUSION:  This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women on HRT presenting with dyspnea and chest pain. Early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulant therapy is vital to prevent morbidity and mortality. The case also underscores the need for carefully weighing the benefits against risks before initiating HRT in postmenopausal women.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,16,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 55-Year-Old African-American Female Post-Surgical Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) is a potentially lethal condition with high mortality rate if it goes unrecognized and untreated. Its occurrence is reported in various demographics but has been found to be particularly prevalent in African-American individuals. This case report involves a 55-year-old African-American female who developed signs of APE following orthopedic surgery.  Case presentation: A 55-year-old African-American female patient with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension presented at our tertiary healthcare institution with signs and symptoms indicative of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). The patient had undergone orthopedic surgery  total left knee replacement  a week prior to her presentation at our hospital. She complained of increased difficulties in breathing  sharp chest pain  dizziness  and palpitations.  The patient was a non-smoker  moderate drinker  and not on any prophylactic anticoagulant therapy post-surgery. She had a family history of blood clots; her father had a pulmonary embolism at the age of 60. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) was 32.4 kg/m^2  which classified her as obese according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The patient also had a sedentary lifestyle  lacking any substantial physical exercise.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 105 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation at room air was 90%. On auscultation  breath sounds were reduced bilaterally with accentuated second heart sound.   Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of pulmonary embolism. D-dimer level was significantly elevated. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed a large filling defect in the left pulmonary artery  consistent with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.  The patient was started on intravenous heparin. Thrombolytic therapy was initiated due to the patient's hemodynamic instability. Her condition improved over the course of a week  with decreasing dyspnea and better oxygen saturation.  Conclusion: Acute Pulmonary Embolism is a significant health concern  particularly in postoperative patients. This case underlines the importance of assessing risk factors for APE like obesity  family history of thromboembolic events  and high-risk surgeries in the African-American population. It also emphasizes the importance of prophylactic measures  such as anticoagulation postoperatively in high-risk patients and lifestyle modifications  for the prevention of APE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,17,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 52-Year-Old African American Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition primarily caused by deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It is reportedly more prevalent in African American populations compared to Caucasian populations.  Patient Information:  The patient is a 52-year-old African American female  with a weight of 170 lbs and a height of 5.4 feet. She hails from a lower-middle-class socioeconomic background in an urban area. Her employment history includes over 20 years of sedentary work as a receptionist.  She is known to have Hypertension diagnosed at the age of 40  for which she was on regular Amlodipine. She's also a known case of Diabetes Mellitus type 2 diagnosed about five years ago  for which she was on oral Metformin. She quit smoking ten years ago but had a history of 15 pack years.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented with a sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. She noticed the pain during rest without any associated symptoms like cough  fever  or hemoptysis. Upon examination  the patient was found to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 per minute and mildly tachycardic with a heart rate of 102 per minute. Blood pressure was 123/86 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The D-dimer test was ordered considering a high clinical suspicion of PE  which turned out to be positive. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia without any S1Q3T3 pattern. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was then performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE by showing filling defects in bilateral pulmonary arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initiated on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) along with oxygen supplementation. She was admitted to the ICU with regular monitoring of vitals and serial checking of coagulation profile. Hematology consultation was sought and considering long-term anticoagulation  oral apixaban was started after 48 hours of LMWH.  Follow up and Outcomes:  The patient showed remarkable improvement over the next few days with reduction of dyspnea and chest pain and was discharged on the tenth day. She was advised to continue oral apixaban and instructed for routine outpatient follow-ups.  Conclusion:  The purpose of this case report is to underscore the importance of early recognition and therapeutic intervention in acute pulmonary embolism  especially in higher-risk populations like ours. A higher index of suspicion  even with non-specific symptoms  is necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,18,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Obese Male with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:  Acute pulmonary embolism is a distressingly common and potentially fatal disease that is still underdiagnosed. This case report discusses a 50-year-old Spanish male with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis who presented with acute PE.  Patient Information:  The patient  Mr. X  is a 50-year-old Spanish male. He is an accountant by profession and resides in Barcelona. He is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2 and has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed five years prior.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. X presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and an episode of fainting. On admission  his vital signs were unstable: blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg  pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  respiration rate of 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A high-resolution contrast computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out  which showed a filling defect in the main pulmonary artery  suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Blood investigations revealed elevated levels of D-dimer and troponin. An echo-cardiogram confirmed right heart strain. These findings are consistent with an acute massive PE.  The patient's past medical history of DVT and his active sedentary lifestyle predisposed him to this PE. Furthermore  his obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for VTE and likely played a role in its development.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Mr. X was started on anticoagulants promptly as per the standard protocol for acute PE. He was initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring  and thrombolytic therapy was initiated given his unstable hemodynamics.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  With supportive care  therapeutic intervention  and anticoagulant use  Mr. X's symptoms improved over the next few days  and his vital signs stabilized. However  due to the severity of his condition  a decision was made to continue his anticoagulation therapy indefinitely  and he was advised to work on weight reduction and increase mobility.  Patient Perspective:  Mr. X was distressed by the severity of his condition but was relieved with timely diagnosis and management.  Conclusion:  This case reflects the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE in obese patients and those with a history of VTE who present with sudden respiratory distress and chest pain. Early recognition  immediate therapeutic intervention  and modification of risk factors are vital for a positive outcome.   Learning Points:  - Obesity and sedentary lifestyle are significant risk factors for PE. - The existence of past thromboembolic episodes increases the risk of PE. - In unstable patients with verified PE  thrombolytic therapy can be lifesaving.  - The long term prognosis in PE is typically determined by the underlying disorder.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,21,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 68-year-old Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction:  Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a commonly occurring cardiovascular emergency that often results from Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). It is characterized by sudden blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. PE cases are diverse and can occur in different demographic groups. In this case  we present a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a prior history of deep vein thrombosis that experienced acute pulmonary embolism.  Case Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) presented herself to the emergency department complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that worsened upon deep inspiration. Additionally  she reported increased leg swelling  which she had been experiencing for the past two days. Her medical history indicated she was diagnosed with DVT five years ago after undergoing a hip replacement procedure. Consequently  she had been on regular anticoagulation therapy (warfarin) which she admits she discontinued a week prior to her symptoms commencement due to gastrointestinal upset.  Physical Examination and Diagnostics: Her initial vital signs noted a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 per minute and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. On examination  she exhibited cyanosis  tachypnea and her right lower limb was swollen  tender  and warm to touch. No other significant clinical findings were noted. In light of her history and clinical presentation  she was suspected with acute PE.  An urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. A Doppler Ultrasound was subsequently performed  which revealed an acute DVT in the right lower limb. Laboratory findings showed increased levels of D-dimer and a slightly elevated troponin level.  Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately administered intravenous unfractionated heparin and her symptoms began to subside after 48 hours. After stabilization  warfarin therapy was restarted  with the patient counseled on the importance of adherence to medication. The patient was discharged after seven days with resolution of symptoms  and scheduled for regular outpatient follow-ups for routine monitoring of INR levels and clinical condition.  Conclusion:  Acute PE often presents as a medical emergency which requires immediate diagnosis and prompt anticoagulant therapy. History of DVT and non-adherence to anticoagulation therapy form significant risk factors. This case underscores the importance of strict adherence to anticoagulation therapy in high-risk patients and the need for adequate patient education about the significance and potential complications of medication non-adherence.  Peer Review: This case report has been peer-reviewed by a panel of three Independent Medical Professionals specializing in Internal Medicine and Pulmonary diseases. The case presented agrees with similar cases reported in literature and current medical guidelines for diagnosis and management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,22,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 60-Year-Old African American Male  Patient Information:  A 60-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain for the past six hours. The chest pain was observed to be tight  constant  and 7/10 (VAS score)  radiating to the back. The patient also reported an episode of syncope and profuse sweating.   Demographic Information and medical history:  The patient is a retired construction worker who resides within the local area. He is a divorced father of three adult children and lives alone. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively but he has been inconsistent with medication compliance. There is no family history of kidney disease  stroke  or any blood clotting disorder. However  his younger brother died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 50.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and had difficulty in speaking full sentences. His vitals upon admission were BP 152/96 mmHg  heart rate 102 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  temperature 98.6°F / 37°C  and oxygen saturation at 90% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe  and cardiac auscultation found no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lower extremity examination revealed no swelling or signs of deep venous thrombosis.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Due to the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism  a D-dimer was ordered  which returned significantly elevated. The patient subsequently underwent a CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)  which revealed multiple filling defects in the segmental and sub-segmental arteries of the right lower lobe confirming a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was immediately started on oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous unfractionated Heparin infusion was initiated as per hospital protocol.  Follow-Up:  The patient's oxygen saturation improved with oxygen therapy and heparin infusion. Over the next three days  his symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain reduced significantly. The patient was transitioned to an oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban) and strongly counseled on medication adherence. Before discharge  he was scheduled a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist and cardiologist.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering a pulmonary embolism in patients  even in the absence of the classical clinical features. As risk factors such as African American race  advancing age  smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and hyperlipidemia come into play  rigorous investigation should be pursued when these patients present with chest pain and other subtle indicator symptoms.

A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed extensive clot formation in the right pulmonary arteries  consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. After stabilizing vital signs  he was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for anticoagulation. The patient responded well to the therapeutic approach  and his symptoms gradually improved over several days. An Inferior vena cava filter was later placed given the extensive clot burden  to prevent another possible pulmonary embolism.   He was then transitioned to oral rivaroxaban for long-term anticoagulation and was discharged home following a week of hospitalization.   The importance of medication adherence and follow-up visits was heavily emphasized upon discharge. He was educated about the potential risk of recurrent pulmonary emboli and the need for lifestyle modifications including maintaining a healthy diet  exercise  alcohol moderation  and regular monitoring of his blood pressure and sugar levels.  Follow-up and Implications:  The patient has since attended all of his follow-up appointments and continues to do well. This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and management of acute pulmonary embolism. Rapid initiation of anticoagulation is important in stabilizing the patient and preventing potential complications. It also emphasizes the need for patient education and preventive measures to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,32,Title: An Unexpected Discovery of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 53-year-old Hispanic Female with a Remote History of Breast Cancer  Introduction:  Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder. It often goes unrecognized due to its vast range of manifestations. We present a case of a 53-year-old Hispanic female incidentally diagnosed with APE.  Case Report:  The patient  a 53-year-old Hispanic female from Arizona  a non-smoker with a BMI of 26  was admitted to our hospital for syncope and fatigue. She has a remote medical history of breast cancer (8 years ago) treated with mastectomy and chemotherapy  without recurrence. Since completing treatment  she has been taking tamoxifen as recommended by her oncologist. The patient is also hypertensive  managed with a daily dose of 50 mg Losartan.   The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden-onset shortness of breath  dizziness  and syncope. No recent long travel history  surgery  immobility  or oral contraceptive use was reported.   Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg  a pulse rate of 105 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation revealed normal cardiac sounds but diminished breath sounds on the lower right lung field.  Investigation Details:  A complete blood count showed elevated D-dimer levels (2.5 mcg/mL)  and routine chemistry was unremarkable. Echocardiogram revealed signs of right heart strain. Chest x-ray was nondiagnostic.   Given her high clinical probability and elevated D-dimer  further imaging was ordered. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) subsequently confirmed a large  central  clot in the right pulmonary artery consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was immediately initiated on low molecular weight heparin therapy (enoxaparin) and subsequently transitioned to oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban)  with a plan to continue for at least three months. Her dyspnea gradually improved over the course of her hospital stay  and she was discharged 6 days later with instructions for follow-up with her primary care physician and hematologist.   Conclusion:  This case reiterates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms  especially those with pre-existing risk factors like a history of cancer. Ongoing research in such populations can help enhance our understanding of disease patterns  thereby improving patient management and outcomes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,33,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Case Description:  The patient  a 45-year-old African American female  presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest discomfort  and light-headedness that has been ongoing for four hours. She reported no recent travel or surgery. However  she did mention a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) upon further questioning about her medical past. The patient's family history revealed her mother and an aunt both suffered from thromboembolic diseases.  On physical examination  the patient was agitated and appeared distressed. She was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and oxyhemoglobin saturation of 90% on room air. Her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg  heart rate was elevated at 110 bpm  and body temperature recorded was 37.8-degree Celsius. There were no significant findings on abdominal  neurological  or skin examinations. However  the patient's heart sounds were tachycardic without murmurs  rubs  or gallops  and her lungs displayed decreased breath sounds and crackles at the right lung base.  Further diagnostic testing was immediately initiated. Lab results revealed a high D-dimer level  slightly elevated troponins  and a complete blood count within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of acute ischemia. Chest X-ray was unremarkable but a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed a large  central filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery consistent with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  The patient was then started on anticoagulant therapy  initially with intravenous heparin which was transitioned to oral anticoagulant. Her symptoms gradually improved over the next few days and her vitals stabilized. A venous ultrasound confirmed the presence of an old DVT  probably a source of embolus. The patient was educated regarding the need for long-term anticoagulant therapy and lifestyle modifications considering her significant familial predisposition.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,35,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female  residing in an urban area of Knoxville  Tennessee  USA. She is a non-smoker with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28.2  placing her within the overweight category. She is married and works an office job  with little to no regular physical exercise. She has a history of hypertension and a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further  the patient has a four-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) managed by oral anti-diabetic medication.  Clinical Presentation  The patient was rushed to the emergency department (ED) in a local hospital after experiencing sudden onset severe dyspnea  chest pain  and noticeable symptoms of fatigue. The patient also reported a fainting episode just prior to arrival at the hospital. She denied having any calf pain  swelling  or recent immobilization. The patient also reported no cough  haemoptysis  or recent surgical procedures.  Investigation and Diagnosis  An EKG was performed  which showed signs of acute right heart strain. Labs were drawn  and a D-Dimer test showed a significantly elevated result  raising suspicion for a pulmonary embolism (PE). Additionally  other findings showed glucose of 220 mg/dL and hypertension at 155/90 mmHg.  The diagnosis was confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which indicated a large saddle embolus in both pulmonary arteries and segments of the right lower lobe. In view of these findings and the patient’s critical condition  she was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Outcome  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and immediate treatment. She was administered unfractionated heparin (UFH). Considering the type and degree of PE  she underwent a successful emergency surgical embolectomy. Post-surgery  low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was continued for 5 days  followed by oral anticoagulants (Warfarin). This treatment plan was established in consultation with a multidisciplinary team composed of a cardiovascular surgeon  a pulmonologist  an endocrinologist  and the primary healthcare team.   The patient made a satisfactory recovery and was advised to maintain healthier lifestyle habits  particularly regular physical activity and a balanced diet.  Follow-Up  Given the patient’s underlying type 2 DM and hypertension  close follow-up was advised to ensure the optimization of these conditions  thus reducing her overall thrombotic risk. Additionally  prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy was recommended considering the idiopathic nature of her PE. Regular outpatient appointments were advised for monitoring anticoagulation levels and reviewing the management of her diabetes and hypertension.  Conclusion  The clinical presentation and successful treatment of this patient highlight the urgent necessity of recognizing the potentially perilous signs and symptoms of PE. Furthermore  it underscores the need for an efficient  multidisciplinary approach in managing PE  particularly in patients with underlying chronic diseases.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,36,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Woman with Hepatitis C: A Case Report  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially lethal condition that can lead to serious complications if not promptly detected and treated. It is the third most common cardiovascular disease in the United States after heart attack and stroke. We report a case of a postmenopausal female patient who presented with PE in the setting of untreated Hepatitis C.  Case Report:  The patient is a 59-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female with a past medical history of untreated Hepatitis C infection  hypertension  and obesity. She lives in a rural area of the Midwest and is a lifetime non-smoker who leads a sedentary lifestyle. The patient was admitted to the emergency department (ED) experiencing sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain radiating to her back  dizziness  and tachycardia.  Upon presentation  her vital signs were: Blood Pressure 140/90 mmHg  Heart Rate 105 beats/minute  Respiratory Rate 22 breaths/minute  and Oxygen Saturation 92%. On physical examination  she appeared distressed with noted labored breathing. Her lower extremities were cool to touch  even though no visible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was evident.  Laboratory tests showed increased D-dimer levels (1.2 mg/L FEU)  NT-proBNP (1 543 pg/mL)  and troponin I levels (0.12 ng/mL). Liver function tests showed elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT  76 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST  85 U/L)  consistent with her history of Hepatitis C. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) indicated mild anemia (Hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL) but otherwise within normal limits.  Due to a high suspicion of PE  she underwent Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)  which revealed a large clot load in both pulmonary arteries  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. An ultrasound of the lower limbs was also performed to find the source of the clot but yielded negative results for DVT.   She received intravenous anticoagulation therapy with heparin followed by Rivaroxaban on discharge. The patient was also referred for treatment for her Hepatitis C infection.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering acute PE in patients with vague respiratory symptoms  especially those with risk factors such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and untreated Hepatitis C infection.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,38,Title: Acute pulmonary embolism in a postoperative patient: A case report  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition usually associated with deep vein thrombosis. It involves the partial or complete obstruction of the pulmonary arteries  which may lead to severe complications such as right heart failure or sudden death.  Case Presentation: A 62-year-old African American male patient  with a past medical history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  was admitted to our hospital due to severe progressive shortness of breath accompanied by slight chest pain for the past two days. The patient had undergone knee replacement surgery six days prior to the onset of these symptoms.  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious  cyanotic with evident shortness of breath. His vital signs revealed a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute  heart rate 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 145/90 mmHg  and body temperature 98.6 F. He also had a reduced SpO2 level at 88% in room air. Auscultation of the lungs demonstrated decreased breath sounds on the right side.  A D-Dimer test was performed given the patient's clinical picture  revealing levels significantly higher than normal  which prompted further examination. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was done and confirmed the diagnosis of right-sided massive pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy with intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin. Due to the large size and location of the embolus  the decision was made to perform an emergent pulmonary embolectomy. The procedure was successful  and the patient's shortness of breath and chest pain significantly improved post-operation. He was placed on long-term oral anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis and was advised for regular follow-ups.  Discussion: This case illustrates the risk of acute pulmonary embolism in the postoperative period  even in patients with uncomplicated surgery.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,41,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Previously Healthy  Middle-aged Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a medical condition that arises from a sudden blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. The exact prevalence of PE is unknown due to it often being undiagnosed  but autopsy studies suggest an incidence rate of approximately 60-70 cases per 100 000 person-years. Here  we present a unique case of acute pulmonary embolism in a previously healthy adult female.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with no known previous medical history was brought to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath and palpitations. She mentioned her symptoms started suddenly when she was at rest. She has never smoked and doesn't consume alcohol. Her mother died at a young age due to a stroke  but she was unaware of specific details.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she was tachycardic with heart rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone of the chest.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram showed signs of right ventricular strain suggestive of PE. Her d-dimer levels were significantly elevated. Chest radiographs were normal. A subsequent Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of a large pulmonary embolus in her right lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Treatment: She was commenced on therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as per acute management guidelines.  Follow-up & Outcome: Over the next few days  she showed significant improvement with treatment. On further questioning  she revealed that she recently had a long (approximately 12 hours) airplane ride  which might have predisposed her to developing PE. She was discharged on a direct oral anticoagulant  with instructions to follow-up with a haematologist for hereditary thrombophilia screening given her age  absence of risk factors and family history.  Discussion: PE often presents with vague signs and symptoms  hence its diagnosis can be challenging. This case underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of PE  especially in patients presenting with unexplained tachycardia  chest pain  and shortness of breath  regardless of their past medical history. Rolling out PE in such cases can potentially be life-saving.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed great concern upon learning about her condition but was relieved when there was significant improvement in her symptoms following anticoagulation therapy. She appreciated the importance of following up for thrombophilia screening given her young age and family history of premature vascular events.

The patient reports that the symptoms started abruptly about 2 hours ago when he was at work and didn't subside.  Demographics:  The patient was born and brought up in Mexico and immigrated to the United States two decades ago. He works as a construction worker and lives with his family comprising his wife and two children in a suburban setting. The patient is a non-smoker and reports casual alcohol consumption  limited to social gatherings.  Past Medical history:  The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation (AF) for which he has been irregularly taking anticoagulants and beta-blockers due to financial constraints. He was diagnosed with AF 5 years ago on routine checkup following episodes of faintness and heart palpitations. His family history reveals his mother had chronic heart disease. There were no previous known episodes or family history of venous thromboembolism.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared distressed and anxious. Important observations included tachypnea (Respiratory rate - 28/min)  tachycardia (Heart rate -120 bpm)  blood pressure - 154/92 mm Hg  Oxygen saturation - 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower zones of the right lung.   Diagnostic Assessment:  The clinical picture backed up with his medical history of atrial fibrillation raised the suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). An urgent D-dimer test came back positive. A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately initiated on high-flow oxygen therapy. Considering the size of PE and hemodynamic instability  thrombolysis was planned and patient was administered intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Subsequently  he was switched over to anticoagulants for long-term management.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient’s condition improved over the next few hours. His breathlessness reduced  respiratory and heart rates became stable. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and was later transferred to the medical floor. He was subsequently discharged on the 7th day of admission with advice to continue anticoagulants  manage his AF  and regular physician follow-ups.   Learning Points:  This case underscores the significance of regular medication compliance in patients with AF to prevent potentially life-threatening complications like PE. It also reiterates the importance of early recognition and prompt management of acute PE to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,43,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged African American Female  I. Patient Information  Ms. J  a 55-year-old African American female  visited the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain and sudden onset of shortness of breath. She lives in an urban area in Atlanta  Georgia  and works as a school teacher. Her body mass index (BMI) is 29  indicating overweight. She has no history of alcohol or substance use. She is a non-smoker but lived with a smoking spouse for two decades  which exposed her to secondhand smoke.   II. Medical History  Ms. J has a history of Type II diabetes and hypertension. Her hypertension is fairly controlled with medication (lisinopril)  but her diabetes management is inconsistent due to poor compliance with lifestyle modifications and metformin treatment regimen. She reported inconsistent follow-up with her primary care doctor because of her busy schedule. She has no history of surgeries or blood clotting disorders in her family. She has no known allergies.  III. Current Medical Issue  Ms. J presented with acute distress due to chest pain and reported difficulty breathing. On physical examination  she was pale and sweating  with accelerated breath rate at 24 breaths per minute and pulse rate at 110 beats per minute. Her blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  showing acute elevation. She described her chest pain as sharp  present on the left side  and correlated it with deep inspiration. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds with no rales or wheezes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  IV. Diagnostic Assessment  Preliminary test results showed elevated D-dimers  which indicates a high possibility of a thromboembolic process. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern. We observed right ventricular strain pattern in lead V1 to V3  suggestive of right heart strain precipitated by an acute pulmonary process. Computed tomography angiography of the chest confirmed the suspicion of bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Differential diagnosis that was considered based on her symptoms included acute myocardial infarction  pneumonia  and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  but these were ruled out by further laboratory tests  imaging studies  and the patient's history.  V. Treatment and Progress  Ms. J was started on low molecular weight heparin to prevent further clotting  which reduced her symptoms significantly. Discussions about long-term anticoagulation therapy are in progress  with consideration of her inconsistent medical compliance. She has been referred for dietary and diabetic counseling to manage her BMI and glucose control better.   VI. Learning Points  This case underlines the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with unexplained chest pain and dyspnea  even in the absence of a predisposing factor such as a personal or family history of thrombosis. It is crucial in such instances to obtain rapid diagnostic testing and initiate anticoagulation therapy promptly. Moreover  detailed discussions about lifestyle modifications and medication compliance are essential for long-term management  especially in patients with multiple comorbidities.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,45,Title: A Case Report of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Female Patient with Multiple Sclerosis and Hypertension  Patient Information: Ms. AA is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  living in an urban setting in Texas. She lives alone and maintains an active lifestyle despite suffering from multiple sclerosis for the past twenty years and hypertension  comorbid with a BMI of 26.1  within the overweight range. She does not smoke nor drink alcohol and has no family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient presented at the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  persistent cough  and symptoms of lower extremity swelling.   Past Medical History: As aforementioned  Ms. AA has been managing multiple sclerosis  primarily with disease-modifying therapies. She also has a history of hypertension  controlled effectively with atenolol. She had a mild hypertensive crisis two years ago but did not suffer any cardiovascular events. Ms. AA also had a hysterectomy in her forties due to fibroids.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed tachypnea  with a respiratory rate of 24/min and tachycardia with a heart rate of 110/min. Oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Her blood pressure was within normal limits. Pulmonary auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds over the right side of her chest. Ms. AA was alert and cognitively intact during the examination.   Timeline: Ms. AA was immediately admitted to the hospital after preliminary examination. Imaging and laboratory investigations were conducted within the first 24 hours to establish a diagnosis.   Diagnostic Assessment: A D-Dimer test revealed high levels of the protein fragment (800 ng/mL)  suggesting clot formation. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a filling defect in the branches of her right pulmonary artery consistent with a pulmonary embolism. An ultrasound conducted on both lower extremities showed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg  which presumably embolized to her lungs.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was given intravenous heparin and oxygen therapy upon admission. Subsequently  anticoagulant therapy (Rivaroxaban) was initiated  and her peripheral edema was managed with compression stockings.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Ms. AA was closely monitored for the next three days until her symptoms significantly decreased. Oxygen therapy was gradually discontinued and saturation levels were maintained above 95%. The patient's edema also improved. During her one-month follow-up  the patient is stable and the risk of recurrent PE has been mitigated with Rivaroxaban therapy. She was advised to have regular leg movements to prevent DVT and to maintain her blood pressure within the prescribed range.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of an early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary embolism  especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities  and their effective management with anticoagulants and supportive therapies. Regular follow-ups are crucial to ensure the prevention of recurrence.  
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,46,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cardiovascular incident that can pose life-threatening situations. PE is caused predominantly by a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that dislodges and subsequently blocks one or more pulmonary arteries.  Patient Information:  We report the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian female  a school teacher by occupation  who presented to our emergency room with symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Clinical findings:  The patient initially complained of acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and a brief episode of syncope. On examination  her heart rate was noted to be 110 beats per minute  her blood pressure was 128/76 mmHg  respiratory rate was elevated at 22 breaths/min  and her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Her past medical history was notable for a confirmed DVT incident six years prior. She was not taking any long-term anticoagulant medication but was prescribed a single daily dose of aspirin. She had a history of smoking but quit fifteen years ago. She also reported a sedentary lifestyle due to her profession.  Diagnostic Findings:  Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with signs of right ventricular strain. A D-Dimer test was significantly elevated. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with evidence of a sizable thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic Intervention:  She was immediately established on therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin. Following stabilization of her condition  the patient was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy  choosing Apixaban.   Follow-up and Outcome:  Patient was advised to adhere strictly to her anticoagulation regimen and was regularly monitored for therapeutic efficacy and to minimize bleeding risk. A gradual return of pulmonary function was reported over time with complete resolution of her initial symptoms.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of clinical suspicion for PE in patients with a history of DVT presenting with sudden onset respiratory symptoms. Prompt diagnostic evaluation and immediate anticoagulant therapy could prevent severe morbidity and potential mortality in such individuals.

Presenting Complaint: The patient was rushed to the emergency department following a sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain on the left side that started while he was sitting at his desk working. He reported that he had experienced a dull aching pain and swellings in his left calf for the past two weeks but did not seek medical attention thinking it was due to physical exertion.  Clinical Examination: On presentation  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His heart rate was slightly high (102 bpm)  blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 24 bpm  SpO2 was 91% on room air  which improved to 96% on 2L of oxygen via a nasal cannula. On examination  his left calf was swollen and tender on deep palpitation.   Investigation Results: The elevated d-dimers level of 800 ng/mL (normal range <250 ng/mL) and his symptoms prompted the physicians to order a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) which showed filling defects in the bilateral pulmonary arteries  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. A Doppler ultrasound of his lower limbs confirmed the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was started on therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and admitted to the coronary care unit for monitoring. Anticoagulation was later switched to Warfarin with the guidance of the hospital's anticoagulation service.  Take home points: This case points to the importance of early recognition and prompt management of acute pulmonary embolism. It also emphasizes the need for preventive measures  lifestyle modifications  and improved awareness amongst patients regarding possible symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism  especially in those with risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  sedentary lifestyle  and a history of smoking.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,49,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Woman with Pre-existing Cardiovascular Decompensation  Introduction:  This case report involves a 62-year-old African-American female presenting with acute pulmonary embolism  a potentially life-threatening circulatory disorder  against a background of existing cardiovascular insufficiency.  Patient Information and Clinical Findings: The patient  Mrs. E.A  a retired school teacher from Cincinnati  was brought into the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and fainting spells. She has a significant 15-year history of mild systolic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy  with NYHA class II symptoms. She has been on Carvedilol  Furosemide  and Ramipril. She also has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin  and a history of deep vein thrombosis after a hip replacement surgery 5 years prior. Despite her age  she was physically active and independent  managing her own household after her husband's death.  Upon examination  she appeared pale  anxious  and in respiratory distress. Her temperature was normal at 37.0°C  but she had a rapid pulse rate at 115 beats per minute  elevated blood pressure at 160/90 mmHg  and her oxygen saturation was 88% on ambient air.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood work showed a raised D-dimer level  which was suggestive of a possible clotting disorder. Her serum cardiac enzyme levels were modestly elevated. An Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed tachycardia with right bundle branch block (RBBB)  suggestive of right ventricular strain. A subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed the presence of a large embolus occluding the right main pulmonary artery extending into the segmental branches. Doppler ultrasound of the lower limb veins revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal vein.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with intravenous Unfractionated Heparin. As she was hemodynamically stable  further therapeutic measures such as thrombolysis or surgical thrombectomy were deemed unnecessary. After her immediate condition was stabilized  a long-term plan for anticoagulation was discussed. The patient was switched to Rivaroxaban  a direct oral anticoagulant for her ongoing management.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was monitored closely in the hospital for the next seven days. Her symptoms gradually improved  and she was successfully transitioned to oral anticoagulation with outpatients follow-ups. She was educated about the increased propensity to develop venous clots due to her past medical history and advised lifestyle modifications.  Patient Perspective: Mrs. EA was significantly troubled by her sudden health decline. However  she felt reassured by the therapeutic intervention and was glad to be successfully transitioned to oral anticoagulation therapy.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism  especially in individuals with a past history of DVT and cardiovascular decompensation. Tailored management strategies that take into account the patient's individual risk factors and lifestyle needs are integral to the successful treatment of this disease. Further studies should explore optimal strategies for preventing recurrences in similar high-risk patient groups.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,50,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Asian Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient: 52-year-old Asian female  Presenting Complaints: Shortness of breath  chest pain and palpitations  History: The patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago and was under regular medication (warfarin). She was otherwise healthy and did not consume tobacco or alcohol.  Clinical Examination: Upon examination  the patient looked anxious  and was acutely dyspneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min  heart rate of 122 beats/min  blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Heart sounds were normal  with no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Lungs revealed no crackles or wheezes.   Diagnostic Assessment: The patient underwent a D-dimer test which came back positive. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern  suggesting the possibility of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was confirmed by a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) which showed a filling defect in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initiated on intravenous heparin with a view towards maintaining an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2 times the normal. She was also initiated on supplemental oxygen therapy due to her low oxygen saturation.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was monitored in the intermediate care unit. After 5 days of treatment  the patient's vital signs stabilized  and she reported a significant improvement in her symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain. The warfarin therapy was restarted  and heparin was discontinued after ensuring an adequate overlap. Once the international normalized ratio (INR) was therapeutic for at least 24 hours  the patient was discharged with instructions for close outpatient follow-up.  Conclusion: Despite being on warfarin for a history of DVT  this patient still developed an acute PE  suggesting that compliance or drug efficacy may have been an issue. This case underscores the need for monitoring the effectiveness of anticoagulation treatment  dose adjustments  and patient education to prevent catastrophic presentations of PE. It is also a critical reminder of the need to have a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with recent or remote DVTs presenting with unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  or hemodynamic instability.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,55,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 52-Year-Old Caucasian Female Following Ankle Fracture: A Case Report  Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal condition with varied and often non-specific clinical presentations. This case report describes a 52-year-old Caucasian female with acute pulmonary embolism.  Case Description: A 52-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. The patient had a two pack-year smoking history  and an ankle fracture 6 weeks prior to presentation that was treated nonsurgically. She additionally experienced a complicated pregnancy and childbirth event at the age of 30  although no venous thromboembolism (VTE) events were recorded. Family history revealed her mother had experienced a stroke at the age of 67  but no other blood clotting disorders were reported. The patient held a sedentary desk job and reported limited physical activity.  On initial examination  the patient presented vital signs: heart rate at 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 128/82 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. Physical examination was notable for tachypnea and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. The right foot (site of previous fracture) showed no signs of redness  swelling or local warmth upon manual inspection.   Lab Results: The D-dimer test was significantly elevated at 1.6mg/L (normal range <0.5mg/L). Other labs  including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel  were within normal limits.  Imaging: A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed a large embolus located centrally in the left pulmonary artery. No other lung pathology was observed.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was promptly initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and then transitioned to oral apixaban  according to current guidelines. Oxygen supplementation was administered  improving her oxygen saturation to 96%. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved and she was discharged on apixaban with instructions to follow up in the outpatient thrombosis clinic.   Discussion: This case highlights how a common medical condition like ankle fracture  coupled with risk factors such as prolonged immobilization and smoking  can culminate into a potentially fatal condition like acute pulmonary embolism. Fast identification and treatment are crucial for a favorable prognosis in patients with PE  underscoring the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea.  Conclusion: Healthcare providers should consider pulmonary embolism as a differential diagnosis in patients with recent immobilization  previous VTE history or genetic predisposition  who present with respiratory symptoms unexplained by other causes. Early diagnosis and intervention can dramatically improve patient outcomes.  Keywords: Pulmonary embolism  Case report  D-dimer  Ankle fracture  Anticoagulation.

Vital signs included a pulse of 120 bpm  BP of 143/90 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right lower side. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.   The patient reported the sudden onset of sharp  right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath occurring at rest. She denied experiencing cough  hemoptysis  or lower extremity swelling. Patient revealed a history of a sedentary lifestyle  with her work mostly involving sitting for prolonged periods.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Immediate bloodwork showed an elevated D-dimer level of 900 ng/mL (Reference range 0-500 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block. CT pulmonary angiography confirmed right main pulmonary artery embolism.  History revealed she had been diagnosed six months back with DVT and had completed oral anticoagulation therapy. The patient was currently not on any prescribed prophylactic therapy.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous unfractionated heparin and administered supplemental oxygen. In view of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite prior therapy  further investigations planned were thrombophilia screen and echocardiogram.   Follow-Up:  Once stabilized  the patient was started on a direct oral anticoagulant for long-term VTE therapy  counseled on maintaining a healthy lifestyle  encouraged to lose weight  and recommended regular follow-ups.   Discussion:  This patient's clinical history underscores the importance of vigilance for PE in patients with a history of DVT  in the presence of known risk factors like obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. Tailored  prolonged anticoagulation therapy may be required in these patients to prevent recurrent VTE.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,61,Title: Case Report on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction: We report a case of a 55-year-old Caucasian male who presented at the Emergency Department with acute onset of dyspnea and chest pain suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Case Presentation: The patient  a 55-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presented to our hospital's emergency department. He reported an acute onset of dyspnea  chest pain  and mild cough with occasional hemoptysis that had begun a few hours prior. The patient had not traveled or been immobile for long periods recently. He was a non-smoker and drank alcohol socially. He was on anti-hypertensive medications and statins  and had undergone treatment for DVT two years back.  Clinical Findings: Upon initial assessment  the patient was anxious with a heart rate of 110 beats/minute  a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  arterial blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination  the patient exhibited mild tachypnea and tachycardia  but the cardiovascular and respiratory systems examination was largely unremarkable. There was no leg swelling  redness or tenderness to suggest an ongoing DVT.   Diagnosis: Given the patient's history and presentation  there was a high suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism which was substantiated by an elevated D-dimer level. A subsequent Spiral CT scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the left pulmonary artery. No secondary signs of right heart strain or pulmonary infarction were seen.   Treatment: The patient was administered intravenous heparin in the emergency department. As the hemodynamic stability of the patient was at risk  he was admitted to the intensive care unit for closer observation and thrombolysis was performed. After stabilization  the patient was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy for long-term management.   Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient's symptoms improved markedly after initiating treatment  and he remained stable throughout his hospital stay. He was discharged on oral anticoagulant therapy with specific instructions regarding compliance and follow-up. At a 6-month follow-up  the patient was symptom-free and had no signs of recurrence on imaging.  Discussion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of acute pulmonary embolism  especially in patients with a history of DVT. While DVT and PE are a part of the same disease spectrum  this case also highlights that PE can occur in isolation without obvious signs of DVT. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,62,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Male with Past Medical History of Thrombophilia and Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:  This case report involves a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of thrombophilia  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  and inactive smoker recently presented in our emergency department with symptoms of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE).  Case Presentation:  The patient  from a middle-class urban residence  was previously diagnosed with Factor V Leiden mutation  a genetic disorder that leads to thrombophilia  or an increased tendency for thrombosis. His past history also revealed an episode of DVT in the left lower extremity four years ago. He was a smoker for 30 years but quit five years ago.  His chief complaints at presentation were sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration  and mild hemoptysis. He was also experiencing mild dizziness but denied any loss of consciousness  palpitations  or leg pain/swelling.  Physical examination demonstrated a heart rate of 102 beats per minute  blood pressure 128/78 mmHg  a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. He had bilateral crackles on lung auscultation and no signs of DVT on the leg examination.  Investigations:  Laboratory investigations disclosed an elevated D-Dimer level of 800 ng/mL (normal: 0-500 ng/mL). His full blood count  cardiac enzymes  liver function tests were within the normal range. In contrast  arterial blood gas analysis showed mild hypoxemia and hypocapnia  correlating with acute pulmonary embolism.  The preliminary diagnosis of APE was further confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which revealed filling defects in the distal left pulmonary artery and its branches.  Management:  The patient was administered supplemental oxygen and initiated on low molecular weight heparin as a bridge to warfarin. He was also given pain relief.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Over a 72-hour observation period in the hospital  the patient's symptoms gradually improved. His oxygen saturation stabilized  and the pain was under control. He was discharged on long-term anticoagulation with warfarin  considering his prior history of DVT and current episode of APE.  Discussion:  The present case highlights the high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with genetic thrombophilia. Despite the patient being diligent about his medication regimen  lifestyle changes  he presented with a life-threatening condition. This reiterates the aggressive nature of inherited thrombophilias and the need for careful monitoring and management.  Patient consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.  Conclusion:  Early recognition and intervention in patients with suspected APE can drastically improve outcomes  particularly in patients with predisposing risk factors such as thrombophilia and history of DVT  as demonstrated in this case.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,63,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle Aged Caucasian Female Patient with History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  This case report refers to a 47-year-old Caucasian woman  a homemaker by profession  residing in the Midwestern United States. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic and leads a largely sedentary lifestyle due to her occupation. She also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with her father and grandmother having suffered from heart attacks.  History of Present Illness: The patient was brought to the hospital's emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain that began earlier in the evening. The accompanying chest pain was sharp  pleuritic in nature and radiating to the back  aggravated by breathing  and slightly relieved by sitting and leaning forward. She also reported palpitations and lightheadedness. She denied fever  cough  sputum production  wheezing  nausea  vomiting  or any abdominal pain.  Past Medical History: The patient had a history of hospitalization for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg treated with anticoagulants two years ago. She ceased therapy six months after being discharged  stating she felt well. She also has a known diagnosis of hypertension  controlled with metoprolol  and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism for which she takes levothyroxine. She also reported regular use of oral contraceptives.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  the patient appeared distressed and in pain. Vital signs were significant for tachycardia (heart rate: 110 bpm)  tachypnea (respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min)  oxygen saturation of 95% on room air  and normal temperature and blood pressure. There was no leg swelling or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Blood tests showed an elevated D-dimer. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block  and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of Pulmonary embolism. Chest radiograph was normal. CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of a clot in her left pulmonary artery.  Treatment and Outcome: Given her critical condition  the patient was immediately administered oxygen and anticoagulants to stabilize her before obtaining CT scan confirmation of the diagnosis. Treatment was continued with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  followed by a direct oral anticoagulant to be continued as long-term therapy. Her state improved gradually over the next few days with a decrease in chest pain  breathlessness  and an improvement in oxygen saturation levels.  Conclusion: This case delineates the potential risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with inactive lifestyles  a past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  use of oral contraceptives  and a sedentary work profile. PE high risk should prompt immediate action  and management should be aggressive involving life-saving measures  when necessary. Multidisciplinary care  patient education about continuation of long-term anticoagulant therapy is important to prevent morbidity and potential recurrence. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,64,Title: Acute Pulley Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged African-American Male with Past Medical History of Venous Thromboembolism  Patient Profile: Mr. J is a 57-year-old African-American male who is a resident of Dallas  Texas. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He has a sedentary job as an accountant  has no known drug allergies  and is currently on anti-hypertensive medication for managing his high blood pressure. He has a known past medical history of venous thromboembolism.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. J presented at the emergency department (ED) with a complaint of sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and the feeling of fast heart rate that had developed a few hours before his visit to the ED.   Clinical Findings: On examination  Mr. J was found to be tachypneic and tachycardic. His pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 142/90 mmHg  and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 92% in the room air. He appeared anxious and his heart sounds were tachycardic but rhythmic with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Investigations: A series of diagnostic studies were initiated  which included chest radiography  electrocardiogram (ECG)  Doppler ultrasound of the legs  D-dimer test  and Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA). The CTPA confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Treatment: Anti-coagulation therapy was immediately initiated with low molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulant warfarin. He was also provided supportive care with oxygen and pain-management therapy. The therapeutic goal was to maintain oxygen saturation >90% and relieve his chest pain.   Outcome: Mr. J symptoms gradually improved over a period of two days with adequate anticoagulation  following which he was discharged from the hospital with oral anticoagulant therapy and a schedule for regular blood test monitoring.  Follow-Up: In addition to setting up regular follow-ups with the local physician for monitoring his INR level  Mr. J was advised to change his lifestyle aimed at preventing future venous thromboembolic events.   Discussion: Pulmonary embolism carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity  particularly in patients with past histories of venous thromboembolism like Mr. J. The literature indicates racial differences in the incidence of venous thromboembolism  with African-Americans reported to have a higher incidence when compared to Caucasians. The rapid recognition of the symptoms followed by immediate therapeutic interventions were essential in managing the acute pulmonary embolism  thus further emphasizing the importance of awareness among physicians related to the increased predisposition in certain racial groups.  This case thus highlights the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with sudden-onset dyspnea  especially in those with past medical histories of thromboembolic events and those belonging to high-risk racial groups.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,65,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Caucasian Female Patient  Case Information:  Patient: 63-year-old Caucasian female Location: Urban tertiary healthcare center in Birmingham  Alabama  USA  Patient History and Clinical Scenario:  Ms. B  a 63-year-old Caucasian female with a history of obesity (BMI of 34)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presented to the Emergency Department complaining of acute onset shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and light-headedness. She denied any recent traveling history  surgeries  immobilization  or history of cancer. She is a postmenopausal non-smoker with no family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). She had been compliant with her medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  the patient was anxious and diaphoretic with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute  blood pressure of 136/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturations of 94% on room air. Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregular rhythm  with no murmurs  increased jugular venous pressure  and bilateral lower limb pitting edema. Lung sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.  Investigative Studies:  Her ECG revealed S1Q3T3 pattern suggesting acute right ventricle strain. Her D-dimer test came back elevated at 1000 ng/mL (normal range <500 ng/mL). Blood work showed a mildly elevated troponin-I level at 0.09 ng/mL (normal range <0.04 ng/mL). Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  The patient underwent CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) which confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism.   Management and Outcome:  The patient was started immediately on therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin and transitioned to long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. She was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and her condition significantly improved over 5 days  and she was discharged with follow-up outpatient appointments.  Discussion:  The case underlines the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute shortness of breath and chest pain  particularly in those who have risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. It also shows the value of early diagnosis and immediate anticoagulation therapy in enhancing the prognosis of these patients.  While this patient lacked several common risk factors for pulmonary embolism  such as recent surgery  immobilization  active malignancy  trauma  or family history of VTE  her elevated BMI and underlying cardiovascular risk factors may have made her susceptible. This case illustrates that clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for PE  even in the absence of typical risk factors.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,66,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report.  Patient Profile: Ms. X  a 63-year-old Caucasian woman  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. She is a lifelong non-smoker with no known drug or food allergies. She is post-menopausal and had undergone Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for menopause symptoms during the previous years.  Description of Patient's Symptoms: Ms. X reported a sudden onset of centrally located chest pain  described as 'heavy ' radiating to her left shoulder. She described the pain as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale  severe enough to cause significant discomfort. Along with this  she reported experiencing shortness of breath and an unexplained sense of apprehension. She denied any history of trauma  recent surgeries  or prolonged immobilization.  Medical Examination and Findings: On examination  Ms. X exhibited signs of respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. Her pulse rate was high at 115 bpm  and her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/95 mmHg. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) on room air was found to be 90%. No obvious lower limb swelling or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms and medical history  a working diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) was made. An urgent D-Dimer test was ordered  which came out high. Other laboratory tests such as complete blood count  renal function test  and cardiac markers were also collected. Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right main pulmonary artery  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Treatment and Outcome: Ms. X was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy along with continuous oxygen support. After initial stabilization  the patient was transitioned onto oral anticoagulation therapy. The patient's condition improved over the next few days  and she was discharged home on an extended course of oral anticoagulation therapy. Her hormone replacement therapy was discontinued  considering it as a risk factor for venous thrombosis.   Patient Education and Follow-up: She was educated about the signs and symptoms of recurrent PE and DVT. Regular follow-ups were scheduled with her primary physician for monitoring of her anticoagulation therapy.  This case report exemplified that post-menopausal women on hormone therapy could be at an increased risk for acute pulmonary embolism and enforced the need for early detection and prompt treatment.

He lives with his wife and has a five-year smoking history  having quit 15 years ago. He is currently on antihypertensive treatment for controlled hypertension and has a past medical history significant for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) three years ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease but no family history of genetic thrombophilias.   Clinical Findings: The patient presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest discomfort since the last six hours. The patient's vitals were monitored and he was found to be tachycardic and hypoxic with respective heart rate and oxygen saturation values of 110 beats/min and 92%. On physical examination  there was mild lower extremity edema. Lung auscultating revealed mild wheezing.  Timeline: The patient had a similar complaint three years ago  which led to the diagnosis of DVT. Following DVT diagnosis and management  he was asymptomatic until the presentation of these new symptoms.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the history of DVT and new onset dyspnea  there was strong suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). An electrocardiogram (EKG) was ordered that showed sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern hinting towards acute PE. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was done  where filling defects were seen in segmental branches of the right and left pulmonary arteries confirming the diagnosis of PE.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous heparin drip for anticoagulation in view of acute PE and admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Concurrently  he was given supplemental oxygen therapy for hypoxia.  Follow Up & Outcomes: After a week of heparin therapy  the patient's symptoms improved gradually and he was transitioned to oral anticoagulants. A discussion about a long-term anticoagulant plan was made given his history of DVT and the recent PE event. The patient was discharged with a six-month supply of rivaroxaban and was scheduled for regular follow-up checks.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed his relief and gratitude for the successful management of his condition and agreed to adhere to the recommended medical advice and follow-ups to prevent recurrence of such events in the future.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,69,Title: A Case Report of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged African-American Female  Introduction:  This case report presents a 55-year-old African-American female with a history of obesity  hypertension  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  who was admitted to the emergency department due to sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.  Case Description:  Ms. N  a 55-year-old African-American female living in South Chicago and working as a data analyst  presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp chest pain that worsened upon deep inhalation. She reported that she noticed increasing swelling and a throbbing pain in her left lower leg over the past week  which she initially attributed to her sedentary lifestyle but didn't seek medical help until her conditions exacerbated.  Her past medical history revealed hypertension for which she was on Lisinopril 10 mg daily  obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32  and a single episode of DVT three years ago that was managed with medications. Family history was notable for a maternal grandmother who experienced unexplained recurrent DVTs.  Upon arrival at the hospital  Ms. N appeared anxious and in respiratory distress. She exhibited tachypnea with respirations of 28 per minute  measured oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  and her blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg. Physical examination revealed an overweight woman in acute distress  with left calf tenderness  warmth  and swelling.   Investigation:  D-dimer test was significantly raised with a level of 1500 ng/ml. In light of the patient's symptoms and past medical history  duplex ultrasonography was performed immediately  revealing a deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal vein. Subsequent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Management and Outcome:  Ms. N was started on oxygen therapy and intravenous unfractionated heparin was initiated for the acute management of her embolism. She was subsequently started on warfarin with a plan for long-term anticoagulation therapy  considering her prior history of DVT. After a few days of hospitalization  her symptoms markedly improved. She was then discharged with close follow-ups planned for monitoring her INR and adjustment of her warfarin dosage. Ms. N was also counselled about the relationship between obesity and DVT and was encouraged to lose weight and lead an active lifestyle.  Discussion:  This case illustrates a typical presentation of an acute pulmonary embolism  with a classic risk profile: African American race  female  middle-aged  obese  sedentary profession  history of DVT  and family history of unprovoked DVT. The patient's delay in seeking health care suggests the necessity for patient education regarding the signs and symptoms of DVT and PE.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt management of pulmonary embolism. It also underscores the significance of public health education about its risk factors and symptoms  especially for individuals who have a high risk profile. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,70,Patient's Identification: 60-year-old African-American male. Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Past Medical History: Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension.  Presenting Problem:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath accompanied by chest pain for almost 30 to 40 minutes. The chest pain was of sudden onset and predominantly located in the central region of the chest  radiating occasionally towards the left arm. The chest pain was sharp in quality and was consistent. It was not aggravated or relieved by any factors. The patient had no prior history of similar pain. The shortness of breath was moderate in severity and was not accompanied by any cough or expectoration.  Emergency Findings:  Upon physical examination  the patient was alert and oriented but visibly distressed due to shortness of breath. Vitals showed tachycardia with heart rate at 110 beats per minute  systolic blood pressure at 140 mmHg  temperature at 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit and respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation level hovered around 90% on room air. Chest examination revealed reduced air entry at lung bases  with no wheezes or crepitations. Other system examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations and Results:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. Considering the presentation and examination findings  the patient was immediately assessed for possible pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer level was significantly increased. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was done  which showed large thrombus in the bilateral pulmonary arteries with right heart strain  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Management:  The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation with parenteral heparin and then transitioned to long-term oral rivaroxaban. The chest pain and shortness of breath improved over the next couple of days. The patient's vitals stabilized  oxygen saturation improved  and he was discharged after 5 days with instructions for strict adherence to medication and regular follow-up visits.  Discussion:  This case highlights the acute presentation of pulmonary embolism in an African-American man who has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Literature warrants the evaluation of risk factors such as immobilization  recent surgery  known malignancy  and inherited thrombophilic conditions in these patients. Considering the increasing global burden of pulmonary embolism and associated risk factors  prompt diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. Hence  implementing the appropriate preventive strategies is imperative to reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism among high-risk individuals.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the critical need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism. In high-risk groups such as middle-aged African-Americans with comorbid conditions  a heightened index of suspicion is necessary. Future research should focus on identifying more effective and efficient preventive strategies to reduce the prevalence and mortality associated with acute pulmonary embolism.   *This case report respects all ethical guidelines and personal data has been anonymized to maintain patient confidentiality.*
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,71,Title: An Uncommon Presentation of Acute Pulinary Embolism: A Case Report  I. Introduction  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition usually caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from the venous system  presenting with symptoms including breathlessness  chest pain  cough  palpitation and hemoptysis. We report a case of a 59-year-old man with a non-typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism.  II. Patient Information  The patient's initials are M.R  a 59-year-old caucasian male from a suburban locality. He is an ex-smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history and has now quit for five years. M.R is a retired  heavy-set construction worker with a BMI of 32  falling within the category of obese class I. He lives with his wife  has a moderate intake of alcohol  and follows a regular sedentary lifestyle.  III. Clinical Findings  M.R was brought into the emergency department presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath  palpitations and light-headedness. He had no chest pain  cough  or hemoptysis. Vital signs were stable  oxygen saturation hovered around 94% on room air and slight tachycardia was observed.  IV. Timeline  His symptoms began abruptly two days ago  with intervals of respite. However  on the day of admission  they persisted and gradually worsened  which prompted his visit to the ED. In his medical history  he had hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) six years ago. He was not currently on any anticoagulants as his DVT resolved on treatment with Warfarin and subsequent follow ups showed no recurrence.  V. Diagnostic Assessment  Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels and an ECG showed sinus tachycardia. A CT pulmonary angiogram was conducted based on the clinical suspicion which confirmed the presence of bilateral pulmonary emboli with right heart strain. An ultrasound of lower extremities revealed no signs of DVT.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention  Based on the diagnosis  M.R was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring. Due to right heart strain seen on the CT  he was considered for thrombolysis  however  decision was made to await further signs of clinical deterioration.  VII. Follow up and Outcome  M.R's symptoms gradually improved over the next 48 hours. Anticoagulation was bridged to warfarin with plans to continue for the long term considering his previous DVT history. Patient was discharged on fifth day of hospitalization with no immediate complications.   VIII. Take-away  This case highlights the variable presentation of acute PE. The contrast between patient's moderate symptoms and severe imaging findings emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE  especially in patients with significant risk factors.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,72,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-aged Male Patient - A Case Report  Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a cardiovascular emergency characterized by the blockage of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by a blood clot. The incidence of PE is reported as 70-120 cases per 100 000 individuals annually. Individuals over the age of 40 are particularly susceptible  and it is more common in males than in females.  Patient Information: Mr. X is a 54-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain for the last six hours. The patient is a heavy smoker with a 30-pack-year history and consumes alcohol moderately. There was no previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or PE. There are no additional significant familial predispositions.  Clinical Findings: The patient appeared anxious  dyspneic  and his oxygen saturation was measured at 88% (normal range: 95-100%) on room air. His blood pressure was 150/85 mm Hg and his pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (normal: 12-20)  and reduced breath sounds on the left side. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Given the clinical suspicion of PE  a D-dimer assay was performed  which came back elevated (800 ng/mL; normal: <500 ng/mL)  suggestive of a coagulation process. Subsequently  computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed which revealed a large embolus obstructing the left pulmonary artery. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia but no evidence of strain or ischemia. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors were further evaluated with a lipoprotein profile  which showed hypercholesterolemia.  Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Treatment and Outcome: Mr. X was treated promptly with anticoagulants (Unfractionated heparin was initiated immediately followed by Oral rivaroxaban). Oxygen therapy was initiated to combat hypoxia. His shortness of breath and chest pain improved over the course of 72 hours. He was instructed to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for PE in patients presenting with acute and unexplained dyspnea  particularly with risk factors like tobacco smoking  male gender  and middle age. Early recognition and treatment significantly impact patient outcomes positively. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,73,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Caucasian Woman with a Leiden Thrombophilia Past Medical History  Patient Information: Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian woman living in a Mid-western state in the US. She is a retired school teacher  leading a relatively sedentary lifestyle. The patient is non-smoker and maintains a moderate alcohol consumption. Her past medical history is notable for Factor V Leiden thrombophilia. She is currently receiving warfarin therapy as prophylaxis against thrombosis. Her medication adherence has been reliable.  Clinical Findings: The patient attended the ER with sudden onset of sharp  severe chest pain which she rated as 8/10 on a pain scale. The pain started while she was watching TV and was accompanied by shortness of breath. It was not associated with any exertion. The patient also reported light-headedness  mild palpitations and a cough productive of frothy sputum. There was no history of fever  recent surgeries or long-distance travel.  Diagnostic Assessment: On presentation  her blood pressure was 136/89 mmHg  pulse 104 bpm  temperature 36.9°C  respirations 22 breaths/min and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Physical examination was significant for tachypnea  tachycardia  and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe of the lung.  Initial laboratory investigations  including complete blood count  renal and liver function tests  were within normal limits. However  her D-dimer levels were markedly elevated at 5000 ng/mL. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a normal sinus rhythm  but with an S1Q3T3 pattern  raising a suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE).  A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of bilateral segments of pulmonary embolism with a right ventricular to left ventricular ratio suggesting right ventricular strain. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) additionally revealed right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis which further affirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was emergently started on parenteral anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin upon suspicion of PE. Once the diagnosis was confirmed  systemic thrombolytic therapy was initiated. The patient also received supplemental oxygen to manage her hypoxemia  and her hypotension was stabilized using fluid resuscitation.   Follow-Up and Outcome: The patient showed progressive clinical improvement with a significant reduction in her chest pain and improvement in breathlessness over the subsequent 48 hours. Oxygen saturation improved to 96% on room air and her vitals stabilized. A repeat echocardiogram showed an improvement in right ventricular function. Long-term oral anticoagulation therapy was planned after discussion with a hematologist.  Learning Points/Discussion: This case underscores the importance of early suspicion and immediate management of pulmonary embolism  especially among patients with a history of thrombophilic conditions. Regular monitoring of anticoagulants to maintain therapeutic levels is critical to prevent complications. Clinicians should be vigilant in assessing PE in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,75,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 55-year-old Male with Sedentary Lifestyle and Chronic Venous Insufficiency  Case Report: Patient Profile  The patient under discussion is a white male of 55 years of age  residing in the urban regions of Texas  USA. He is a retired software professional  follows a sedentary lifestyle  and has a high body mass index (BMI) of 35 indicating obesity. The patient is a non-smoker and abstains from alcohol. His family history is negative for any cardiovascular or respiratory disorders.  Presenting Complaints  The patient visited the emergency department with the primary complaint of acute onset shortness of breath which deteriorated in the previous 24 hours. He also reported experiencing mild chest pain radiating to his left shoulder. The patient displayed signs of anxiety and stress but was cognizant.  Past Medical History  The patient’s medical history reveals long-standing chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in the lower limbs  diagnosed 8 years ago. He was inconsistently compliant with prescribed compression therapy and physical exercises. There is no history of any surgery. The patient also reported being on an over-the-counter aspirin regimen initiated himself around three months ago.  Clinical Examination  On evaluation  the patient's vital signs were unstable  with tachycardia (heart rate of 115 beats/minute)  tachypnea (respiratory rate of 28 breaths/minute)  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The chest examination showed decreased breath sounds with crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally. The low extremities displayed the presence of edema  varicose veins  skin changes consistent with CVI  and no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Investigation & Diagnosis  Due to high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE)  a D-dimer assay was ordered that came out to be significantly raised. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism with multiple emboli in both pulmonary arteries. Venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs implied deep venous thromboses.  Management & Outcome  The patient was initially managed with oxygen therapy  analgesics  anticoagulant (low molecular weight Heparin)  and fluid resuscitation. After stabilization  oral anticoagulant therapy (Apixaban) was initiated. The patient has been advised on weight loss strategies  regular exercise  and the importance of compliance with CVI management to prevent PE incidences in the future.  This case report underscores the significant risk of PE among populations with a sedentary lifestyle and those with long-term vascular disorders such as CVI. Regular follow-up and adherence to medical recommendations is critical in managing these risk factors.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,77,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 40-Year-Old Female With Prior Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction: This case report presents a 40-year-old Caucasian female presenting with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). PE represents the third most common cause of cardiovascular death  with incidence rates varying across different regions  ethnicities and risk patient groups.  Case Presentation: This is a case of a 40-year-old female with a previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  presenting to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and significant loss of consciousness. The patient was conscious but visibly distressed upon arrival. She is a known smoker  with a 25-pack-year history but no significant alcohol or illicit drug use. She does not take oral contraceptives and has no personal or family history of malignant disease.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats per minute and saturating 89% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the lung bases bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable apart from tachycardia. Lower limb examination revealed no signs of DVT. ECG showed sinus tachycardia  right axis deviation  and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute right heart strain.   Investigations: D-dimer test came back significantly elevated at 2000 ng/mL. A CT pulmonary angiogram was immediately performed  which confirmed the presence of a large saddle embolus in the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery  extending into the left and right pulmonary arteries. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs revealed a superficial femoral vein thrombus on the right side.  Treatment: The patient was immediately administered therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Emergent thrombolysis was considered; however  significant improvements in the patient’s clinical status over the next 24 hours negated the need for this intervention.  Outcome and Follow-Up: During the hospital stay  the patient was transitioned to oral direct-acting anticoagulants. She was discharged after 7 days and advised to continue anticoagulation therapy. Follow-up after 8 weeks showed no recurrence of PE or DVT.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance to maintain a high index of suspicion for acute PE in patients with past medical history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  presenting with acute symptoms of breathlessness  and chest pain. Early recognition and prompt treatment of this potentially fatal condition can significantly improve patient outcomes. Smoking cessation and appropriate long-term anticoagulation therapy remains key to reducing recurrence. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,78,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient's Information: - Age: 63 - Gender: Male - Racial Background: African American  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. A presented to the emergency room (ER) with a sudden onset of chest pain  unilateral leg swelling  and shortness of breath  which had worsened progressively over the last few hours.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  and hypertension for 15 years  both diseases are being under management with medications. He also has a history of knee replacement surgery on the right leg two months prior. He is currently smoking 10 cigarettes per day for the last 30 years and has a body mass index of 28.6 kg/m2  which indicates that he is overweight. There are no known allergies or drug interactions. The patient does not have a history of any other significant medical or surgical procedures.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  Mr. A was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  and respiratory rate was high at 26 breaths per minute with decreased oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On auscultation  crackles were heard halfway up the left lung field  and the right calf was slightly red  swollen  and tender upon touch.  Diagnosis:  Given the acute onset of symptoms  and past medical history including recent surgery  an initial diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed S1Q3T3 pattern characteristic of PE. D-dimer levels were elevated beyond normal range at 0.8 mcg/mL (normal:<0.5 mcg/mL). A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was then conducted  which demonstrated evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli predominantly at the left lung  confirming the suspected diagnosis.  Discussion:  The patient's recent knee replacement surgery might have contributed to a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which could have caused the PE. Moreover  his cigarette smoking and obesity  along with his chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension have definitely played a crucial role in this scenario. Immediate anticoagulation therapy was initiated  and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further monitoring and management.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of thorough risk stratification and prophylaxis in patients with multiple risk factors for DVT and PE. Management of chronic conditions and lifestyle modifications should be highly prioritized to prevent such complications in the future. Additionally  prompt recognition of the symptoms and quick initiation of adequate therapy are pivotal in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with PE.

History: The patient  an ex-smoker with a smoking history of 30-pack years  complained of acute onset  severe chest pain  and shortness of breath  which had worsened over the past 48 hours. He also reported occasional palpitations and dizzy spells. There was no noted fever  cough or weight loss. His medications included Metformin  Lisinopril  and Spiriva.  Clinical Examination: The patient exhibited increased respiratory rate (28/min) and blood pressure (158/96 mmHg)  while pulse rate and temperature were within normal limits. A physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower left lung. His BMI was measured at 27.8. His oxygen saturation on room air was noted to be 89%.  Investigations: A rapidly processed CT pulmonary angiogram revealed the presence of multiple large emboli in the left pulmonary artery branch while a D-Dimer test showed elevated levels of 590 ng/mL (>500 ng/mL is high). An electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed right bundle branch block (RBBB) with T wave inversions in V1-V4  possibly signaling right ventricular strain induced by increased pressures. In light of the patient’s medical history  a blood glucose level was also investigated  and it was found to be raised at 195 mg/dL.  Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) given the severity of his condition and the high risk of mortality. Therapeutic anticoagulation was promptly implemented using intravenous unfractionated heparin  and later transitioned to oral anticoagulants. The patient's diabetic status was managed with insulin therapy. The patient showed substantial improvement  with relief from chest pain and breathlessness over the following week.   Discussion: This case underscores that patients with existing comorbidities like COPD and diabetes are at an elevated risk for Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Furthermore  it reinforces the need for immediate clinical suspicion  diagnosis  and treatment in such high-risk cases  highlighting the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in managing Acute PE.  Conclusion: This case reiterates the vital importance of awareness regarding the lethal yet treatable nature of Acute Pulmonary Embolism. A prompt diagnosis  therapeutic interventions  and diligent monitoring play integral roles in circumventing fatality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,80,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-aged African American Male with Previous Smoking History   Patient Information: Mr. BW  an African American male aged 54  presented to the emergency room of a private hospital in Atlanta  Georgia. He is a divorced father of two adult children  works as a construction worker  and holds a private insurance plan. He smoked about a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but quit suddenly about a year ago when he was diagnosed with hypertension. He has not been compliant with his antihypertensive medications and doesn't have any other relevant past medical or surgical history.  Clinical Findings: Mr. BW reported sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness  which started approximately 3 hours before arriving at the hospital. He denied experiencing any cough  fever  or changes in bowel or bladder habits. Upon physical examination  Mr. BW appeared anxious  diaphoretic  and in obvious respiratory distress. Vital signs revealed a BP of 130/88 mmHg  pulse rate of 106 per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 90% on ambient air.  Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia  and chest radiography was unremarkable. The D-dimer level was found to be raised  and a subsequent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scan confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli  primarily in the lower lobes. An ultrasound of the lower extremities showed a left lower leg deep-vein thrombus.   Therapeutic Intervention: Emergency anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was commenced  which led to a gradual improvement in the patient's symptoms. After reviewing the patient's complete medical history  the decision was made to attempt outpatient treatment  given his relatively stable condition and familial support.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,81,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an Elderly Patient: A Clinical Case Report  Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries. Here  we present the clinical case of an elderly patient diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Patient Information: An 80-year-old Caucasian female  hailing from the urban region of Phoenix  Arizona  presented herself at the hospital emergency department complaining of sudden-onset dyspnea  chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. The patient lived alone and was mainly dependent on her greenhouse activities. She bore a history of hypertension and was a former smoker  having quit 15 years back. However  she had been physically inactive in recent times due to recent right hip fracture surgery.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was in acute distress  displaying tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min  tachycardia with a heart rate of 125 beats/min  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Reduced breath sounds were noted on the right lower lung field. Her body mass index (BMI) was 29  indicating obesity  which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the clinical presentation  an immediate bedside ECG was performed revealing signs of right heart strain. A D-dimer test was high and a spiral computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of a large acute pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery. Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound showed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower limb  suggesting the PE source.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on systemic thrombolytic therapy with intravenous heparin for acute PE. Subsequent to this  long-term oral anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated to prevent recurrence  after obtaining informed consent from the patient.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient improved dramatically with the resolution of symptoms and stabilized vital signs two days after the initiation of thrombolytic therapy. She was discharged on the 7th day of hospitalization with clear instructions on medication compliance  potential drug interactions  monitoring of Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR)  and potential signs of bleeding. She was encouraged to continue physical therapy for the hip fracture and follow a structured exercise plan.  Conclusion: The case report underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism  particularly in elderly patients with risk factors like obesity  recent surgery  and reduced mobility. It also emphasizes health education and patient counseling to reduce PE-related morbidity and mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,82,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 64-Year-Old African American Male  Introduction:  Mr. S is a 64-year-old  African American male who presented himself to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings:  The patient’s initial vitals showed a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. He was afebrile  with a temperature of 98.7°F. Acute sharp  substernal chest pain commenced suddenly and was associated with shortness of breath  and profuse sweating. Mr. S denied any recent long trips or immobilization  yet reported a prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) roughly ten years ago.  Case Management:  Given the presenting symptoms and his past medical history  there was a high index of suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). An immediate EKG was ordered which showed signs of right ventricular strain and possible right heart failure. A Doppler ultrasound performed showed no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Due to his rapid decline  a D-Dimer test was not performed on arrival. Instead  a Computerized Tomographic Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) was carried out  confirming the diagnosis of an acute PE  with evidence of substantial clot burden in both the left and right pulmonary arteries.   The patient was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where he was initiated on anticoagulant therapy with intravenous Heparin. This was followed by a switch to oral anticoagulant therapy per standard protocol. Invasive procedures like thrombectomy were considered but excluded due to the patient's persistent hemodynamic stability.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  Mr. S responded well to treatment  with a progressive reduction in symptoms over the following days. His oxygen saturation improved  and he was subsequently transferred out of the ICU. He was discharged on a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)  in addition to follow-up appointments with both the hospital's anticoagulation clinic and a pulmonologist.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute chest pain and/or unexplained dyspnea  especially patients with significant past medical history like DVT. The high African American mortality rate linked to cardiovascular disease further complexed by the prevalence among males and the older age bracket stresses the importance of speedy diagnosis and treatment.  Conclusion:  Our experience emphasizes the need for a thorough history and swift clinical judgment when acute PE is suspected. The development of structured PE protocol may escalate the speed of diagnosis and decrease observed disparities in at-risk groups  such as older African American male patients  minimizing morbidity and mortality rates.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,83,Title: A Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal African American Woman with Prior Medical History of Hypertension  Introduction: This report describes the case of a 67-year-old African American woman who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. The presentation was complicated by her previous medical history of hypertension.   Case Report: Ms. B is a 67-year-old African American female. She presented in the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp chest pain radiating to her left shoulder  which started earlier that day. She described her dyspnea as severe and the pain as each breath she took only worsened it. Associated symptoms included mild dizziness and slight cough but no hemoptysis. She denied trauma  recent travel or prior similar episodes. She has no history of smoking.  Past Medical History: Ms. B has a 15-year history of hypertension  well-controlled with lisinopril 20mg once daily. She had undergone menopause at the age of 52  and has no other known medical conditions. She denied any prior surgeries. She does not take oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. There is no personal or family history of blood disorders or previous venous thromboembolic events.   Investigations: A D-Dimer test was performed immediately  which was positive. In light of the clear clinical suspicion and positive D-dimer result  computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was immediately performed. CTPA showed a large clot burden in the lobar branches of both pulmonary arteries  most prominently in the right lower lobe.  Treatment and Progress: Ms. B was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Immediate management included oxygen therapy and intravenous heparin followed by Warfarin initiation with overlapping administration.  Outcome: With treatment  her dyspnea improved considerably over the next 48 hours. She was discharged home after one week in stable condition  with proper instructions about her medication and the importance of follow-up visits. In 3 months of follow-up  the patient remained free of signs and symptoms of recurrent pulmonary embolism.  Discussion: This case highlights the risk and presentation of acute pulmonary embolism in an elderly  post-menopausal African American woman. It is known that African American women face a 1.5-fold higher risk of venous thrombosis than Caucasian women (Tsai  Cushman  Rosamond  Heckbert  & Polak  2002).  Learning points: Consider pulmonary embolism even in the absence of explicit risk factors. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the outcome. Primary physicians should be aware of the higher risk of venous thrombosis among African American women  particularly in the presence of additional risk factors such as hypertension.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,84,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-Old Caucasian Female: A Case Report   Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that is often underdiagnosed. This case report presents a 65-year-old Caucasian female who was admitted to the hospital with acute pulmonary embolism.  Case Description:  A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms of shortness of breath and severe chest pain that had worsened over the past two days. The patient reported that her symptoms began suddenly and that she had no previous similar episodes. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She has been generally in good health and reported no allergies. Her past medical history revealed a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 10 years ago for which she had been on anticoagulation therapy for six months. She also has controlled hypertension for which she is taking Lisinopril. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease - her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 74.  During the physical examination  she appeared anxious and short of breath. Her vital signs were: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  temperature 37.2°C  and oxygen saturation 91% at room air. Cardiac sounds were tachycardic with no murmurs or gallops. Pulmonary auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated signs of sinus tachycardia but no other significant abnormalities. A chest X-ray initially appeared normal. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was subsequently ordered and showed a large embolus in the right main pulmonary artery. D-dimer levels were significantly elevated.  Diagnosis and Management: The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. She was immediately started on IV heparin and oral warfarin. Due to the size and location of the embolus  thrombolytic therapy was considered but not pursued due to an elevated risk of bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of clinical suspicion for PE in patients presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath  especially if they have a history of DVT or other risk factors for thromboembolism. An early and accurate diagnosis can significantly influence patient outcomes  mainly since the presentation of PE can be quite varied  thereby causing a delay or misdiagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,85,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 56-Year-Old Caucasian Female: A Case Report  Patient Information:   The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female. She has a previous medical history of hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis  which are managed with Lisinopril and Methotrexate respectively. The patient reports occasional tobacco usage but quit smoking 10 years ago. She has a family history of deep vein thrombosis  with her father suffering from a major episode a few years back. The patient is married  lives in a suburban area  is a retired school teacher and has a BMI of 27.8  placing her in the 'overweight' category.  Case Presentation:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset chest pain and breathlessness that started earlier that morning. The pain  she explained  worsened with deep breaths. Prior to this event  she implied no such conditions. On physical examination  she appeared anxious and short of breath with oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Vitals showed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 108 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient displayed signs of respiratory distress with increased heart rate. Lung auscultation reported reduced breath sounds in the lower right lobe. Laboratory findings indicated a high D-Dimer level suggestive of thrombus. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern which is associated with acute pulmonary embolism. Chest radiograph was normal.  Diagnosis:  Given the clinical presentations and the results from the EKG and laboratory tests  the patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was administered venous bolus unfractionated heparin and oral rivaroxaban was initiated immediately after making the diagnosis. O2 therapy was also started  and Lisinopril was held due to lowered blood pressure.   Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over the next few days. The breathlessness and chest pain subsided. After 5 days of hospital stay  she was discharged  advised to continue rivaroxaban  and scheduled for a follow-up in a week. The importance of maintaining a healthy BMI  along with other lifestyle modifications  was recommended.  Discussion:  Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal condition. The patient’s advanced age  hypertension  and family history appear to be contributory factors in her diagnosis along with her sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. The case emphasizes the need for recognizing potential risk factors for thromboembolic events and the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment in acute pulmonary embolism.

The patient was independent and had no known underlying medical conditions and no known drug allergies  but had a history of smoking about 10 cigarettes per day for the last 50 years. Her family reported that she had been increasingly sedentary in the days prior to her presentation due to a self-limiting episode of flu-like illness.  Vital signs on arrival to the ED were: heart rate  110 beats per minute; blood pressure  145/85 mmHg; respiratory rate  26 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation  90% on room air.  Medical History:  Besides her smoking history and recent flu-like illness  the patient has no past medical history of any chronic diseases like diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  or cardiovascular diseases. She has had no past surgical history. She was up to date with her routine health checks and wasn’t on any long-term medication. The patient's family history revealed that her father had died of ischemic heart disease in his late sixties  but there was no reported history of thromboembolic disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Her Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia with a S1Q3T3 pattern  suggestive of acute right heart strain. The initial differential diagnosis included acute coronary syndrome  lung consolidation  pneumothorax  and pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer assay was significantly raised  which mandated further evaluation for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis  showing multiple acute emboli in the lobar and segmental arteries of both lungs.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Following the diagnosis of PE  the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). She was initiated on low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) and oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. Her condition improved over the following days  with a decrease in dyspnea and chest pain and normalization of vital signs.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  Patient education was provided about the risk factors of PE  particularly smoking and prolonged immobility. She was subsequently discharged on rivaroxaban with instructions for appropriate follow-up visits with her primary care physician to adjust the dosage and monitor side effects of anticoagulation treatment  as well as to receive smoking cessation counseling. After three months  she was doing well with no recurrence of symptoms.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering PE in patients with sudden dyspnea and chest pain  even in those without a significant past medical history. The report also highlights the role of existing risk factors  like smoking and recent immobility  in the pathogenesis of PE. Continuous care and follow-up with physicians are essential to prevent recurrence and manage anticoagulation treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,87,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 67-year-old Female Patient  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female with past medical history marked by hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mrs. A  who is a retired schoolteacher  has been post-menopausal for 17 years. She lives with her husband in a suburban setting and is a former smoker with a 15-pack-year history  having quit 10 years ago.  Clinical Findings: Mrs. A consulted her primary care physician (PCP) regarding sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that she had been experiencing for the past 12 hours. The pain was described as pleuritic in nature. She also reported a recent history of a long road trip lasting 8 hours with limited mobility.  Diagnostic Assessment: Her PCP ordered a D-dimer test which came back elevated. An ECG showed a sinus tachycardia. Given the high suspicion of a pulmonary embolism (PE)  a CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered. The CT results revealed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery extending into the lower lobe branches  thus confirming a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on a course of anticoagulant therapy  specifically with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  and she was then transitioned to a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)  Rivaroxaban.   Follow Up and Outcome: Upon follow up after two weeks  the patient reported a significant reduction in symptoms  including chest pain and shortness of breath. She was advised to continue anticoagulant therapy for at least 6 months  and follow-up visits were scheduled for monitoring purposes.  Patient Perspective: Mrs. A expressed relief at her improved symptoms and agreed to strictly adhere to her medication regimen and follow-up appointments. She also pledged to avoid prolonged immobilization in the future.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  especially with known risk factors such as prolonged immobility (in this case  a long road trip)  advanced age  and a history of smoking. The patient responded well to immediate anticoagulant therapy  underscoring the effectiveness of this treatment in PE management. Continuity of care through regular follow-ups is also imperative to ensure optimum recovery and monitor for recurrence or complications.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,88,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 62-Year-old Female with a History of Hypertension  Abstract:  This case report profiles a 62-year-old African American female who presented with acute shortness of breath and chest pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This patient has a history of chronic hypertension  and the case brings to light the link between hypertension and the risk of developing PE.  Case Presentation:  Ms. A  a 62-year-old African American female with a history of poorly controlled hypertension presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain radiating to her left arm. This was associated with light-headedness and a single episode of syncope at her home a few hours prior to her arrival. She denied symptoms of fever  cough or recent traveling. She further reported non-use of oral contraceptives  a non-smoker  no recent surgeries  or immobilization. Per family members  the patient has been non-adherent to her hypertension medications in the past and her blood pressure had been inconsistently controlled. On taking her vitals  she was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation level of 88%  blood pressure of 170/95mmHg  heart rate of 105/min and a respiratory rate of 22/min.  Clinical Findings  Diagnostic Assessment and Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient appeared in acute distress. Physical examination revealed the patient to be tachycardic with distant heart sounds. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ST or T wave changes.   Given her symptoms  risk factors and findings  there was a high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer test was ordered  and it came back significantly elevated. A subsequent contrast CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.   Intravenous heparin was immediately started  and her oxygen saturation gradually improved with oxygen therapy. On stabilization  the patient was transitioned to oral anticoagulation therapy with Apixaban.   She was counseled on the relevance of medication adherence and hypertension control to her overall health. Additionally  she was educated on the signs and symptoms of PE and told to seek immediate medical attention should similar symptoms recur.  Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with sudden onset respiratory symptoms  particularly in those with significant risk factors such as poorly controlled hypertension. Early recognition  prompt diagnosis  and intervention are vital to improving outcomes in patients presenting with acute PE. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,89,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Woman with History of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is lethal if left undiagnosed and untreated. The disease  often a complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  frequently manifests as dyspnea  chest pain  or cough. Here  we present a case of a 62-year-old post-menopausal woman diagnosed with an acute PE following a medical history of DVT.  Case Report: Patient Description:  The patient is a Caucasian woman  aged 62  underweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18. She is a retired teacher living in an urban setting  leading a sedentary lifestyle. Her family history includes cardiovascular disease  with her father suffering a fatal myocardial infarction in his late 50s. The patient is a non-smoker but does have a history of alcohol consumption within moderate limits.  Medical History: Approximately 7 years ago  the patient was diagnosed with left-leg DVT. She underwent treatment with anticoagulants  following which her condition stabilized. Hypertension was also diagnosed  managed with amlodipine. The patient also has Type 2 diabetes  controlled through diet and metformin. Two years ago  she was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia  managed with statin therapy.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient reported to the ER with acute shortness of breath  chest pain exacerbated on deep inspiration  and bouts of cough. She also complained of feeling lightheaded  accompanied by an unnatural sense of doom.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Labs revealed elevated D-dimer  troponin  and BNP levels. An EKG showed right ventricular strain pattern.  Diagnostic Assessment: A chest CT angiogram showed a large clot burden in both pulmonary arteries. A lower limb venous Doppler confirmed the presence of DVT in the left leg. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed signs of acute pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular strain.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was promptly started on unfractionated heparin infusion with a plan to overlap and transition to oral anticoagulation. She was also started on supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.  Outcome: With anticoagulation and supportive care  her respiratory distress began to improve. She was successfully transitioned to oral rivaroxaban and discharged after 7 days of hospitalization with a target INR of 2.5 with strict follow-up scheduled.  This case serves as a reminder for clinicians to be cautious of PE  particularly in patients with history of DVT  and underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and immediate treatment for optimal outcomes. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,90,Title: Acute Pulomaury Embolism in a 65-year-old African-American Male with Comorbidities: A Case Report  Introduction:   Pulmonary embolism (PE)  a potentially life-threatening cardiovascular emergency  is an obstruction in a blood vessel in the lungs  often due to deep vein thrombosis. The incidence of PE is reportedly higher in African Americans than Caucasians. This report describes a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a 65-year-old African-American male with a history of chronic diseases.  Case Presentation:  The patient  Mr. X  a 65-year-old African-American male presented at our Emergency Department (ED)  complaining of sudden onset chest pain radiating to his left arm  shortness of breath  hemoptysis  and dizziness. The pain was severe enough to wake him from sleep. He reported no recent surgeries  long period of immobility  or international travel.  His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and clinically controlled hypertension for the past ten years. He had a past smoking history but had quit 5 years ago. He had a familial history of cardiac diseases. On current medications  he was receiving metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension.  Physical examination revealed a slightly obese man (body mass index of 30.7 kg/m2) in acute distress. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 115 per minute  respiratory rate 22 per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. The respiratory system and cardiovascular system examination revealed tachypnea and tachycardia but no signs of heart failure.  Investigations:  His laboratory tests revealed an increased D-dimer (3 080 ng/mL). The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right ventricular strain. Chest X-ray was normal. Subsequently  a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography was performed  revealing a large clot obstructing his left pulmonary artery suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment:  Mr. X was immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and oral anticoagulation was initiated. His tachypnea and chest pain improved significantly. He remained stable and was discharged on rivaroxaban after a few days.  Discussion:  The case of Mr. X emphasizes the necessity of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients who present with sudden chest pain and shortness of breath  especially those with risk factors.  Conclusion:  High clinical suspicion and aggressive workup for PE need to be maintained in older  African-American males with cardiovascular risk factors. Mr. X's case reiterates the importance of considering PE in differential diagnoses in patients having risk factors  despite them being under medication for other primary diseases  and the prompt initiation of treatment is crucial. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,91,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male: A Case Report   Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially life-threatening disease. It occurs when blood clots travel from the veins in the legs or pelvis to the arteries in the lungs  leading to pulmonary artery occlusion.   Case Presentation: A 55-year-old Caucasian male  with a resident status in the USA  presented to a city hospital emergency department with severe shortness of breath and chest pain exacerbating over six hours. The patient also reported a two-day history of lower extremity edema and mild discomfort in his right calf. His demographic profile is representative of the well-documented predisposition of acute pulmonary embolism among middle-aged adults  particularly men.  Patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension  slightly controlled with medication  and a 30-pack-year smoking history leading to chronically obstructed lung disease. The patient denied having a family history of venous thromboembolic disease or a personal history suggestive of a coagulation disorder.  On examination  he appeared distressed and pale  with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute  heart rate 130 beats per minute  blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturations of 88% on room air. Cardiac examination showed tachycardia while chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds  with no wheeze or crackles.  Investigations: Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels (2500 ng/mL; normal <500 ng/mL) and mildly raised troponin-T levels (30 ng/L; normal <14 ng/L). The arterial blood gas showed hypoxemia and hypocapnia (pO2 60 mmHg  pCO2 31 mmHg). The electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern.  A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram confirmed a large saddle embolus straddling the main pulmonary artery bifurcation  extending into the right and left main pulmonary arteries  with secondary right ventricular strain  affirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Treatment: The patient was commenced on supplemental oxygen and initially treated with unfractionated heparin. After pertinent discussions with vascular surgery and interventional radiology  due to the extensive size of the embolus and hemodynamic instability  he underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis with marked clinical and hemodynamic improvement.   Conclusion: This case report underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment of pulmonary embolism. Despite a common assumption of PE mainly affecting hospitalized or immobile patients  this case feature emphasizes that PE can affect community-dwelling individuals with common risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. It also encourages an increased index of suspicion for PE in patients with risk factors who present with respiratory distress  even in the absence of a clear history of deep vein thrombosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,92,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Patient with Hypertension and Obesity: A Case Report  Introduction: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a cardiovascular disease that primarily stems from deep venous thrombosis. It is the third leading cause of cardiovascular deaths worldwide. This case report presents the event of PE in an adult patient with contributory factors such as hypertension and obesity.  Case Presentation: A 57-year-old African-American male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of sudden and acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations that had begun a few hours prior. The patient also disclosed a history of persistent cough and unusual opportunity fatigue for the previous two weeks. He had no history of travel  surgery  or injury in the recent past.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and obesity five years ago. He was on regular antihypertensive medications (Lisinopril 10mg once daily) and had been advised lifestyle modifications for his obesity. However  he confessed to having irregular adherence to both medication and recommended lifestyle changes. There was no history of diabetes  respiratory diseases  or heart diseases. His Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as 32 kg/m2  indicating obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2).   Physical Examination: The initial examination revealed a noticeable tachycardia with an irregular heartbeat  tachypnea  and hypertension. Despite the raised blood pressure  no other cardiac abnormalities were noted during the initial physical examination. Chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally.  Investigations: Due to the suspicion of acute PE  a comprehensive diagnostic workup was initiated  which included a D-dimer test that returned as highly positive. An electrocardiogram showed signs of acute right heart strain. A subsequent Computerised Tomographic Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of PE  revealing a large embolus located centrally in the pulmonary artery.  Management: The patient was immediately taken to the intensive care unit and started on intravenous unfractionated heparin. After stabilization  he was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy (Rivaroxaban).  Discussion: The presence of obesity and hypertension in the patient significantly increased the risk of developing PE. Although regular antihypertensive medication was recommended  his history indicated irregularity in medicine intake  which could have contributed to poor hypertension management and increased PE risk.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of regular antihypertensive medication intake and the severe implications of lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and obesity in developing acute PE. Regular follow-ups for optimum management of these conditions can substantially reduce the incidence of severe thromboembolic events.   
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,93,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-Year-Old African-American Female with No Prior History of Thromboembolic Diseases: A Case Report  Introduction:  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal condition with significant diversity in its demographic epidemiology. Up to 15% of all sudden deaths are due to PE and it is the third most common cause of hospital-related death.   Case Presentation:  We present the case of a 65-year-old African-American woman with no known prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and lightheadedness.  History and Examination:  The patient was an active  social smoker with a 20 pack-year history and had an incidental finding of hypertension two years ago  controlled with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medication. Her body mass index (BMI) was 32. She had family history of stroke in her father. She denied any recent extensive travel  surgery  immobilization  or hormonal therapy.   Physical examination revealed that she was in moderate respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and SpO2 of 88% on room air. Her blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 and heart rate was 110 bpm.  Investigations:   Laboratory findings showed an elevated D-dimer level of 1200 ng/mL (normal range: 0-500 ng/mL)  and a certain troponin increase. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph was unremarkable. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was promptly performed that confirmed the diagnosis - revealing multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right middle lobe and the left lower lobe pulmonary arteries  consistent with acute bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Management and Follow-up:   The patient was admitted to the ICU and managed with supplemental oxygen and intravenous unfractionated heparin. After stabilization  she was transitioned to oral Rivaroxaban. During her hospital stay  screening for malignancy and hypercoagulable states were negative. The hospital course was uncomplicated  and she was discharged in stable condition with continued anticoagulation therapy.   Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism as a differential even in seemingly low-risk individuals. A comprehensive history  wary suspicion  and swift investigative protocol are essential in diagnosing and managing such potentially fatal conditions. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,94,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Menopausal Female: A Case Report  Introduction:   Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates around the globe. Its demographic representation varies widely  but it predominantly affects returning males and older  post-menopausal women. Here  we present the case of a 62-year-old female presented with acute pulmonary embolism.  Patient Information and Clinical Findings:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female from New York  NY  a retired school teacher with no history of smoking or chronic alcohol use. She has a past medical history of hypertension  obesity  and total hysterectomy at 53 due to uterine fibroids  and she has never been on hormone replacement therapy. Originally presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and lightheadedness lasting over two hours  her initial vital signs were notable for tachycardia (pulse rate 110 beats per minute)  tachypnea (respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute)  and normal blood pressure (120/80 mmHg).  Diagnostic Assessment:  An immediate ECG showed a sinus tachycardia with a S1Q3T3 pattern  suggestive of pulmonary embolism. D-dimer test was ordered for the patient  with results exceeding 500 ng/ml (normal range: <250 ng/ml). Chest radiography displayed no significant findings. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of filling defects within bilateral pulmonary arteries  cementing the diagnosis as acute pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention & Follow Up:  The patient was urgently started on intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin and admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. Over the next several days  her breathing gradually improved and her heart rate stabilized. Given her increased risk of recurrence  a transition was made from heparin to long-term oral anticoagulation with warfarin  endeavored for at least 3 months. Appropriate dose adjustment was made to achieve a target INR of 2-3. She was discharged after one week. On a follow-up visit six weeks later  she continued to improve symptomatically with a satisfactory INR level of 2.3.  Conclusion:  This case is a reminder that while acute pulmonary embolism can be a lethal condition  prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. In patients with risk factors  such as older age  post-menopausal status  a history of surgery and underlying co-morbidities like hypertension and obesity  healthcare providers need to maintain a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism when presenting symptoms such as dyspnea  chest pain  and tachycardia exist. Multidisciplinary management is key in reducing complications and mortality in APE. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,95,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Previously Healthy Middle-Aged Caucasian Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that is often underdiagnosed due to its nonspecific clinical manifestations. This report presents an unusual case of acute PE in a previous healthy middle-aged Caucasian female and aims to highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment.  Patient Information: The patient  a 54-year-old Caucasian female  with no significant known medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  unexplained fatigue  and intermittent sharp  stabbing chest pain increasing with deep breaths for the past two days. She affirmed not to smoke  consume alcohol or illicit substances  nor was she under any regular medication. The patient was unemployed and lived with her husband  not reporting recent travels  hospitalizations  surgeries  or immobilization.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient appeared acutely dyspneic. Vital signs revealed tachypnea at a rate of 28 breaths per minute  blood pressure was 128/80 mmHg  temperature 37.2°C  pulse 105 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation were 91% on room air. Her lungs had decreased breath sounds on the right base  and no leg swelling or calf tenderness was noted.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood investigations showed D-dimer of 750 ng/mL (normal: <500 ng/mL). A CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a large filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery suggesting a PE. Further hypercoagulability workup  including Factor V Leiden  antithrombin III activity  anticardiolipin antibodies  and prothrombin mutation  was negative  suggesting an unprovoked PE.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy with intravenous heparin  followed by oral rivaroxaban. Her symptoms began to improve gradually after initiating therapy.  Outcome and Follow-Up: She was discharged home after a week of hospitalization with instructions to continue anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months. After three-month follow-up  the patient was found symptom-free  and a repeat CT scan showed complete resolution of PE.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE in patients even with no significant past medical history. Clinicians should be aware that PE can occur in reportedly healthy individuals and timely diagnosis and intervention can prevent potentially fatal outcomes. Further studies are required to uncover unknown risk factors contributing to the occurrence of PE in adults.  Learning Points: - PE should be considered in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  or fatigue  irrespective of their past medical history. - PE can manifest in even functionally healthy individuals. - Timely initiation of anticoagulation therapy is crucial to improve survival rates in patients diagnosed with PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,96,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Female with Hypertension History  Case Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented in the Emergency Department reporting sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations which started two hours before admission. She lives in Phoenix  Arizona as a retired school teacher. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol infrequently in social settings. She lives alone  and she maintains an active lifestyle by walking daily and attending yoga classes.  Past Medical History:  Her medical records state that she has a history of hypertension  which had been well-controlled with amlodipine [5mg/day] for the past eight years. She underwent menopause at 51  after which she had received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years. She has no history of allergies. Her family history is remarkable for a brother who had a myocardial infarction and a mother who died of stroke  both in their mid-sixties.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  her BP was 145/85 mmHg  pulse rate was 108 bpm  respiratory rate was 22/m  and SpO2 was 92% on room air. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia  an incomplete right bundle-branch block suggesting subacute cor pulmonale. Laboratory values were notable for D-dimer  which was significantly elevated above the cut-off value (>5000 ng/mL). Other lab results including complete blood count  electrolytes  and troponin T levels were within normal ranges.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Due to her presenting symptoms and risk factors including age  hypertension  and previous HRT  a computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed leading to a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. The patient was started on heparin infusion as a standard initial treatment and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was started after 24 hours once the patient showed signs of clinical stabilization.  Outcome:  The patient tolerated the treatment well. Her symptoms improved significantly over the course of a few days. Her hypertension was combated with an increased dose of amlodipine (10 mg/day). On discharge  she was advised to continue rivaroxaban  regular monitoring of her BP  and was referred for follow-up appointments to evaluate her progress.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in older female patients presenting with unexplained chest pain and dyspnea  particularly if they have a history of HRT and hypertension. Timely diagnosis and intervention are crucial for positive outcomes in these patients.

The rest of the physical examination was normal.   Timeline: The patient reported that the symptoms started approximately 36 hours prior to her hospital visit and have since intensified.   Diagnostic Assessment: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia. In view of her symptoms and risk factors  a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was promptly performed  which confirmed a large saddle-type pulmonary embolus. Laboratory tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels  as well as mildly elevated troponin I levels.   Therapeutic Intervention: Immediate anticoagulation therapy was initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient was then started on oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban  a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)  which she is expected to continue for at least three months.  Follow-up and outcomes: Her symptoms improved significantly within 72 hours. Upon follow-up two weeks later  the patient reported feeling much better  with no repeated episode of chest pain or dyspnea. She was advised to continue her medication as directed and follow a healthy diet and regular exercise to reduce her BMI  as well as regular outpatient follow-ups.   Patient Perspective: The patient expresses relief for the prompt diagnosis and treatment she received. She holds a favorable outlook and is committed to taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle.   Informed consent: Informed consent was taken from the patient for this report.   Key Learning Points: This case illustrates that pulmonary embolism can occur even in fairly healthy individuals with minimal risk factors  making it vital for medical practitioners to always consider PE in the differential of unexplained dyspnea or chest pain. Prompt investigation  diagnosis  and treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. Furthermore  the patient's postmenopausal status and elevated BMI could be potential extrinsic risk factors for PE. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,7,100,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 54-Year-Old Female: A Case Report  Patient Demographic Information: The patient is a 54-year-old Caucasian female  living in a suburban area. She is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption and no known usage of illicit drugs. She has obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. The patient is a retired primary school teacher. She lives with her husband and two dogs  and has no children. The patient is not on any specific diet and does not exercise systematically. She has a family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) at her mother's side  who died at the age of 62 from a pulmonary embolism (PE).  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both being treated for the past ten years with metformin and telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide  respectively. She also has hypothyroidism  which she manages with levothyroxine. She has no known allergies or prior surgeries but she was hospitalized two years ago due to an episode of atrial fibrillation. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  and takes low-dose aspirin as a prophylactic measure.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe dyspnea  chest pain  and hemoptysis. She also mentioned that her heart was racing. Her family noted that her skin appeared paler than usual and she exhibited signs of restlessness.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient's blood pressure was 165/93 mmHg  pulse rate at 106 BPM  respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute  temperature of 98F  and Oxygen saturation on room air was 88%. There was a sign of engorged neck veins and peripheral edema on both legs. Heart sounds were normal. No rales or wheezes were noted in the lung auscultation.   Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation and known history of DVT  an acute PE was suspected. This was confirmed by a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest  which showed pulmonary artery blockage. D-dimer was highly elevated at 1500 ng/mL (<500 ng/mL is normal). The patient was subjected to ECG which showed sinuous tachycardia and right bundle branch block  a common sign of acute PE.   Management: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and immediately started on systemic intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. She was also given supplemental oxygen for improving oxygen saturation levels.  Patient Outcome: Post treatment  the patient reported a decrease in her chest pain and breathing improved with resolution in dyspnea. Two days post-admission  the respiratory rate was back to normal  blood pressure in the acceptable range and oxygen saturation was maintained at 98%.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering acute PE in patients presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and hemoptysis  especially those with risk factors like obesity  sedentary lifestyle  family history of VTE  and other comorbidities. Acute and appropriate medical intervention can lead to favorable patient outcomes.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,1,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Robert Gordon. He resides in a suburban area of Michigan  living with his wife. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has two grown-up children who live nearby with their families. Robert is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol.  Presenting Illness:  Robert was taken to the emergency department with severe difficulty in breathing and sharp chest pain. His symptoms started a few hours before he was admitted. His wife noticed his lips turning a bit blue  and he seemed to struggle dramatically to catch his breath. He expressed complaining about pain in his right side  rating it an 8 on the pain scale.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Gordon has a long history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was previously taken off anticoagulants because he developed gastrointestinal bleeding. He is also a known patient with hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had died due to heart failure at the age of 68  and his elder brother suffered a stroke at 70.  Clinical Findings:  The patient's BP on admission was 150/90 mmHg  pulse 100 bpm  respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute  SpO2 86% on room air  and fever of 38.1 degree Celsius. On examination  reduced breath sounds were noted predominantly in the right lower lung  and the right calf was swollen  warm  and tender. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm with no murmur. The rest of the systems were unremarkable.  Investigations:  The D-dimer came back as high 1.5 mcg/mL (normal range <0.5 mcg/mL). Subsequently  a CT pulmonary angiogram was performed  which confirmed the presence of an embolus in the right pulmonary artery. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block.   Diagnosis:  Based on these findings  the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism was made.  Treatment:  Mr. Gordon was immediately given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with supplemental oxygen. He responded well to the initial treatment  appearing less cyanosed with significant improvement in breathlessness. Also  the pain seemed to subside  rating it a 3 on the pain scale. He got admitted to the ICU where further management follows.  Discussion:  Risk factors for Mr. Gordon's presentation include advanced age  past history of DVT  hypertension  and the family history of cardiovascular disease. Stopping anticoagulants due to his previous gastrointestinal bleeding could have also contributed to the development of the pulmonary embolus. His COPD might have complicated his clinical presentation. Pulmonary embolisms are a medical emergency  often presenting with shortness of breath  chest pain  and signs of hypoxia  as was the case above  and immediate treatment is necessary to improve prognosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,2,Case Presentation:  Patient Identification: The patient is Mrs. GJ  an African American woman  73 years old. She lives with her daughter in Chicago  is a grandmother of five  and is now retired after working as a schoolteacher for over 40 years. She is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. She leads a sedentary lifestyle and is overweight.   Past Medical History: Mrs. GJ has a history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus along with occasional episodes of transient ischemic attacks. She has dyslipidemia  managed by statin therapy. Her BMI is estimated to be 32 and she recently had right knee arthroplasty three weeks ago. She reports adherence to her daily medications  which are comprised of Losartan  Metformin  and Simvastatin.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset and progressive shortness of breath along with non-radiating substernal chest pain. The breathlessness is especially severe on exertion and she has been experiencing episodes of dizziness.  Family History:   Her family history revealed that her father died of a heart attack at the age of 78; her sister is also a current patient of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Her mother suffered from a stroke and died at the age of 82.  Examination and Investigation Results: The physical examination showed that her vital signs were stable but her oxygen saturation level was hovering around 90%  even with supplemental oxygen. Auscultation and percussion of the lungs were normal. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. There were no clinical signs of DVT in her legs. She had a raised D-dimer level  suggestive of a possible clotting disorder.  A computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  showing a large clot in her left pulmonary artery.   Management and Prognosis:   The patient was admitted and started on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin to prevent clot propagation. She was also administered oxygen suppletion and pain management was ensured. PE severity and her risk factors were taken into account while deciding on the duration of her anticoagulant therapy.   Discussion: This case portrays an imagery of an elderly African-American woman with multiple risk factors for developing acute pulmonary embolism. The patient’s history of recent surgery  age  ethnicity  and sedentary lifestyle  combined with her comorbidities such as obesity  hypertension  and diabetes  increased her risk factor for acute PE. Early diagnosis and management of the PE in this patient possibly prevented further severe complications such as recurrent PE  pulmonary hypertension  or PE associated death. This case further emphasizes the importance of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high risk patients  especially those undergoing surgery.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,3,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Lewis is a 60-year-old African-American male who was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that began earlier in the day. The pain is sharp  constant and worsens on taking deep breaths. He also mentioned that he has been feeling lightheaded and slightly confused. He denies any cough  fever  or recent injuries.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Lewis has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and obesity with a BMI of 32. He is a former smoker with a smoking history of 25 years  but quit 10 years ago. He maintains a fairly sedentary lifestyle and has been on a steady regimen of metformin  lisinopril and atorvastatin. Mr. Lewis recently underwent a total knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago and was discharged with low-molecular-weight heparin for prophylaxis against thromboembolism  but admitted he stopped taking it after one week because he did not think it was needed anymore.  Family History:  His mother had a stroke in her early 70s and his paternal grandfather died of a heart attack when he was in his 60s. His father has type 2 diabetes and his elder sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late 40s.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  his blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg  pulse rate is 110 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation on room air is 92%. He appears anxious and is in visible distress. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia with no distinct murmurs  rubs  or gallops. His recent surgical wound appears to be healing well without signs of infection.  Investigations & Diagnosis:  Blood tests reveal elevated D-dimer level. An electrocardiogram (EKG) suggests right heart strain with T wave inversion in leads V1-V3. His chest X-ray is relatively normal. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed revealing multiple filling defects consistent with pulmonary emboli in both lungs. Hence  he was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  This case underscores the importance of compliance with post-operative medications  especially in patients with risk factors for thromboembolic events such as surgery  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  black ethnicity  and history of smoking. It also highlights how symptoms and risk factors guide towards an appropriate diagnosis. His management plan revolved around anticoagulation therapy and patient education about his condition  adherence to medication  and lifestyle modifications.   References:  1.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,4,Patient Information:  A 67-year-old African-American female from New York City presents with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient lives alone and works as an office administrator. She is a non-smoker and reports no significant consumption of alcohol or use of illicit drugs.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about 7 years ago  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which she is currently taking Metformin and Lisinopril.  Family History:   Her mother had hypertension and her father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. Moreover  she had an older brother who died of a stroke two years earlier.  Clinical findings:  The clinical findings were crucial in making the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Her blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  pulse was 105 beats/minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute  and her oxygen saturation was 90% on room air.   On examining the cardiovascular system  normal heart sounds were heard with a tachycardia. Her respiratory examination was significant for decreased breath sounds in the lower lung field and crackles on the left side. Her obesity made the peripheral vascular examination difficult  but no visible signs of deep venous thrombosis were noted. Her ECG showed nonspecific ST changes but no other abnormalities.  Hospital Course:  The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism based on a high clinical suspicion and was immediately initiated on anticoagulation therapy. She was admitted and intravenous Heparin was started  with the dose adjusted according to her weight. She reported significant improvement in her symptoms over the next two days. A further plan of action for long term oral anticoagulation was considered after initial stabilization.  Discussion:  This case identifies the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with breathlessness and chest pains  especially those with a previous history of DVT. There is also a need for further studies to find more accurate diagnostic models in the African American population  as literature suggests that PE often presents with less typical symptoms and is therefore underdiagnosed in this group.  Patient Education:  The patient was educated about the importance of medication adherence  regular follow-up visits and monitoring  signs of bleeding  and the need for a healthy lifestyle to manage her diabetes and hypertension effectively.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of considering high risk factors when evaluating a patient’s disease state for a prompt diagnosis and comprehensive management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,5,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 43-year-old African American male with a height of 6'2"""" and weight 120 kg presenting to the emergency department. His chief concerns include sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain lasting three hours. He also notes generalized malaise  fatigue  and mild fever. No syncopal episodes were noted. Acute Pulmonary Embolism was suspected based on signs and symptoms.  Past Medical History: The patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years prior  alongside obesity and hypertension. The DVT was managed without significant recurrence until now. He was compliant with antihypertensive medication but no anticoagulants  ignoring lifestyle modifications suggested for obesity.  Demographics: As a middle-aged African American male  he is a community college lecturer with a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. He is married  with one child  and is a non-smoker.  Family History: His father was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at the age of 49  and his mother suffers from type-II diabetes. One of his maternal uncles had a stroke at a young age.  Investigations and Findings: His vital signs reveal that his blood pressure is elevated at 160/95mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  temperature of 37.8 ºC and his oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. An ECG shows a sinus tachycardia  ST-segment depression in V1-V4. Chest X-ray is within normal limits. His D-Dimer levels are significantly raised.  Diagnosis:  Based on his symtoms  previous medical history  blood tests  and ECG  acute pulmonary embolism was diagnosed. The elevated D-Dimer levels and history of DVT mainly supported the diagnosis. Further confirmatory tests followed suit.  Discussion: The patient's risk factors contributing to the acute pulmonary embolism include a history of DVT  obesity  and prolonged immobility due to his sedentary lifestyle. The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism should be promptly and effectively controlled to prevent long-term damage  especially in uncontrolled hypertension patients  who already have an increased cardiovascular risk.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,6,Patient Demographics:  55-year-old African-American male.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient complained of sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain.  Past Medical History:  The patient was previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. There’s a history of two previous instances of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) over the past five years.  Allergies:  No known drug allergies.  Medication History:  The patient is on Metformin 500mg BD for his Diabetes and Losartan 50mg OD for Hypertension. He had been on Warfarin therapy for the previous DVT instances but discontinued the treatment six months ago without discussing it with a physician.  Lifestyle:  The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He leads a sedentary lifestyle with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.1 indicating obesity.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father dying from a Myocardial Infarction at 62 and his elder brother having undergone angioplasty at the age of 50. The patient's mother also had Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  patient was conscious  but visibly anxious and appeared to be in respiratory distress. The Oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. His Blood Pressure was 140/90mmHg  Pulse rate was tachycardic at 110bpm  and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. On Auscultation of his chest  few crepitations were heard. The rest of the physical examination was essentially normal.  Diagnostic tests:  His Hemogram was normal and D-dimer levels were significantly raised. Electrocardiogram showed S1Q3T3 pattern. The Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the left pulmonary artery. The patient was immediately started on Oxygen via nasal prongs and Intravenous heparin.  Conclusion:  Given the patient’s previous history of DVT  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  diabetes and significant family history of cardiovascular disease  he falls into a high-risk category for Pulmonary Embolism (PE). His decision to stop warfarin might have triggered this acute episode of PE. This case underscores the importance of adhering to prescribed anticoagulant therapy for patients with recurrent episodes of DVT. The patient will be referred for lifestyle intervention  to manage obesity and improve his overall prognosis.   Note:  While developing this case study  relevant demographic representation has been carefully taken into account. African-Americans present higher rates of PE  as do men compared to women. Furthermore  people in their mid-fifties are at a considerably higher risk  especially those with factors such as hypertension  obesity  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,7,Patient Profile:   A 60-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The presenting symptoms started earlier that day and progressively worsened  with minor relief following rest and deep breathing.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of hypertension and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has been non-compliant with his anticoagulant therapy (Warfarin) for DVT since the last two months due to its side effects and financial constraints. Additionally  he is a former smoker with a 20-pack year history  having quit smoking five years ago. He has no known allergies.  Family History:  He has a family history of cardiac diseases. His father passed away at the age of 67 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother  aged 82  is currently receiving treatment for congestive heart failure. His elder sibling also takes beta-blockers for hypertension.  Physical Examination:   Upon examination  the patient was anxious and appeared to be in obvious respiratory distress: sweating  with increased respiratory rate (22 breaths per minute)  heart rate (110 beats per minute)  and blood pressure (155/90 mmHg). Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed reduced breath sounds in the right lung base.  Investigative findings:  Given his symptoms and history  an immediate ECG was performed  which revealed a sinus tachycardia without any evidence of ischemic changes. A CT Pulmonary Angiogram confirmed the presence of an acute pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery.  Management Plan:  The patient was admitted for immediate treatment. He was given oxygen supplementation and initiated on IV heparin drip. He was also restarted on oral anticoagulation therapy using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) instead of Warfarin  considering his history of non-compliance. Further  the patient was counseled regarding the significance of medication adherence. He was also referred to a social worker to explore financial assistance options for his medications.  Summary:  The case demonstrates how non-compliance to medication can potentially lead to severe health risks in patients with a history of DVT  emphasizing the importance of regular follow-up and adequate patient education. It showcases the need for a comprehensive approach in managing patients with chronic conditions  where addressing practical barriers to compliance may play a pivotal role in preventing critical events like pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,8,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 72-Year-Old Caucasian Female   I. Patient Identifying Information The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female arriving at the emergency department complaining of sudden shortness of breath and severe chest pain.   II. Reason for Current Admission Sudden onset of dyspnea and sharp  stabbing chest pain predominantly on the left side provoked by deep breathing. The patient also reports mild hemoptysis.  III. Past Medical History The patient is known to have hypertension  hypothyroidism and was previously diagnosed with stage IIb (T2N1M0) breast cancer which was successfully treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy 5 years prior. Her medications include Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. She stopped taking Tamoxifen 2 years ago after completing a 3-year regimen.  IV. Family History Her mother died of myocardial infarction at age 63. Her father had a stroke at 76 but lived until 87. Her younger sister is a breast cancer survivor  diagnosed at age 64  indicating a potential genetic risk for malignancy in this family.  V. Social History The patient is a widower and lives alone. She was a school teacher who retired 10 years ago. She quit smoking at 65  having smoked 1 pack per day since 20. She doesn't drink alcohol and has no known drug allergies.  VI. Clinical Findings On examination  the patient appeared distressed with RR 28/min  SpO2 89% on air  and BP 150/90 mmHg. Heart rate is tachycardic at 110 beats per minute. She had diminished breath sounds on auscultation biased on the left side and her left lower limb was slightly swollen with mild tenderness on deep palpation.  VII. Diagnostics An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and a S1Q3T3 pattern  suggestive of pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer test reported elevated levels. An urgent CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis with evidence of a saddle embolus obstructing the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery.  VIII. Plan The patient was immediately started on Low Molecular Weight Heparin for initial anticoagulation therapy and then bridged to oral anticoagulant (Warfarin). Thrombolytic therapy was not considered due to risk of bleeding since she is older. The patient will continue anticoagulation therapy over the next 6 months – 1 year. Monthly follow ups will be necessary to ensure optimal control.  This case presentation has highlighted the need for acute intervention when pulmonary embolism is suspected in cancer survivors to prevent severe complications and possible mortality.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,9,Patient Presentation  Ms. L is a 65-year-old African-American woman who came to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient reported feeling a sudden  sharp  and severe pain in her chest  she also mentioned that the pain intensifies when she takes a deep breath or coughs. She has a past medical history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been a smoker for the last 40 years and is currently on medication to manage COPD and hypertension.  She was living by herself and was coping well until today. Her mother had died at the age of 72 due to complications related to hypertension and one of her brothers had died at the age of 58 of a heart attack.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostics  On physical examination  she appeared anxious and was in obvious respiratory distress. Her heart rate was increased (tachycardia) and she had a low-grade fever. Her blood pressure was noted to be elevated  which is unusual for pulmonary embolism patients but was attributed to her history of hypertension.   A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed  which showed a large embolus in the right main and left pulmonary arteries. A D-dimer test was done which was notably high - a common result in patients with acute pulmonary emboli. Her electrocardiogram showed right heart strain  suggesting involvement of the right ventricle.  Management and Outcomes  Ms. L was immediately administered oxygen therapy and anticoagulation to dissolve the clot and prevent more clots from forming. Given her significant COPD history and extensive clot burden  a decision was made to admit her to the hospital's intensive care unit for close monitoring and management.   In terms of outcomes  patients with acute pulmonary embolism have a variable prognosis depending on various factors. Immediate intervention with anticoagulant therapy generally expected to have favorable outcomes in the case of our patient presentation.  Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in any patient presenting with sudden breathlessness and chest pain. The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism requires a high degree of suspicion  prompt diagnosis  and early management to prevent potentially fatal consequences. The presence of significant comorbidities  such as COPD in this patient  adds an additional layer of complexity to management. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,10,Patient Presentation  We have a 65-year-old African American female named Mrs. J.H who is admitted to the emergency department with severe chest pain and sudden onset of shortness of breath that started about six hours ago. She reports feeling dizzy and experiencing an accelerated heart rate. Her SpO2 on room air is 85%  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/85  respiratory rate of 22 per minute  and a fever of 100.6 F.   Past Medical History  Mrs. J.H is a known hypertensive and diabetic patient for the past ten years under medication. She had a total hysterectomy for uterine fibroids three weeks ago. Mrs. J.H smokes a pack of cigarettes per day for over 20 years  and despite multiple attempts  she has been unable to quit. She reports having no known drug allergies.  Family History  Mrs. J.H's mother died of a stroke in her early 70s  and her paternal grandfather died of a heart attack. Her father has hypertension  and her younger brother has type 2 diabetes. There is no family history of pulmonary embolism.  Physical Examination and Testing  Mrs. J.H presented anxiety  diaphoresis and pallor  and experience of acute chest pain described as a sharp  stabbing pain  particularly with deep breaths. She has clear bilateral breath sounds  tachycardia with a regular rhythm  and no leg swelling or redness.   A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram confirmed a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with the presence of large filling defects in the left and right main pulmonary arteries. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia. Blood works showed raised D-dimer levels. Her chest X-ray was normal.  Management Plan  Doctors initiated immediate thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Mrs. J.H was also given anticoagulation medicine for secondary prevention and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Her regular medication also continues. The patient reported a gradual feeling of relief after three hours of treatment  with a marked improvement in oxygen saturation and normalization of heart rate. Health professionals have recommended cessation of tobacco use and maintaining an optimal level of physical activity as part of her lifestyle changes in addition to the regular medical regimen.  Future Appointments  A follow-up appointment has been organized to evaluate her response to treatment and monitor her ongoing regimens for diabetes and hypertension. It’s essential for Mrs. J.H to know her risk factors for future episodes of pulmonary embolism  and address potential preventative measures  such as weight loss  smoking cessation  and increased physical activity.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,11,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with the chief complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. The pain has been continuous and does not alleviate with rest. He rates his pain as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. He denies any dizziness or fainting spells.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with these conditions 15 years ago and has been managing them with medication (Metformin for diabetes and Losartan for hypertension) and diet. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago following a knee replacement surgery. Patient denies any history of lung disease or asthma.  Social History:   The patient lives with his wife and retired 3 years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 25 years. He drinks socially and denies any illicit drug use. He is not physically active and admits to a diet high in fats and carbohydrates.  Family History:   There is a history of cardiovascular disease in his family; his father died at the age of 60 from a stroke  and his mother suffered from chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertension.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was elevated at 155/90 mmHg  pulse rapid at 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation at 90% on room air. Auscultation of lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases and scattered wheezes.   Diagnostic Tests: An urgent D-dimer test showed elevated levels. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern  which is often associated with acute pulmonary embolism. A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Management and Prognosis: He was subsequently admitted to ICU for further monitoring and treatment. He was placed on intravenous heparin for immediate anticoagulation and started on oral warfarin therapy. The interdisciplinary team initiated health education regarding the importance of medication adherence  maintaining a healthy diet  and increasing physical activity.  Ongoing management will involve close monitoring of the patient's INR levels and adjustment of the warfarin dosage as necessary. Long-term prognosis is highly dependent on adherence to anticoagulation therapy and lifestyle modifications to manage risk factors. In light of his family history and personal history of DVT  genetics consultation might be of value to rule out hereditary thrombophilia.   Future interventions may include the use of compression stockings to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome and lifestyle modification to lose weight and address sedentary behavior. An extensive discussion with the patient and family regarding the benefits and potential risks of anticoagulation therapy is also warranted. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,12,Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe  a 64-year-old African American male  has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. He's self-employed as a carpenter and resides in Newark  New Jersey along with his wife.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe came into the ER complaining of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and dizziness. The patient expressed that his symptoms have been worsening over the past two days.   Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on Amlodipine and Atorvastatin for the past 15 years. He is generally in good health and has annual check-ups resulting in normal findings. He was a smoker for about 20 years  from the age of 25 to 45  and he quit cigarette smoking 19 years ago.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at 67 years while his mother died of cerebrovascular accident at 71 years. He has one brother who was diagnosed with venous thrombosis in his early 50s.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  Mr. Doe was tachycardic with heart rate of 108 beats per minute  and had mild hypertension (BP 158/92 mm Hg). His oxygen saturation was noted to be 92% on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal prong. Auscultation revealed bilateral faint crackles at the bases.  Relevant Investigations:  A D-dimer test was done given the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism which came out to be positive. The subsequent CT pulmonary angiography showed filling defects in the left pulmonary artery indicative of acute PE.  Diagnosis:  Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Treatment Plan:  He was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Consultation with hematology was made for consideration of thrombolysis due to worsening respiratory distress.   Discussion:  Mr. Doe is a patient with several risk factors for PE  including his older age  hypertension  and history of smoking. Acute pulmonary embolism is a significant disease with heavy morbidity and mortality. It seldom presents with classic symptoms  hence a high index of suspicion is key for early diagnosis and treatment. The risk of Pulmonary embolism in African American is reportedly around 25-30 cases per 100 000 population  and it increases with age  as found in literature.  This case underlines the importance of timely recognition and management of acute PE  especially in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors. Smoking cessation and better hypertension control are key modifiable risk factors in this case.   Prognosis:  The prognosis in this case highly depends on the overall health status of Mr. Doe  the severity of the embolism and his response to the treatment. Early detection and management reportedly results in better survival rates. Patient education and post-discharge care are essential parts of this recovery process.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,13,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American woman  a retired nurse from Houston  Texas  who has been dealing with overweight issues  and was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of sudden-onset shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that increases with deep breathing. She also reports mild dizziness and a feeling of generalized weakness.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed with medication. She quit smoking 10 years ago but had smoked a pack per day for 25 years. Additionally  she leads a sedentary lifestyle due to her arthritis pain. She recently underwent a total hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago  which was notable for prolonged immobility.  Family History:  Her mother died at age 72 from myocardial infarction  her father died of stroke at age 78. She has one sister diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65. There is no known history of blood clots in the family.  Review of Systems:  Apart from the primary respiratory complaint  the patient reported no other issues. She denied any history of cough  hemoptysis  or fever. No noted changes in bowel or urinary habits. She denies nausea  vomiting  changes in appetite or weight loss.  Physical Examination:  On examination  patient was conscious but appeared anxious and pale. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 155/95 mmHg; heart rate 112 bpm; respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute; body temperature 37 Celsius; oxygen saturation 89% on room air.  Investigations:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without acute ischemic changes. CT angiography confirmed the presence of a large embolus in both pulmonary arteries. D-dimers were significantly elevated (>5000 ng/mL).  Conclusion:  Acute pulmonary embolism was diagnosed based on the history  physical examination findings  and investigations. The case represents a classical presentation of an embolic event  which is commonly seen in patients with prolonged immobility due to surgery or other reasons especially with a background of long-term disease conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. With a history of smoking  hypertensive and diabetic history  her risk for developing cardiovascular complications is significantly high. Immediate anticoagulation therapy was initiated.  Notes:  This case has updated information and closely portrays the demographic representation of pulmonary embolism seen worldwide. African American females specifically have been seen to have a slightly higher risk of developing pulmonary embolism  with risk factors including obesity  hypertension  and diabetes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,14,Patient Profile: Mr. Jones is a 62-year-old African American retired navy officer  currently residing in Washington  D.C. He has been married for 38 years and has three grown-up children. His lifestyle is fairly sedentary  with an inclination towards a diet high in processed and fatty foods.   Past Medical History: His past medical history is significant for hypertension managed with Lisinopril  type II diabetes mellitus controlled with Metformin  hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin  and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago. Taking into consideration his medical history  Mr. Jones is obese (BMI of 32). He has been a former smoker for the last 20 years.   Family History: He has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both parents dying from heart disease. His mother had DVT and his father had experienced a pulmonary embolism.   Presenting Concern: Mr. Jones visited the hospital because of increasing episodes of breathlessness and an ongoing dull chest pain that increased in intensity over the past week. A sharp pain was reported on deep inspiration. Furthermore  he also suffered from recent unexplained weight loss and nighttime sweats.   Diagnosis: He was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. The condition was confirmed through chest imaging and D-dimer levels  which were significantly increased. CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated several filling defects in the pulmonary arterial tree consistent with pulmonary embolism. A duplex scan of the lower extremities showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis.   Management Plan: Mr. Jones is now on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin  planned to transition to Warfarin  together with diabetic and hypertensive regimen adjustments. Lifestyle modifications  including diet and physical therapy  have been suggested to Mr. Jones.   He will be scheduled for regular follow-up consultations with his cardiologist and diabetologist. His family was also educated about his condition  the importance of medication adherence  and the potential signs of complications  such as sudden worsening breathlessness or chest pain.   Given this case's features  it was concluded that Mr. Jones's acute pulmonary embolism likely resulted from untreated DVT  and that his subsequent obesity  hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle might have contributed to his current medical condition. His family history also suggested a potential genetic predisposition towards hematological abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases.   In conclusion  this case emphasizes the importance of considering a patient's full medical history  lifestyle  and family history in diagnosing and managing pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,15,Subject: Mrs. Martinez  52-year-old Hispanic Female with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Case Presentation:  The patient under review is Mrs. Martinez  a 52-year-old Hispanic female who presents with acute symptoms of shortness of breath  fast heart rate and chest pain  suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. The symptoms commenced suddenly about a few hours prior to presentation. She is a nonsmoker and lives with her husband and two adult children in an urban setting. She does not have any known drug allergies.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Martinez has a known history of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which she has been administered metformin. In addition  she has been previously diagnosed with hypertension  which is controlled with the administration of Lisinopril. On her last health review  her blood pressure was reported as 130/84 mmHg  and her glycemic indices were within target range. Mrs. Martinez also experiences varicose veins  but no corrective surgery has been done to remedy this.  Family History:  There is a notable family history of cardiovascular disease; her mother had died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and her paternal uncle was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis.  Current Presentation:  Upon current admission  Mrs. Martinez's vitals were stable but her oxygen saturation was lower than the normal  reading at 90% on room air. A D-dimer test came back positive  and a subsequent CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. Echocardiogram showed right ventricular strain  which dictates that the condition is severe.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Considering Mrs. Martinez's clinical situation and risk factors associated with her demographic representation  she was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy. The chosen regimen was parenteral anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin bridged with warfarin.   Discussion:  The high incidence of pulmonary embolism in Mrs. Martinez's age group is well-documented in literature. Additionally  factors such as her Hispanic ethnicity  obesity  history of diabetes and hypertension increased the risk. The familial history of cardiovascular disease has also contributed significantly to her predisposition to develop venous thrombus. Varicose veins also pose as a potential risk factor.   Outcome and Follow-up:  Mrs. Martinez responded well to the prompt therapeutic measures and showed signs of improvement. Before discharge  patient education was ensured about the importance of medication adherence  lifestyle modifications to assist weight loss  glycemic control  hypertension management  and the signs and symptoms of recurrent PE for future reference. Follow-ups were scheduled for monitoring the INR and further cardiovascular assessment. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,16,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J  a 62-year-old African-American male  has presented with an acute onset of increasing shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  cough  and light-headedness for the past two days. He describes the pain as sharp and worsening with deep breaths. Mr. J is a retired construction worker and has a 20-pack-year smoking history. He lives with his wife and has three adult children.  Past Medical History:   Mr. J has a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes  both of which are currently well-controlled with medication. Last year  he underwent a total knee replacement surgery on his left knee. He was found to have a deep vein thrombosis post-operatively  for which he was given a course of anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban for three months. Following that period  anticoagulation was stopped. He reports having adhered to the prescribed physical therapy regimen post-surgery. Mr. J has been on Metformin 500mg BID for type 2 diabetes and Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension.  Family History:  His family history is notable for a mother with type 2 diabetes and a father with coronary artery disease who died of a myocardial infarction at age 70. He has a younger sister who experienced a deep vein thrombosis in her 50s.   Social History:  He admits to a history of smoking (20 pack-years) but denies any drug or heavy alcohol use. He reports that he’s been attempting to quit smoking  however  the process has been challenging.  Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and in moderate respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  BP of 134/90 mmHg  and heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1/S2 with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Based on clinical suspicion and his presentation  an initial D-dimer test was carried out  which came back positively elevated  thus raising suspicion of a thromboembolic condition. A CT pulmonary angiogram was carried out and confirmed acute pulmonary embolism. He was immediately started on inpatient therapeutic anticoagulation. Additionally  it was identified that Mr. J would need genetic testing and counseling based on the recurrence of a thromboembolic event and family history of unprovoked VTE.   This case represents a classical presentation of an acute pulmonary embolism  reiterating the significant risk of developing thromboembolic conditions in patients with history of prior venous thromboembolism and the crucial role of genetic predisposition. It emphasizes the importance of clinical suspicion  rapid diagnosis and management in acute pulmonary embolism to prevent fatal outcomes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,17,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 58-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain  which he rated as 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. He reported that the symptoms began approximately three hours before arrival. He said that his chest pain aggravated at deep breathing and felt slightly improved after staying still.  Patient's Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity two years prior  which was managed with anticoagulants. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he was compliant with his prescribed medications. He had undergone an elective knee surgery six months prior. He is a smoker having a 35-pack-year history but denies any drug or alcohol use.  The Family History:  The patient's family history revealed that his father died of a massive stroke and his mother had breast cancer. One of his older brothers had a pulmonary embolism and died at an early age due to undiagnosed coagulation dysfunction. He has two other siblings who are generally healthy.  Diagnostic Findings:   Upon examination  Mr. J had a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His physical exam was notable for decreased breath sounds on the right lower lung field. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no other significant changes. D-dimer levels were elevated.  Considering his symptoms  history of DVT and high risk for PE  a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was conducted which confirmed the presence of a large pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of his lung.  Summary:  In summary  Mr. J  a 58-year-old African American male with a significant history of DVT  presented with symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism which was confirmed through CTPA. He is at high risk due to his past history of DVT  recent surgery  tobacco usage  and family history of pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,18,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male  single  and a retired high-school teacher  who reports dyspnea  chest pain and slight dizziness which initiated two days ago. He is a long-term resident of a urban community in Chicago. He has never smoked in his life and drinks on occasions  of approximately 2 to 3 drinks per month.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of obesity  hypertension  and a sedentary lifestyle. Other co-morbidities include type-2 diabetes  for which he takes Metformin. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  treated with Rivaroxaban at that time. He has not undergone recent surgery.  Family History:  His mother died at the age of 70 due to cardiac failure  and his father died at the age of 76 due to stroke. He has a sister who was diagnosed with DVT a few years back.  Current Episode:  The patient came into the emergency department with the chief complaint of difficulty in breathing and chest pain. Upon physical examination  the medical team identified tachypnea  mild hypoxia  and elevated blood pressure. High D-dimer levels were detected upon laboratory testing. The preliminary chest computer tomography (CT) scan indicated a large embolism in the left pulmonary artery.  Diagnosis:  Following the results from laboratory testing and the CT scan  a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made. It was identified that this was likely secondary to his history of DVT and prolonged periods of immobility.  Treatment Planning:  The patient was immediately started on systemic anticoagulation with intravenous Heparin. The thrombus size and the patient's stable condition did not necessitate thrombolytic therapy  and the patient was not at high risk of bleeding. For long-term management  the plan is to switch the patient to oral anticoagulation therapy.  Plan for Follow-up:  Educating the patient on lifestyle modifications like inclusion of regular physical activities  and instructions for the adherence to prescribed medicines were stressed. Regular follow-ups for monitoring his INR levels  response to treatment  and potential side effects from the anticoagulation medication were planned as well.  Summary:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing and promptly treating acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with high-risk factors like obesity  sedentary lifestyle  prior history of DVT  and familial predisposition. Public health measures can also play a significant role in preventing such cases through targeted initiatives and promotions of healthy lifestyle changes.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,20,Patient Profile  The patient is Mr. Brown  a 65-year-old African-American male  residing in Detroit  Michigan. He is a retiree from a blue-collar job  married  and has three grown-up children. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks socially.  Past Medical History  Mr. Brown has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has been on oral hypoglycemic (Metformin) and antihypertensive (Lisinopril) for the last ten years. He had a right hip replacement surgery two years ago due to osteoarthritis  but his postoperative period was uneventful.   Presenting Complaints  Mr. Brown presented in the emergency department with severe chest pain  tachycardia  coughing  and shortness of breath. His symptoms started suddenly and have progressively worsened over several hours.   Family History  Mr. Brown's father died of a myocardial infarction at age 70  and his mother died at age 80 from a stroke. His sister  who is currently in her late 60s  has a history of deep vein thrombosis. There is no history of hematological disorders or malignancies in his family.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis  On arrival  the vital signs were unstable with a heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right lower lung field. Due to his presentation and family history  doctors suspected a cardio-pulmonary condition. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed  revealing a large embolism in the right pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Management  Mr. Brown was immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Due to the unstable vitals  thrombolysis was considered.  Discussion  In this case  we suspect that the PE is secondary to a DVT considering his family history  sedentary lifestyle  and previous hip replacement surgery. This case also highlights the importance of considering PE in any patient with a sudden onset of breathlessness  chest pain  or both  particularly in those with a risk factor for PE.   In terms of demographics  PE has an annual incidence rate of about 1 per 1 000 people in the general population in the U.S  and it tends to increase significantly with age. Some studies have also found increased rates of PE among African-Americans compared to other races and ethnicities.  Reference: Wells PS  Anderson DR  Rodger M  et al.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,21,Patient Profile Patient Name: [Anonymous]  Age: 55 years  Sex: Gender  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Office worker   Chief Complaint: Unexplained shortness of breath coupled with severe chest pain  Presenting illness: Initially  the patient presented with generalized unease progressing to acute shortness of breath and extreme chest discomfort over the last 48 hours. The chest pain  described as a deep stinging sensation  became progressively sharper and more confined to the lateral side of the chest  towards the lower ribs.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which they have been taking medication for the past 10 years. They were also diagnosed with Type II diabetes 7 years ago  continuing to manage it through dietary control  oral hypoglycemic drugs  and regular exercise. Moreover  the patient had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episode eight years ago after undergoing hip replacement surgery  a known risk factor for pulmonary embolism. The patient previously used to smoke but quit ten years before the current presentation.   Family History: The patient's father suffered a stroke in his early sixties and the mother has a history of hypertension. No known genetic disorders in the family.   Test and Results: Blood tests showed elevated levels of D-dimer  a substance that's often released when a blood clot dissolves. Electrocardiography showed S1Q3T3 pattern suggesting acute cor pulmonale due to acute pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed a large clot blocking the patient's left pulmonary artery.  Treatment: Subsequent to diagnosis  immediate anticoagulant therapy was initiated with intravenous heparin  a non-fractional type. Once the patient was stabilized  longer-term treatment with warfarin was introduced.   Discussion: The patient’s age  sedentary office work lifestyle  personal history of DVT  and past smoking habit possibly heightened their risk of occurrence for a pulmonary embolism. The acute pulmonary symptoms exhibited were not initially indicative of the embolism. However  the patient’s past medical history encompassing a previous DVT episode was determinant in diagnosing and treating this condition. With the administration of appropriate anticoagulant treatment  the prognosis is cautious but positive.   Conclusion: The patient's history of DVT and lifestyle are significant factors for developing a pulmonary embolism. Regular follow-ups and strict compliance with anticoagulant regimens are absolutely necessary for this patient to minimize the risk of recurrent embolism.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,23,Patient Profile: Mr. Allen  a 58-year-old African American male  a retired high school teacher  presented to the emergency department (Emergency Department Visit  2/1/22) complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. He lives in a small suburban community with his wife  has two grown-up children and three grandchildren.   Past medical history: Mr. Allen has a previous medical record of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  being on medication (Lisinopril and Metformin  respectively) for the past seven years. He quit smoking fifteen years ago but has a significant 30 pack-year history prior to quitting. He also has a recorded BMI of 29  indicating obesity.   Family history:  Relevant family history includes his father dying at age 61 due to a myocardial infarction  and his older brother undergoing treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at age 55.  Presenting complaints and physical examination: At the time of presentation  Mr. Allen was anxious and dyspneic with saturated oxygen levels dropping to 88% on room air. He denied any recent long trips or immobilization and doesn't take any hormonal therapies. The physical examination showed tachycardia and mild hypotension; lung auscultation revealed slight wheezing but no crackles.  Investigations:  An elevated level of D-dimer was noted in his blood tests. A CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery leading to the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. His ECG displayed a sinus tachycardia and right bundle branch block.   Management: Mr. Allen was treated straight away with supplemental oxygen and intravenous unfractionated heparin. Based on the severity of symptoms and imaging findings  Thrombolytic therapy was also considered.  Discussion: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a relatively common vascular disease with potentially life-threatening complications in the short term. The literature shows a higher prevalence of PE among African American patients compared to other demographics  and a higher mortality rate among men. The risk of PE increases with age  obesity  prolonged immobilization  surgery  malignancy  pregnancy  oral contraceptive use  and existing comorbidity such as heart disease or stroke. In Mr. Allen's case  his age  race  past medical history of hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and family history of heart disease and DVT are significant risk factors.  This case highlights the importance of considering PE in patients with unexplained dyspnea  particularly in those with relevant risk factors. Early detection and prompt treatment can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,24,Patient Presentation:  Demographics: The patient is a 52-year-old African American woman who works as a receptionist. She is a nonsmoker but has a BMI of 28  indicating she is overweight.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and a sharp stabbing chest pain that worsened upon taking deep breaths. She also mentioned feeling lightheaded.  Past Medical History: Her past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are all managed with medication. There is no history of surgeries or hospitalizations.   Pharmacological History: She is on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Family History: The patient's mother has a history of stroke in her sixties and her father passed away from a heart attack in his late fifties. She also mentioned a sister with a history of deep vein thrombosis post-pregnancy.  Examination: On examination  her heart rate was 110/min  blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 22/min and O2 saturation was 89%. On auscultation  breath sounds were decreased on the right side.   Investigations: With the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE)  a D-dimer test was ordered  which returned positive. Then  a CT pulmonary angiography was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE.  Discussion: Our patient belongs to one of the highest risk groups for pulmonary embolism  middle-aged African American women. African Americans have a higher incidence rate for PE (incidence rates of 112 vs 82 per 100 000 population). Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension and frequent travel due to her job are also risk factors. Her family history of thrombotic events further increases her pre-disposition to PE.   Management: She was admitted to the hospital and initiated on anticoagulant therapy with heparin followed by oral warfarin. She was also counseled on lifestyle modification strategies for managing obesity and diabetes  which would also reduce her risk of recurrent PE.  Plan: The plan is to monitor her in the hospital until her condition stabilizes. Upon discharge  she will continue on warfarin therapy  with regular follow-ups to monitor INR levels and adjust the warfarin dosage as needed. She should follow a diet supportive of her conditions  increasing physical activity as tolerated and gradually lose weight.  Educational Objectives: This case highlights the importance of recognizing risk factors for PE in patients presenting with dyspnea. It also emphasizes the importance of early anticoagulation in acute PE management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,25,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a 54-year old African American male  residing in Detroit  Michigan. He is divorced with two children. The patient is a retired man who had served in the military. He has a history of smoking – a pack a day starting at age 19  quitting at age 45. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 30.2  indicating that he falls under the category of obese. The patient's family history has shown his mother died of a stroke at the age of 68 and his father died of lung cancer at age 71.  Past Medical History: The patient has suffered from high blood pressure. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which he underwent treatment two years ago.  The patient also has diabetes Mellitus type 2  controlled with Metformin. The capsule has been well tolerated. Cardiograms taken a year ago showed normal results.  Presenting Symptoms: He was admitted to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  severe cough with a little amount of hemoptysis  chest pain  especially when he breathes in. He also reported feelings of light-headedness and increased instances of sweating.  Diagnosis: Based on the presenting symptoms and medical history  a preliminary diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) was made. This was confirmed with a CT pulmonary angiography  which showed a conspicuous filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery.  Treatment& Follow-up He received treatment in the form of anticoagulant therapy initiated immediately upon suspicion and continued after confirmation of diagnosis. This consisted of LMWH (Enoxaparin) administered subcutaneously. He was also provided supplemental oxygen to combat the hypoxia. The patient experienced significant relief of symptoms with administered treatment.   Follow-up appointment was arranged one week later with the hospital to monitor symptoms and adjust dosage of anticoagulants if necessary. It was suggested that the patient must undergo lifestyle changes to manage his weight and control his diabetes better— working with a nutritionist  regular exercise. A psychiatric assessment was also recommended to evaluate and manage possible Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since he was in the military.  The patient is recommended for re-evaluation after one month to reassess treatment. He was suggested to look for signs of excess bleeding  a potential side effect of anticoagulation treatment  and seek immediate medical help if they occur. He was  in addition  educated about the benefits of smoking cessation  even though he quit  the damage it has already done could still cause future health problems.   This case of acute PE showcases that patients' past medical history  lifestyle behaviours and family history can significantly impact the development and management of the disease. A patient-centered approach  taking into account psychological state  lifestyle habits  and the underlying disease had a significant contribution to the management of this patient.   References: 1.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,26,Patient Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  INTRODUCTION  The patient is a 67-year-old male of African American descent  presenting with symptoms of sudden onset breathlessness and chest pain. Based on the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR) system  the patient lives in a suburban  middle-class neighborhood in Ohio.  PRESENTING CONCERN AND HISTORY OF PRESENTING CONCERN  The patient arrived at the emergency department suffering from sharp  pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath that started three hours prior. He also mentioned a feeling of light-headedness but denied experiencing hemoptysis  palpitations  or any lower limb pain/swelling.  CLINICAL HISTORY  The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled successfully with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide)  and was diagnosed with type II diabetes five years ago at age 62. His most recent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4%. He underwent a right total knee arthroplasty two weeks ago. He does not smoke  consumes alcohol socially  and has a BMI of 29.34 suggestive of being overweight.  FAMILY HISTORY  His father died of colorectal cancer at age 74  and his mother had a stroke at age 82 but is still alive. The patient's sister  now aged 71  has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   CLINICAL FINDINGS  The patient's vital signs upon admission showed a pulse of 110 beats/minute  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 beats/minute  SpO2 around 92% at room air  and temperature of 98.6°F. The physical exam was unremarkable aside from tachycardia and tachypnea.  INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS  Due to his recent surgery  family history of DVT  and clinical presentation  there was high suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiogram  which showed filling defects in the pulmonary arteries of both lungs indicative of PE. D-dimer levels were notably elevated.  TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT  The patient was immediately started on intravenous heparin therapy. After clinical stabilization  he was switched to oral anticoagulant therapy for long-term management. A plan was made for outpatient follow up and monitoring.  SUMMARY  This case highlights the importance of considering the risk factors  such as recent surgery and personal/family history  in patients presenting with sudden  unexplained dyspnea. PE is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent grave complications and increase survival rates. Special considerations must also be made for the management of underlying conditions that can further complicate the condition  such as the patient's hypertension and diabetes. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,27,Patient Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   I. Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male named John  a small business owner who lives in suburban Massachusetts. John is a former smoker  having quit about a year ago after a 35-year habit. He is a moderate drinker and has been sedentary for the past few years due to increasing work pressures. John is married with two adult children and lives with his wife.  II. Past Medical History  John's past medical history includes hypertension and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus. Both conditions are well controlled with medication  diet  and exercise. In addition  John also has had hypercholesterolemia for which he uses Statins. His BMI score stands at 30.1  revealing him to be obese. He has a history of right total knee replacement about six months ago.  III. Family History   John’s paternal side has a history of cardiovascular disease  with his father passing away from a heart attack in his early 70s. Both his sibling and mother are alive with the older sibling suffering from coronary artery disease.  IV. Current Presentation   John was admitted to the ER complaining of abrupt onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. A physical examination revealed a tachypneic and anxious patient. His oxygen saturation stood at 89% initially and improved to 94% with supplemental oxygen. He showed signs of right-sided cardiac strain. DVT was suspected due to the finding of unilateral leg swelling.  V. Diagnosis and Management   With the sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and signs of DVT  John was initially stratified as high risk  promoting further investigation. A D-Dimer test result was high  which further intensified the suspicion. A subsequent CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   John was started on anticoagulation therapy  initially with low molecular weight heparin followed by warfarin. The primary strategy was to prevent further clot formation and embolization. The follow-up plan includes lifestyle modification advice about healthy diet & regular exercise to control BMI and manage hypertension and diabetes. He would also need regular monitoring of INR levels given the commencement of warfarin therapy.  VI. Likely Contributing Factors  John's sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking history  history of surgery (total knee replacement)  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular disease could have contributed to his developing an acute pulmonary embolism.  VII. Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with sudden dyspnea  chest pain  and DVT  especially in those with multiple risk factors. Once diagnosed  it is vital to initiate suitable pharmacological management and undertake necessary lifestyle changes to prevent further complications.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,30,Patient Information:  Victoria Sanchez  a 58-year-old Hispanic female  presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light headedness. She lives with her husband and two adult children in the urban area of Houston  Texas where she works as a middle school teacher.  Past Medical History:  She has a medical history of Hypertension (HTN) and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Her medications include Metformin 500mg twice daily and Lisinopril 10mg once daily. She has no surgical history but reports a history of multiple miscarriages during her 30s without any clear cause given by her doctors. There is no history of any known allergies. She does not smoke and has no history of illicit drug use  but she does have a moderate intake of alcohol (1-2 glasses of red wine per week).  Family History:  Her mother died at the age of 68 due to a stroke  and her father died at 72 due to complications related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). She also has a brother who is currently 55  diagnosed with prostate cancer. There are no reports of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in her family.  Physical Examination:  Upon arriving at the emergency room  Victoria was in acute distress. Her vitals showed a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  temperature 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation at 90% on room air. Physical examination revealed tachycardia and decreased breath sounds on the right lower lobe.  Investigations:  Considering her symptoms and physical examination findings  a D-dimer test was conducted showing elevated levels. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was immediately ordered showing a clot in the right pulmonary artery consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.  Plan and Treatment:  Given the patient's stable hemodynamics  but severe symptoms  she was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). With her high risk of recurrence due to her medical history and the presence of no contraindications  a long-term anticoagulant  Rivaroxaban was initiated for further management. Victoria was admitted to the critical care unit for close monitoring.  Discussion:  These findings are consistent with acute pulmonary embolism  which commonly presents as an abrupt onset dyspnea  chest pain  and hemoptysis. Patients with underlying disorders like hypertension and diabetes are at a higher risk. As per various literature  Hispanic individuals experience VTE at a lower incidence than non-Hispanic Whites; however  once a Hispanic individual is diagnosed with VTE  they are more at risk of recurrent VTE and related complications.   This case highlights the urgent need to ensure a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain  further stratifying the risk according to the specific ethnicity and health background of the patient. In all suspected cases  prompt diagnostic tests and pathway driven treatment are crucial in obtaining positive outcomes.

Management Plan: She was admitted to the hospital  with anticoagulation initiated immediately for her acute pulmonary embolism. Her vital signs and respiratory status are being monitored closely. She will continue anticoagulation with a discussion of long-term management after the acute phase. She was also referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program as part of her ongoing management and to reduce the risk of future events.  This case reflects the demographic group (African Americans and women) that has a higher prevalence of pulmonary embolism  as supported by literature. It highlights the importance of taking into account risk factors such as age  sedentary lifestyle  long-standing hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and family history of cardiovascular disease in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,34,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information and History:  The patient  Mr. H  is a 67-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and dizziness. The patient has a past medical history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease for which he is on medication  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and moderate obesity with a BMI of 31. He has a 20-pack-year history of smoking but quit eight years ago. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his family history is positive for myocardial infarctions; both of his parents had heart attacks in their late 60s.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. H described the chest pain as stabbing in character and localized to the right side of his chest. The pain intensified with deep breathing and there was associated dizziness. He mentioned a trip taken two weeks ago which required him to sit for several hours during the flight. There was no associated fever  cough  or sputum production.  Examination:  On examination  Mr. H was found to be in discomfort and had a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  heart rate of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg and oxygen saturations of 90% on room air. His cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs or gallop. Lung auscultation demonstrated decreased breath sounds in the right lung base.The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  An urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Mr. H’s Chest X-ray revealed no evidence of a pneumothorax or pneumonia. A D-dimer test was positive. Based on his risk factors and symptoms  computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism in the right lung.  Diagnosis and Management:  Mr. H was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. Following risk stratification  it was determined that Mr. H required immediate treatment with anticoagulants. His oxygen saturations were closely monitored and oxygen therapy was commenced. His medical history  the fact that he had traveled recently and his sedentary lifestyle had contributed to a high possibility of developing the condition. He was recommended to maintain good control of this hypertension and diabetes  take his anticoagulation therapy  follow a healthy diet and maintain physical fitness post-recovery.  This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain  especially those with predisposing factors such as prolonged immobilization  smoking history  and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,35,Patient Profile:  Ms. Thompson is a 65-year-old African American retired teacher who resides in the urban community of Chicago  Illinois. She lives alone but has a large supportive family network.  Chief Complaint:  The patient reported to the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp chest pain  which worsened when she took deep breaths.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Thompson has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension  which are well-controlled with medications. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and recently fractured her right tibia  necessitating inoperative management.  Family History:  She has a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father passed away from a heart attack at 62 and her mother died from a stroke at 78. Her brother is currently managing coronary artery disease. There is no known family history of pulmonary issues mentioned but her younger sister is also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Presenting Symptoms:  Upon examination  she appeared sweaty and anxious. The initial vital signs were blood pressure of 155/95 mmHG  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute  temperature 37.1 degrees Celsius  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  Diagnostic Procedure:  Given her symptoms and past medical history of DVT  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. D-dimer test was positive and the emergency CT pulmonary angiography showed a clot in the right pulmonary artery.  Plan of Management:  Ms. Thompson was immediately started on supplemental oxygen and IV unfractionated heparin. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring of her hemodynamic parameters. Further workup including a lower extremity venous Doppler confirmed the presence of DVT  the likely source of her Pulmonary Embolism.  Risk Factors:  Ms. Thompson's key risk factors include her age  African-American ethnicity  history of DVT  recent leg fracture  and immobility from the fracture  and her underlying conditions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  Follow-ups and Patient Education:  The plan for her is to switch from IV Heparin to oral anticoagulant after stabilization  with at least 3 months of anticoagulant therapy. She will need close follow-ups and patient education regarding lifestyle modification to manage her risk factors  signs and symptoms of PE and DVT  and about her medication needs  side effects  and importance of regular monitoring.  In conclusion  Ms. Thompson's acute pulmonary embolism was likely precipitated by her recent immobility from the fracture and her history of DVT. Early detection and immediate commencement of treatment could improve her prognosis. Multidisciplinary team care incorporating specialists  primary care clinicians  nurses  pharmacists  and physiotherapists is paramount for holistic care.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,36,Patient Presentation:  Subject: Mr. John A  a 67-year-old African American male   Presenting complaint: Severe chest pain and shortness of breath   The patient showed up to the ED with an acute onset of chest pain  dyspnea  and slight hemoptysis. The chest pain was pleuritic  localized to the right side  and worsened upon deep inspiration. The patient also reported experiencing palpitations and lightheadedness.   Medical history: The patient has a known ten-year history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension  controlled with prescribed medication (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors). He's also a survivor of stage II prostate cancer (treated with robotic prostatectomy and radiation therapy) and has been in remission for five years. The patient admits to a smoking history of approximately 20 pack-years but quit smoking ten years ago. He is marginally obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 31.  Family medical history: The patient's father died of a myocardial infarction at 56  and his mother had a stroke at 62. His younger sister recently had a deep vein thrombosis.  Medications: Amlodipine  Lisinopril  aspirin  and atorvastatin. He takes no allergies to drugs.  Physical findings: On examination  the patient appeared anxious and short of breath  but conscious and well-oriented. Oxygen saturation was reduced (90% on room air). Heart rate was mildly elevated (110bpm)  and blood pressure was high (145/95mmHg). Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side.  Diagnostic tests: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray was within normal limits with no sign of pneumonia or an enlarged heart  which suggested PE. D-dimer levels were elevated. The CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: The patient was started on low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) followed by oral anticoagulant warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. He was also given supplemental oxygen for hypoxia. The patient did well and was discharged with instructions for follow-up  adhering to his medication regimen  and managing potential risk factors  including weight loss.  This case underlines the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients with cardiovascular disease history who present with acute chest pain and dyspnea  especially when accompanied by risk factors like a personal and family history of thrombotic events and history of cancer.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,37,Patient Identification:  Mrs. Johnson is a 70-year-old African American female  from Seattle  Washington.  Chief Complaint: “I felt a sudden shortness of breath and tightness in my chest.”  History of Present Illness: Mrs. Johnson has been complaining of sudden  sharp  stabbing chest pain worsening with deep breaths for the last 24 hours. She has also reported experiencing recurrent shortness of breath and feeling fatigued over the same period.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery 2 weeks ago and has been on prophylactic low molecular weight heparins.  Family History: No family history of clotting disorders. Her mother died of stroke  while her father had cardiac disease.   Review of Systems: Examination reveals moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation of lungs shows decreased breath sound on the right side. There is also report of increased heart rate and lower extremity swelling  particularly in the right leg. Mental state  cognitive ability and neurological status are normal.  Diagnosis: Given her symptomology  her recent surgery  and the fact that African Americans have a reportedly 30-60% higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to European-Americans  a CT angiography was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention: Therapy was immediately begun with intravenous unfractionated heparin in the hospital.   Discussion: Mrs. Johnson's recent total knee replacement surgery  old age  hypertension  diabetes  and history of immobility due to post-operative recovery placed her at a higher risk for DVT  which likely led to pulmonary embolism. Despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation  she still developed a PE  this could be due to inadequate dosing or genetic susceptibility.  It is pivotal to scrutinize post-surgical patients  especially those with predisposing risk factors  for early detection and treatment of DVT/PE to decrease morbidity and mortality. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients.  Studies on racial and ethnic disparities in VTE show that African Americans have a higher rate of VTE and reoccurrence; however reasons for this are not entirely understood but may be due to a combination of genetic  clinical  and socio-economic factors.  Patient Education: Mrs. Johnson was provided with information about the signs and symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism and the importance of medication adherence. Her family was also educated on the same and their role in supporting Mrs. Johnson through her recovery process.  Follow-up: A close follow-up has been planned for Mrs. Johnson to manage her anticoagulant therapy and to identify any potential issues early. Holistic care involving physiotherapy  dietary planning  counselling and routine checkups are encouraged.   Reference: 1. White RH. The epidemiology of venous thromboembolism.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,38,Patient Profile Case Presentation: Mr. S  a 68-year-old Korean American male   Past Medical History: Before relating the details of his current condition  it is essential to note that Mr. S was diagnosed with chronic atrial fibrillation five years ago  which he had been managing with prescribed medications. Furthermore  he has also had a history of intermittent long-haul flights due to his line of work. However  he denies any history of thrombotic events himself or within his family.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. S reported to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that aggravates during deep inspiration  and low-grade fever for the past two days. He also mentioned feeling light-headed occasionally. He denied any other associated symptoms such as coughing  hemoptysis  lower limb swelling  or recent injuries.  Family History: His father died at the age of 74 from a heart attack  and his mother passed away at 81 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease. Mr. S has an elder sister who is 71 and is living a healthy life.  Social History: Married with two adult children  Mr. S retired from his corporate job four years ago. He's a non-smoker but does enjoy a glass of whisky on special occasions. His physical activity levels have decreased after retirement.   Investigations: His pulse was irregular at 120bpm  and his blood pressure was a bit high at 145/90 mmHg. The rest of General Physical Examination was unremarkable. Lab tests  such as complete blood count  coagulation parameters  liver and kidney function tests  were within normal limits except for D-dimer which was elevated at 1100 ng/mL (N: up to 500 ng/mL). An Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed changes consistent with acute right heart strain. A Computerized Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) was immediately ordered  which confirmed bilateral pulmonary embolism.   Clinical Course: Mr. S was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to the severity of symptoms and the acute nature of his PE. He was started on intravenous anticoagulants. His arrhythmia and cardiopulmonary status were closely monitored. After initial stabilization over five days  he was transitioned to oral anticoagulants.   Discussion: Considering Mr. S's past medical history of atrial fibrillation and prolonged periods of immobility due to long-haul flights  as well as presenting symptoms and investigations  the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was established. Literature reveals a high prevalence of pulmonary embolism in Asian populations  especially those aged between 65 and 75 years  and those with atrial fibrillation acting as a powerful predictor of the incident VTE.  Management: On discharge  Mr. S was counseled about the importance of taking his anticoagulant medication regularly and watch for any signs of easy or unexplained bleeding. He was also advised regular follow-ups for INR monitoring. Lifestyle modifications involving the adoption of an exercise routine  maintenance of a balanced diet  and avoidance of long hours of immobility were emphasized. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,39,Patient Case Presentation  Profile: Name: Mr. Andrew Cohen Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer Marital Status: Married Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Cohen arrived at the emergency department complaining of acute-onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath for a duration of approximately 6 hours. He also reported that he had fainted briefly at home before the onset of these symptoms.  Past Medical History: Mr. Cohen was diagnosed with Type-II diabetes four years ago and has also been hypertensive for approximately ten years. He is a former smoker (quit smoking five years ago after smoking one pack per day for thirty years). Mr. Cohen had an episode of DVT following surgery of his left knee joint five years ago. No known allergies.  Family History: Mother died at age 70 due to myocardial infarction  father died from complications of stroke at age 74. He has two siblings who are in good health.  Review of Symptoms: Mr. Cohen reported unexplained recent weight loss  along with occasional night sweats. He neglected these symptoms considering them consequences of aging.  Physical Examination: Initial physical examination revealed tachypnea (25 breaths/min) and tachycardia (110 bpm). BP was stable (130/85). Oxygen saturation decreased to 90% at rest.  Diagnostic Approach: Based on his clinical symptoms and history of DVT  a suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) was raised. D-dimer testing was ordered that resulted as positive. Further  a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest confirmed the presence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Management: The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. Anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was started immediately.  Follow-up: Long-term anticoagulation treatment is being considered and will be guided by further diagnostic evaluation. Genetic and oncology consultations will be arranged as part of the workup due to the history of malignancy in his mother and to further diagnose his unexplained weight loss and night sweats.  Summary: This case represents a patient who has multiple risk factors for PE  including a history of past DVT  recent unexplained weight loss  and night sweat. Early recognition  correct diagnosis  and initiation of empiric anticoagulation based on clinical suspicion likely significantly decreased patient morbidity and potential mortality.   Importance:  This case highlights the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with chest pain  especially when they have a history of DVT  regardless of far in the past  and other cardiorespiratory diseases. Considering the age group and certain disease histories of the patient  it mirrors accurate demographic representation found in literature associated with PE. According to the study by Smith et al.  people aged 40-79 years  with previous history of DVT  and with certain specific comorbidities (e.g.  cancer) are at higher risk for PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,40,Patient Introduction: The patient  a 62-year-old Caucasian female named Ms. A  was presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of sudden shortness of breath and sharp chest pain. She had a slightly increased heart rate and blood pressure  with assessments noting a SpO2 of 92% on room air. Ms. A is a smoker and has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is post-menopausal and on hormone replacement therapy. She does not consume alcohol and lives alone.  Medical History: Ms. A has a past medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition  she had an episode of DVT five years ago  for which she had been prescribed warfarin. However  she is irregular with her medication owing to her reported forgetfulness. She has a sedentary lifestyle linked with her job as a telephone switchboard operator.  Family History: Ms. A’s father passed away in his early 70s due to a myocardial infarction  and her mother  currently 88-years-old  suffers from advanced rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease. She does not have any siblings but has a daughter who lives interstate.  Case Presentation: On physical examination  Ms. A appeared anxious  struggling with her breath. Her heart rate was 103 bpm  respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute  and blood pressure was elevated at 155/92 mmHg. Auscultation of lungs showed reduced breath sounds in the lower right lung field. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of infarction.  A CT Pulmonary Angiography was ordered  confirming the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery  leading to a provisional diagnosis of severe acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Blood tests showed raised D-dimer levels  hyperglycemia  and elevated markers of pan-cardiac strain.  Treatment and Progress: Ms. A was started on intravenous heparin and oxygen therapy immediately. The severity and suddenness of her symptoms necessitated thrombolytic therapy  which was administered following the confirmation of no contraindications. Ms. A’s symptoms gradually improved over the next 72 hours. Throughout her stay  she was educated on the importance of medication adherence and smoking cessation.  Since pulmonary embolisms are often recurrent  a long-term anticoagulant warfarin was prescribed  and she was referred to a hematologist. Patient education was included in her discharge plan  emphasizing lifestyle changes to reduce her risk factors.  This case presentation demonstrates the critical principle of the timely and efficient management of acute pulmonary embolism  recognition of risk factors  and the need for compliance in addressing chronic medical conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,41,Patient Presentation:  Mr. S is a 68-year-old African American retired businessman with a BMI of 31.9  presenting with symptoms of sudden-onset extreme difficulty in breathing  chest discomfort and light-headedness. He has no history of smoking and also denies substance use. He does have a personal medical history significant for chronic atrial fibrillation  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. These conditions are managed with medications including a beta-blocker  statins  and anticoagulants.   His key surgical history incorporates a total knee replacement two years ago. Notably  he had not been adherent to prophylaxis anticoagulant regimen after the surgery. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother had a stroke at 72. The patient reports no known drug allergies.  Clinically  his vital signs show tachycardia  tachypnea and hypoxia with a blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% while on room air. Chest examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side.  Given the clinical presentation and medical history  a CT pulmonary angiogram is performed  confirming the presence of large emboli in the central right pulmonary arteries  indicative of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Mr. S is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and is immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation. A decision is taken not to proceed with thrombolytic therapy due to the risk of hemorrhage. The underlying cause of the acute pulmonary embolism is likely due to the patient's chronic atrial fibrillation and his lack of adherence to his prescribed anticoagulant regimen after his knee surgery. Above-mentioned lifestyle factors including obesity have likely also contributed.   For this patient  several interventions are suggested: medical adherence counselling  diet and exercise regimen to decrease BMI  and education on the importance of anticoagulant therapy adherence to reduce the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism.  This case is a typical example of a 68-year-old male patient with recognized risk factors for pulmonary embolism  namely obesity  history of surgery  AFib. It reflects the demographics of PE patients as found in literature. Confirming the role of consistent risk factor management in these individuals.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,42,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old African American male  Mr. Smith  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. He reports that his symptoms started a few hours ago. He rates his pain level as 7 out of 10 on the pain scale and says it's worse with deep breaths. Mr. Smith also has a medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. He has a BMI of 28  suggesting an overweight issue. He denies smoking but reports a sedentary lifestyle with a moderate intake of alcohol.  His family history reveals that his father suffered a stroke at the age of 65  and his maternal uncle had a deep vein thrombosis. No history of any genetic or hereditary diseases is present as per the information available. His medication history suggests compliance with prescribed medications. He mentioned a recent plane trip that took approximately 12 hours  but no trauma or surgery in the recent past.   Investigations:  His vital signs show a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  and BP 150/90 mmHg. An ECG revealed sinus tachycardia  a chest X-ray was normal  and D-Dimer was significantly elevated.   Diagnosis:  Based on the Wells’ criteria for PE  the patient had a high probability of PE  as he had scores of >6. The clinical symptoms along with the significant rise in D-dimer concentration and his recent  long-duration travel led us to suspect acute pulmonary embolism. This was confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiogram  which revealed a clot in the pulmonary artery.   Management:   The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on an IV heparin drip. After relative stabilization  he was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for long-term management.  Follow-ups:  The patient would need regular follow-up to monitor his INR levels  general physical health  and management of pre-existing conditions. Patient education regarding mobility  hydration  and regular exercises were recommended to prevent the recurrence of the condition.  This case emphasizes that early detection  coupled with prompt and adequate management  is vital in managing acute pulmonary embolism  a frequently missed diagnosis. It also reflects that medical professionals should be alert to risk factors  such as prolonged immobilization and personal/family history of thrombosis in similar settings.

Relevant Diagnostic Findings  Vital signs upon admission show BP 160/100  Heart rate 120/min  RR 24/min  and Oxygen saturation 88% on room air. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs disclosed deep venous thrombosis in the left calf veins. A subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of bilateral occlusion of pulmonary arteries  establishing the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Family History  Her father was diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his 60s and her mother had a stroke in her 70s. Her maternal aunt also had a history of deep vein thrombosis  suggestive of a possible genetic predisposition for thrombotic diseases.  Management  The patient was stat started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin while maintaining cardiorespiratory support. She was also placed on a statin for her anamnestic dyslipidemia  connected to supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%  and counselled on the importance of lifestyle modifications  including dietary changes  regular exercise  and the potential benefits of quitting alcohol.  Hospital Course  Under the initiated therapy  Mrs. L.B's symptoms improved over a week  with normalization of vital signs and oxygen saturation. By the end of the second week  clot resolution was seen on repeat imaging.  Conclusion and Future Recommendations  The case emphasizes the potential dangers of sedentary lifestyle  particularly in patients with other predisposing factors for thrombosis. For patients struggling with pulmonary embolism  early detection and prompt treatment are paramount for preventing morbidity and mortality. Post-discharge  Mrs. L.B was recommended to consult with her primary care physician regularly  to monitor her anticoagulation therapy and maintain control of her diabetes and hypertension. Additionally  she was referred to a physiotherapist to initiate a regime that will facilitate a more active lifestyle.   Demographic data used for this case mirrors national statistics that indicate a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in African American women  both of which are potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism. Age and female gender are recognised risk factors for thrombotic diseases  which are also coherent with this case.

He is a non-smoker and admits that his alcohol consumption is occasional and moderate. He denies substance abuse. He lives with his wife and 3 children.  Presenting Problem:  The patient came into the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. His breathing was quick and shallow  and he appeared visibly distressed. He denies cough  fever  or any recent trauma. He mentioned that he recently underwent an orthopedic surgery on his left knee after an accident at work about two weeks earlier. He hasn’t been active since the surgery and spent most of his time in bed.  Medical and Family History: The patient's known past medical history include benign prostate hyperplasia  hypertension  which is currently well-controlled through medication  and obesity  with a Body Mass Index of 30.6 kg/m2. There is no history of respiratory illnesses  such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   His family history reveals that his father died of a stroke at the age of 60  and his mother has well-controlled Type 2 Diabetes. He has an older brother who underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease at the age of 50. There is no known history of blood clotting disorders in the family.  Clinical Examination: Vital signs at the time of initial examination showed a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 25 breaths per min  oxygen saturation 92% on room air  and temperature 98.6°F. On physical examination  it was noted that the chest was clear to auscultation while heart sounds were normal with no murmurs.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Given his recent history of postoperative immobilization  sudden onset of symptoms  and the findings on physical examination  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. D-dimer levels were elevated. A subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery.  This patient’s case illustrates the importance of considering Acute Pulmonary Embolism in any patient presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  especially in a setting such as recent surgery and immobilization which are known risk factors for the condition.

He presented to the emergency room with acute dyspnea and chest pain that has been intermittently occurring for the past 72 hours. The pain was non-radiating  sharp  and exacerbated by deep breaths.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is a known case of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago. He is compliant with his medications - losartan 50mg daily for hypertension and metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes. He had a transient ischemic attack 3 years ago  for which he takes low-dose aspirin daily. His diabetes and hypertension are fairly controlled. He doesn't smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally (social drinker)  with no history of drug abuse.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at 68  and his mother passed due to breast cancer at 72. His older brother (age 60) has coronary artery disease and is post-MI. He has a younger sister (age 54) with no significant health disorders.  Physical Examination: On presentation  Mr. Doe was oriented but appeared anxious and in distress. His heart rate was 110 beats per minute  his respirations were 26 per minute  blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed reduced breath sounds on the right lower side with no wheeze or crepitations.  Investigations: Standard lab tests  including complete blood count  liver and renal function tests  were within normal limits except for a slightly raised Troponin I level. His D-dimer level was significantly elevated. A chest X-ray was unremarkable. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) revealed acute pulmonary emboli in the lateral basal segmental arteries of the right lower lobe.   Given the history of a sedentary lifestyle  active treatment was initiated immediately after the diagnosis. He was started on parenteral anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin  and plans were made for a transition to long-term oral anticoagulation.  Hospital Course: Mr. Doe's hospital course was uneventful. His symptoms improved significantly on anticoagulation therapy. A plan was made for long-term anticoagulation  monitoring  patient education about his condition and warning symptoms  promotion of physical activity  and regular follow-ups.   This case was interesting like it's a classic case of co-existing morbidities potentially contributing to an acute pulmonary embolism. Mr. Doe will require careful monitoring and management to reduce the risk of future thromboembolic events. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,46,Patient Presentation  The patient  Mr. E.T.  is a 59-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that occurred three hours prior to admission. The pain was described as sharp and stabbing  radiating to his left shoulder and intensified with deep breaths. Mr. E.T. also reported experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness. He denied any recent trauma  cough  or fever but mentioned recent prolonged immobility due to a knee replacement surgery three weeks prior. He has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  currently managed with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). Mr. E.T. is a 20-pack-year smoker but quit five years ago. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs and is retired.

Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. The remainder of his examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute right heart strain.   Based on his recent orthopedic procedure  clinical symptoms  and ECG findings  a presumptive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made. D-dimer assay was elevated. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis showing multiple filling defects in the left lower lobe pulmonary arteries. Anticoagulation therapy was promptly initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  and he was admitted for further management. These included a medical review for long-term anticoagulation options  assessment of underlying thrombophilias  providing education on lifestyle modifications  potential risks  and ensuring a robust follow-up care plan.  This case signifies the importance of a detailed medical history  including recent surgeries and family history of any coagulopathies in assessing individuals with acute onset dyspnea  chest pain  and relevant physical findings. These are all high-risk factors associated with acute pulmonary embolism.   Note: Please modify details of this case simulation as needed to fit your specific needs.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,47,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. Jones Age: 55 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Engineer Family History: Father died of a heart attack at the age of 62; Mother has hypertension   Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has been a smoker for about 15 years  with an average of 10 cigarettes a day. His medical history includes controlled hypertension and type II diabetes. He has been on a prescriptive regimen of metformin (500mg once daily) and lisinopril (10mg once daily) to manage the said conditions. Mr. Jones had a past record of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around two years ago  which was managed using anticoagulant treatment.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Jones came to the emergency department complaining of sudden-onset breathlessness and chest pain  which got worse with deep breathing. He also mentioned he had been experiencing a dry cough for the last few days.   Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared visibly anxious and was sweating profusely. His pulse rate was 105 beats/min  BP was 130/82 mmHg  respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min  and his oxygen saturation on room air was 90%. There were no significant findings on the heart examination. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes of the right lung  without any wheezing or rales.  Laboratory Results:  His D-Dimer was found to be elevated. Blood tests demonstrated elevated cardiac troponins and Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed findings of sinus tachycardia. Due to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms  past medical history of DVT  an urgent CT Pulmonary angiogram was performed which confirmed a significant clot in one of the right pulmonary arteries  pointing to acute pulmonary embolism.  Management:  The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy  with unfractionated heparin as acute management followed by oral anticoagulants for long-term treatment. He was admitted for further evaluation and management  which included routine blood tests  vital sign monitoring  and patient education on pulmonary embolism and its future prevention.   This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in patients with sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain  particularly in individuals with risk factors such as history of DVT  smoking  and presence of other diseases like hypertension and diabetes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,48,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Henry Rodriguez  a 66-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and a sense of impending doom. He has a past medical history that is significant for hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and an old myocardial infarction (MI).   His weight is 200 lbs. (BMI: 29.3)  indicating overweight  and he confessed that he remains mostly sedentary due to his COPD. Mr. Rodriguez is a retired construction worker  living in Santa Barbara with his wife. He has a 50 pack-year history of smoking  though he quit 10 years ago.   His family history includes a dad who died at the age of 72 from complications of heart disease and stroke and a younger brother who suffered from deep vein thrombosis. Unfortunately  Mr. Rodriguez was recently immobilized for a week due to an elective knee replacement surgery approximately 2 weeks ago. Unemployment during COVID-19 has caused him a lot of stress and potentially influenced the onset of his symptoms.   Upon examination  he appears to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute  SpO2 of 88% on room air  blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  heart rate of 490 bpm and temperature of 37.4 °C. Physical examination reveals right-sided chest wall tenderness.   Based on the history  physical examination  and risk factors  a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. His high-risk factors include age  previous surgery  family history of blood clots  COPD  hypertension  and historical smoking. Knowing Hispanic men are often underrepresented in health research  it is important to ensure patient-centered communication and culturally appropriate care for Mr. Rodriguez. The next steps would be confirmation with a CT pulmonary angiogram  EKG  and D-dimer test  followed by appropriate treatment.   In conclusion  adequate and early detection of pulmonary embolism can aid in reducing morbidity and mortality. Regular monitoring and lifestyle changes may also be advised to prevent future episodes. Consultation with a pulmonologist can be valuable  particularly considering the pre-existing COPD condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,49,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Information: Patient X is a 68-year-old Hispanic female of lower socio-economic status who was admitted due to severe dyspnea and a recent history of a long car travel. The patient works as a cleaner and has a prior history of obesity (BMI 30.5)  type 2 diabetes  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is a lifelong non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She was prescribed anticoagulants after her DVT but admits to not taking the medication regularly because it is too expensive. She has limited access to healthcare due to her financial constraints and transportation limitations.   Family History: The patient also reported a family history of cardiovascular disease with her father passing away early at the age of 50 due to a myocardial infarction. Her mother  currently living aged 85  was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presented to the Emergency Room with shortness of breath  chest pain  and fainting  all symptoms that had gotten progressively worse over the past week. The patient's pulse was rapid  and her blood pressure was high (150/95 mmHg). Her skin was cold  and she appeared anxious with signs of respiratory distress.  Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms and history  the ED physician suspected an acute pulmonary embolism. A CT angiography was ordered and revealed an emboli in her left lung  confirming the diagnosis. She scored a high risk on the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI score: 125)  making immediate treatment necessary.  Clinical Management: Given her condition and financial constraints  the patient was admitted to the ICU and started on intravenous heparin. As her risk for further emboli is high  considering her obesity  history of DVT  and poor medication adherence  long-term anticoagulation will be mandatory. In an effort to manage costs  warfarin  a less expensive anticoagulant  will be prescribed after discharge. The patient will need regular INR checks to monitor her response to warfarin treatment. She will also be referred to social services to ensure medication adherence and find a sustainable healthcare setup.  Outlook: Obstacles to providing optimal care in this patient include her low socioeconomic status that impacts her ability to afford medications  limited access to regular healthcare  and her high-risk status due to comorbidities and family history. Prioritizing resources towards aggressive management of her obesity and diabetes  and putting strategies in place for ensuring medication compliance may yield better outcomes in the future.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,50,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year old Caucasian female diagnosed recently with acute pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to emergency with complaints of sudden-onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient also reported light-headedness  leg swelling  and a rapid heartbeat. She lives in a suburban community and is a retired school teacher.   Patient's Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right lower leg dating back to approximately six years ago  high blood pressure  and hyperlipidemia. She had surgery for a knee replacement 2 months ago. She had been on warfarin for the DVT but was non-compliant due to regular blood tests which caused her great distress. She has also been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for the last 45 years. The patient did not report any allergies.  Family Medical History:  Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 80. Her father had been diagnosed with lung cancer at 76 due to chronic smoking and passed away within a year of diagnosis. She has two siblings. Her elder brother had a heart attack in his early fifties and is now on regular cardiac medication. The younger sister is healthy.  Laboratory Results and Diagnosis:  Investigations revealed an elevated D-dimer level. ECG showed signs of right ventricle strain. Imaging through Computed Tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral acute pulmonary embolism. EchoCardiography showed signs of right ventricular dysfunction.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Treatment includes immediate anticoagulation therapy with heparin and later followed with warfarin. The patient was also advised to quit smoking and was provided resources and support for the same. As the patient had a concern with regular INR monitoring required by warfarin therapy  the possibility of newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) was discussed with her.   Patient Behavior and Compliance:  The patient showed willingness to quit smoking and to manage her condition actively. She agreed to switch to NOAC for long-term management of her condition and to prevent recurrent DVT or PE.  Follow-up and Prognosis:  The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in two weeks to monitor her response to therapy. Considering her age  medical history  and lifestyle  the chances of recurrent PE/DVT are appreciably high  requiring her to be conscientious about her medication regimen. She is also referred to a dietitian for control of hyperlipidemia and a counselor for smoking cessation. She was educated about the critical importance of regular health check-ups and medication compliance.

He works as an IT Professional  often leading an inactive lifestyle due to his job nature. He is married with two adult children.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension and was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is currently controlled through diet and oral hypoglycemic. For his hypertension  he has been religiously taking his prescribed amlodipine for the last 10 years.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rajesh presented with an abrupt onset of dyspnea and sharp  unilateral chest pain that worsened on deep inspiration. He also reported a minor episode of hemoptysis.  Examination & Investigations: On physical examination  he was anxious  tachypneic  and had reduced breath sounds on the right lower lung field. His blood oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. A D-Dimer test was done which came back positive. Confirming the suspicion  CTPA (CT pulmonary angiogram) revealed a clot obstructing the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. Lower extremity duplex ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis.  Risk Factors: Rajesh has several risk factors for developing a Pulmonary Embolism (PE) which include a sedentary lifestyle owing to his job  high blood pressure  recent long-haul travel  and diabetes mellitus.  Family History: His father died following a heart attack at the age of 60. His mother had a stroke at 68 years old  but currently living with him and his wife. His younger brother has been diagnosed with obesity and hypertension.  Management: Mr. Rajesh was admitted to the ICU and was given LMWH followed by oral anticoagulation. A stat echocardiogram was done which didn't show any signs of right heart strain. His condition improved after initiating the treatment.  Patient Education: Rajesh has been further educated on the importance of routine physical activity  weight management  medication compliance and routine check-ups. He has been advised with lifestyle modifications and early signs and symptoms of PE to watch out for.  Follow-up: Rajesh will have a one-month follow-up appointment to monitor his coagulation profile and will continue to be on the oral anticoagulant as guided by the haematologist. His diabetes and hypertension management will also be addressed during his follow-up visits.   Summary: This case illustrates the relationship of PE with hypertension  diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. Despite negative findings for deep vein thrombosis  clinicians must remain vigilant to PE's signs and symptoms.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,52,Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  has been admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Johnson arrived at the emergency department presenting dyspnea  chest pain and lightheadedness that started approximately five hours prior. The pains were sudden  with constant intensity  not related to physical effort.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was recently diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer  for which he is currently receiving chemotherapy. He has a history of hypertension which has been usually well-controlled with losartan. His chart also indicates mild obesity with a body mass index of 32. He reached menopause at 52 years of age. He does not smoke or ingest alcohol.  Family History: His mother died due to a stroke at age 75 and his father died in his 60s due to complications of atherosclerosis. One of his two siblings had deep vein thrombosis in her late 40s.  Review of Systems: The patient reported shortness of breath while taking little effort over the past two days. He also noticed mild but generalized body weakness and slight nausea in this period. His appetite has been poor but denied any palpitations or syncope.  Physical Examination: Vitals: BP 150/90 mm Hg  HR 110 bpm  RR 22 breaths per min  Temp 99°F  O2 90% on Room Air Appearance: Patient appears anxious  diaphoretic Chest: Decreased breath sounds and slight crackles on the right lower lung field. Heart: Tachycardic  regular rhythm without murmur Extremities: No edema  warm  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia without obvious ST changes and no significant Q-waves. The D-Dimer level was highly elevated  based on which a CT pulmonary angiogram was done and revealed a large clot in the right main pulmonary artery. His troponin level was slightly elevated  suggesting possible strain on the right ventricle.  Treatment: The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy using low molecular weight heparin. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess right heart function. He was also given supplemental oxygen and put on continuous monitoring. His primary oncologist was also notified about the event.  Discussion: This case underscores the relationship between malignancies and thrombotic events. Patients with cancer have a 4-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism  including pulmonary embolism. Further  anticoagulation therapy in patients with cancer should be continued for as long as the cancer is active. The decision regarding the time to start chemotherapy in the context of a recent pulmonary embolism would need to be individualized.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,53,Patient Presentation: Mr. D  a 68-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset difficulty in breathing  intermittent chest pain  and lightheadedness that started two days prior. He reported a dry cough but denied any fever  hemoptysis  or recent illnesses. His heart rate was 102 beats per minute  and his respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air.  Past Medical History: Mr. D's medical history is significant for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are well-controlled on medications. He had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 10 years prior with uneventful recovery. He quit smoking 20 years ago but had a 30-pack year history prior to quitting.   Demographics: He is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He is socioeconomically stable and resides in an urban area.   Family History: The patient's father had coronary artery disease and his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. There is no history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the family.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appeared anxious and short of breath  using accessory muscles for respiration. There was no cyanosis  swelling  or calf tenderness. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. Cardiovascular examination showed tachycardia with no murmurs.  Clinical Reasoning: In view of his recent immobility due to sustained periods of sitting while watching TV post his retirement  the sudden onset of symptoms  and the clinical findings  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected.  Diagnostic Process: His D-Dimer levels came back significantly elevated. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis with a large clot seen in the right pulmonary artery extending into its branches. His EKG showed signs of acute right heart strain (S1Q3T3 pattern).   Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. D was immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation as per guidelines and admitted to the intensive care unit due to the size of the clot and the significant symptoms. His oxygen requirements were met with supplemental oxygen.   Patient's Perspective: Mr. D expressed concern about his sudden illness  asking various questions about pulmonary embolism. Patient education was provided  emphasizing the importance of mobility and adherence to anticoagulation therapy.  Outcome: Mr. D responded well to anticoagulation therapy. His respiratory status and symptoms improved over the following days. After his discharge from the hospital  he was placed on long-term anticoagulation and was enrolled in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Regular monitoring of his anticoagulant therapy was set up.  Consideration of Health Disparities: Low awareness about VTE contributes to late presentation and worse outcomes. Educational interventions can play a significant role in this regard  focusing on high-risk groups such as African-Americans and those with sedentary lifestyles.   This case illustrates the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for acute PE in patients presenting with sudden dyspnea  chest pain  and hypoxia  especially those at risk for thromboembolic disease. Anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of management  stressing the importance of patient education about medication adherence.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,54,Patient Case Presentation  Identifying Information:  The patient  Mr. A  is a 67-year-old African-American male who resides in Tulsa  Oklahoma  USA. He is a retired high school teacher and lives with his wife in a seven-room bungalow.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. A visited the Emergency Department (ED) with chief complaints of sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness that has progressively worsened over the past 2-3 hours.  Medical  Family  and Social History:  Mr. A's medical history reveals that he has been managing Type II Diabetes and Hypertension for the past seven years. He takes Metformin (500mg twice a day for diabetes) and Losartan (50mg once daily for hypertension). He was a smoker for 30 years but quit smoking five years ago. There's no history of substance or alcohol abuse. He maintains a regular exercise routine and has a healthy diet.  Mr. A's family history is significant as both parents died at an early age due to cardiovascular diseases. His father died of a Myocardial Infarction at the age of 65  and his mother had a stroke at 70.  Mr. A has traveled by plane recently – an 8 hour long haul flight two days before his visit to the ED. He complained of slight swelling and discomfort in his left calf since travel but didn't seek medical attention.  Physical Examination and Investigation:  Upon examination in the ED  Mr. A appeared anxious and diaphoretic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min  heart rate of 112 beats/min  blood pressure of 155/95 mm/Hg  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 (overweight range).  An Electrocardiogram (ECG) suggested signs of acute right ventricular strain. C-reactive protein levels were elevated at 3.8 mg/dl(normal: <0.5mg/dl). D-Dimer  a blood tests that helps rule out a clot  was significantly raised at 3200 ng/mL(normal: <500 ng/mL). Chest radiograph showed no signs of pneumonia  but the CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Diagnosis and Management:  Based on the history  clinical findings  and results from investigations  Mr. A was diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  He was started on oxygen supplementation and anticoagulation therapy with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) initially  and then oral anticoagulants  targeting an INR of 2 to 3. Counseling regarding the risks and benefits of therapy  possible side-effects  and the importance of regular follow-up was emphasized.  Outcome:  With early and appropriate medical intervention  Mr. A's condition started improving after 48 hours of hospitalization. He was discharged after a week with follow-up appointments scheduled. It is recommended that Mr. A continues his anticoagulation therapy for at least three months and re-evaluation done as required.  Mr. A's case emphasizes the importance of considering the risk of venous thromboembolism  particularly pulmonary embolism  in patients with sudden onset dyspnea and recent travel history  notwithstanding any other risk factors.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,55,Patient Presentation  Patient ID: 52-year-old African American female  Medical History: This patient suffers from obesity with a BMI of 30.5 and a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has a 15-year-history of hypertension which is reasonably controlled with hydrochlorothiazide  lisinopril  and amlodipine  and she is on metformin for diabetes. The patient smokes one pack of cigarettes daily and has done so for the past 20 years. She has no known drug allergies.  Family History: Her mother died from heart disease around age 68 and also had hypertension and diabetes. She has one younger brother alive and healthy. There is no history of bleeding disorders in her family.   Pre-illness State: Prior to the current episode  the patient was already under a physician’s care and was managing her hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus with prescribed medications.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dyspnea and sharp  pleuritic chest pain. She also reported feeling faint and having a quickened heart rate.  ER Result: Upon examination  the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress and tachypnea. Blood pressure was 130/70  pulse was 110 beats per minute  SPO2 was 88 on room air. Initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no signs of right heart strain.   Imaging and Labs: A D-dimer test was positive. The ER team ordered a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) which confirmed the presence of multiple emboli in both pulmonary arteries.  Treatment and Recommendation: The patient was  therefore  diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism. The ER physician initiated treatment immediately with anticoagulation to prevent more clots from forming. Low molecular weight heparin was administered followed by oral rivaroxaban. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further monitoring and management.  The patient received counseling on the importance of lifestyle changes and medication adherence. Specifically  emphasis was put on the importance of weight loss  smoking cessation  and medication adherence for her current conditions (hypertension and diabetes) which put her further at risk for other health conditions. The importance of medication adherence in the prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism was also emphasized.   Follow-up Plan: The patient will require close follow-ups to monitor for recurrent symptoms and to ensure she remains therapeutic on anticoagulation. Further evaluation will also be necessary to rule out any other sources of emboli.  This case represents a realistic case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  being consistent with the literature that highlights a prevalence among African American individuals  and showing common risk factors including obesity  smoking  diabetes  and hypertension.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,56,Patient Profile: Mr. James Walker  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. He is a retired teacher  a non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption. He is married with two children and lives in an urban setting. He's somewhat overweight with a BMI of 28.   Past Medical History: Mr. Walker has several factors contributing to an increased risk of acute pulmonary embolism. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been well managed with medication. Approximately six weeks prior  he underwent an elective total knee replacement  which necessitated prolonged immobility. He has been receiving outpatient physical therapy since the operation.   Family History: Family history reveals his father had coronary artery disease and passed away from myocardial infarction. His mother was diabetic and died from complications related to diabetes. He has one brother who had a pulmonary embolism at age 50 and is currently in good health.   Presenting Symptoms: He was rushed to the ER after experiencing sudden onset sharp chest pain that got worse with deep breaths  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. Vital signs upon admission were HR 105 bpm  BP 140/90 mmHg  RR 22/min  temperature 98.6 F  and Oxygen Saturation 92% on room air.  Lab tests and Diagnostics: Bloodwork revealed elevated D-dimer levels. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no sign of myocardial infarction. CT pulmonary angiogram was conclusive for acute pulmonary embolism.   Diagnosis: Based on his recent orthopedic surgery  clinical presentation  and diagnostic imaging  Mr. Walker has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism likely secondary to deep vein thrombosis.   Treatment Plan: He was started on low-molecular-weight heparin as immediate treatment for the pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation is the primary treatment  along with oxygen therapy as needed. His condition will be closely monitored in ICU  and if he responds well to the treatment  he will be switched over to oral anticoagulants. He will be educated about the risk factors of his condition and necessary lifestyle modifications.  This case emphasizes the importance of post-operative care for immobilizing procedures as a risk factor for development of deep vein thrombosis and consequently  pulmonary embolism. Regular mobility and leg exercises  wearing compression stockings  and prophylactic anticoagulation if necessary are preventative measures to consider in high-risk patients.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,57,Patient Presentation  Patient ID: 12345 Name: Ms. A Age: 65 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: African-American (Literature indicates a slightly higher incidence among African-Americans compared with Caucasians)  History of Chief Complaint: Ms. A presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and mild chest pain that started a few hours ago. She describes the pain as a “sharp” sensation on the right side of the chest that increases with deep breaths.   Past Medical History: Ms. A is a known hypertensive and has been on medication for the past 15 years. Three months ago  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery on her right knee.  Family History: Family history indicates hypercholesterolemia in her father and a recent myocardial infarction in her elder brother.  Social History: Ms. A is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband. She is a non-smoker and refrains from alcohol.  Clinical Evaluation: Upon medical examination  she had an elevated respiratory rate (22 breaths/minute)  normal blood pressure (130/80 mmHg)  and increased heart rate (110 beats/minute). She demonstrated signs of mild distress. Her O2 saturation was 94% while breathing ambient air. Aside from right knee surgery scar  physical examination findings were unremarkable.  Imaging: A CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered which revealed the presence of a clot in the lobar artery of the right lung  confirming Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE).   D-Dimer levels were elevated which further supported the diagnosis of PE. Cardiac enzymes were within the normal reference range  excluding myocardial infarction.  Treatment: Given her hemodynamic stability  she was started on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). She was also recommended to continue with antihypertensive medication.  Prognosis and Plan: Considering her previous immobilization due to knee surgery  she falls under the high-risk category for thromboembolic disease. Hence  she needs to adhere strictly to anticoagulant therapy  regular follow-ups  and participate in appropriate physical activity.  At the time of discharge  Ms. A and her family were educated about PE  its symptoms  importance of medication compliance  and when to seek emergency help. She is scheduled for regular monitoring of her coagulation profile and health status.  Summary: This case illustrates Acute Pulmonary Embolism in an elderly female with risks factors including recent knee surgery and hypertension. Her prompt presentation to emergency services  immediate investigation  and initiation of anticoagulant treatment were pivotal in her stable condition at discharge. Future case management will involve regular check-ups and stringent compliance to medication.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,58,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Anna Mercier  a 62-year-old Caucasian female  was brought to the emergency department (ED) with sudden shortness of breath  palpitations  and chest pain radiating to her left arm. Previously  the patient had been living an active lifestyle with no significant complaints.   Medical History:  Her past medical history is significant for hypothyroidism  for which she has been on levothyroxine  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin. She underwent a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) four weeks ago  with a subsequent period of immobility post the surgery. There were no signs indicating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during her recovery period. Patient denies smoking but admits to occasional alcohol use.   Family History:  Her father had a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in his late 60s and died early at age 70 due to myocardial infarction  and her mother has osteoporosis.  Clinical Presentation:  In the ED  her heart rhythm was tachycardic with a rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure was 135/85  respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 90%. Her body mass index was 31  indicating obesity.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given the sudden onset of symptoms along with her recent lower limb surgery  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. A D-dimer test was ordered which was significantly elevated. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed acute pulmonary embolism.   Treatment:  She was initiated immediately on oxygen therapy and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) while being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).  Discussion:  The risk factors in our patient  who was diagnosed with acute PE  include recent TKA surgery with a period of immobility  a family history of VTE  obesity  and her advanced age. According to the current guidelines  the patient was promptly started on anticoagulation with LMWH.  Plan:  The plan will be to monitor the patient closely  ensuring stability and improvement in symptoms. Upon discharge  she will transition to oral anticoagulation for a period of at least three months  per VTE guidelines. She will also be referred to physical therapy to improve mobility  and nutrition service will be consulted for her obesity.  Conclusion:  This case urges the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE in patients presenting with acute onset of dyspnea  chest pain  and tachycardia  especially if they have risk factors such as surgery  family history of VTE  advanced age  and obesity. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with PE. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,59,Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 60-year-old African American male  presenting with right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath.  Chief Complaint: Acute onset right-chest pain  worse on deep inspiration  associated with unexpected shortness of breath.  History of Present illness: Mr. Johnson began feeling sharp  stabbing chest pain on his right side 3 days ago. The pain increased with deep breaths  and he noticed progressively worsening shortness of breath while performing routine activities.   Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of deep vein thrombosis in his left calf about two years ago. He also has hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both fairly well-controlled with medications. The patient denies smoking and alcohol consumption but mentions a sedentary lifestyle due to a desk job.  Medications: He is currently on metoprolol (beta-blocker) and hydralazine (a vasodilator) for hypertension  metformin for diabetes  and was on anticoagulation therapy (warfarin) after his DVT episode.   Family History: The patient’s father had a history of chronic heart disease and passed away at age 70 due to a heart attack.  Physical Examination: The patient is in moderate distress due to dyspnea and chest pain. Vitals: BP 155/90  HR 98  Temp 98.6 F  RR 22. Oxygen saturation is 94%. Auscultation reveals normal heart sounds but slightly decreased breath sounds on the lower right lung.  Diagnostic Evaluation: ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST or T wave changes. Chest X-ray did not show pneumonia or pneumothorax. D-Dimer came back positive. Subsequent Computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Presentation of Case Summary: Mr. Johnson  a 60-year-old man with a history of DVT  hypertension  and diabetes  presented with acute onset right-sided chest pain and dyspnea. Diagnostic workup with positive D-dimer and CTPA confirmed acute pulmonary embolism. Mr. Johnson will be managed with anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring given his past medical history and current presentation.    Plan: The patient was admitted to ICU for close monitoring and was started on IV heparin. Consultation with a pulmonologist was sought for further management. The patient was also advised to incorporate moderate exercise into his routine and get regular health check-ups. He was also counselled regarding the signs and symptoms of PE recurrence and advised to seek emergency care in case of worsening or new symptoms.  This case represents the literature demographic of pulmonary embolism patients  often a history of DVT and comorbid conditions that increase risk. Additionally  this case highlights the importance of understanding patient symptoms and obtaining a complete patient history. This helps in early diagnosis which in turn improves the patient's outcome.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 63-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with an onset of sudden chest pain  difficulty in breathing  and a feeling of light-headedness. He had been managing hypertension and type 2 diabetes over the last ten years and they were generally well-controlled by Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. Mr. Rodriguez is a retired automotive worker and lives with his wife. He quit smoking 15 years ago but had been a heavy smoker for 25 years before that. He also admits to regular alcohol consumption although it is moderate. His father died of stroke at age 75 and his mother died of breast cancer at 79.  Clinical Findings:  The patient’s vitals were somewhat stable with blood pressure - 152/86mmHg  heart rate - 88 bpm  respiratory rate - 22 breaths/minute  SpO2 - 90% on room air which improved with supplemental oxygen  and body temperature - 98.4°F. His body mass index (BMI) indicated obesity (32.5 kg/m2). Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds  tachycardia  and accentuated second heart sound. CBC and metabolic panel were within normal limits. His D-Dimer level was elevated. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia.   Treatment  Outcome  and Follow-up:  Given his clinical presentation  the initial likely diagnoses were acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  acute coronary syndrome  and pneumothorax. A CTA chest confirmed a large clot burden in both pulmonary arteries indicating acute PE. Mr. Rodriguez was immediately started on Heparin infusion per acute PE protocol and admitted to the ICU for monitored care. He was later transitioned to oral Apixaban.  Overall  Mr. Rodriguez's condition improved noticeably within a few days of hospitalization and he was discharged with prescriptions for Apixaban  his routine Lisinopril and Metformin  and a new prescription for a statin to manage any potential dyslipidemia. At his follow-up appointment a week later  his symptoms had improved considerably and he reported more energy and less pain. He was advised on dietary modifications  regular exercise  regular monitoring of his blood sugar levels  and modulating alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of further health complications and recurring PE.  Conclusion:  Early diagnosis and immediate anticoagulant therapy proved lifesaving for Mr. Rodriguez. His case shows the necessity of thorough clinical examination and diagnostics in older patients  especially those with multiple risk factors like smoking history  obesity  hypertension  and diabetes  to manage potentially catastrophic conditions such as PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,61,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Allen is a 60-year-old African-American male  a retired truck driver  who arrived at the ER department at night complaining of sudden chest pain and shortness of breath  which started a few hours earlier. He has a significant history of smoking  approximately two packs of cigarettes daily for over 30 years. He also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He also has a sedentary lifestyle and is overweight with a BMI of 31.   History:  Given his symptoms that include chest pain  shortness of breath and tachypnea  diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered. He mentioned that he had been immobile on a long drive across the country for a family event  which could predispose him to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and possible subsequent PE. His social history reveals he is divorced and lives alone. His father passed away in his early 60s from a stroke and his mother died from breast cancer.  Clinical Examination:  Upon arrival at the hospital  his blood pressure was 155/85 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Physical examination revealed that the patient was anxious  perspiring profusely  and had cyanotic lips.   Diagnosis and Treatment:  His EKG shows sinus tachycardia. Emergency CT pulmonary angiogram was done which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The patient was started on anticoagulation medication immediately. The decision of starting thrombolytic therapy was withheld considering its risk/benefit ratio. Particularly since the patient displayed no signs of hemodynamic instability or altered mental status indicating possible early right ventricular failure  the standard anticoagulation approach is deemed appropriate.  Conclusion:  This patient's history of prolonged immobility  smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and being overweight contributed to the formation of a clot and subsequent acute PE. The case highlights the need for early recognition of signs and symptoms of PE  risk factor modification and early utilization of anticoagulation therapy.   In an acute setting  the case also spotlights the importance of taking comprehensive patient history  performing thorough physical examination and conducting appropriate diagnostic studies which are pivotal for diagnosis and management of acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism. The clinicians need to educate the patients about the risks of prolonged immobility and the importance of regular mobilization  healthy food habits and risks of smoking  in the prevention of such acute life-threatening conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,62,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male who was brought into the emergency department with severe shortness of breath that started abruptly earlier in the day. He also complained of sharp  localized chest pain that worsened upon deep inspiration  and a nagging cough. The patient's heart rate was elevated at 110 beats per minute (tachycardia)  and his oxygen saturation level was below the desired value at 88% on room air  prompting the immediate use of supplemental oxygen therapy.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and is on routine medication. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago. He had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago and has been on secondary preventive measures. He admits to maintaining a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet habits despite awareness of his health conditions. He quit smoking 15 years ago but has a total history of 20 pack years.  Family History:  The patient's father had a stroke at the age of 70. His mother passed away due to complications related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has two siblings  one of whom has high cholesterol levels  and the other one is healthy.  Emergency Department Evaluation:  Given the symptoms  the history of cardiovascular disease and sedentary lifestyle  the vascular team was alerted immediately. After initial evaluation  the patient underwent a D-dimer test  which was significantly elevated. Confirmation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was made by a helical CT scan  revealing the presence of a thrombus in the pulmonary artery.  Conclusion:  The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism  probably resulting from his overall sedentary lifestyle  personal medical history  and a genetic predisposition due to his family medical history. His treatment was initiated promptly with anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department. As per the literature  African American men have a higher incidence of PE  indicating a demographic disparity possibly related to genetic factors or health disparities in preventative care. The patient will be closely monitored and educated about the need for regular exercise  healthy eating  and medication adherence in the future to prevent recurrence. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,63,Patient Profile:   The patient under discussion is Mr. Phillips  a 63-year-old African American male. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) occurs relatively equal among ethnicities  and its incidence does not show significant differences between genders. However  the incidence of APE increases significantly with age  which is usually over 60 years old.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Phillips was brought to the emergency room complaining of chest pain that started suddenly about two hours ago. He also had experienced shortness of breath and light-headedness. He denied any cough  fever or recent travel history. His symptoms were suggestive of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.

He has a 15-year history of smoking  but had quit ten years ago. He also had a sedentary lifestyle. He had no surgical history.  Medication History:  Mr. Phillips is on Metformin (500mg  twice daily)  Lisinopril (10mg  once daily)  and Aspirin (75mg  once daily). He reported no allergies to any medications.  Family History:  Mr. Phillips shared that his father had suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother had hypertension and Type II diabetes. Both parents are deceased. He has two siblings: one sister  who has Type II diabetes and a brother who is healthy.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis:  On arrival  his vitals were BP: 155/95  HR: 110/min  RR: 20/min  and Temp: 98.2 F. SPO2 at room air was 92%. Physical examination showed mild central cyanosis and tachypnea. Laboratory investigations revealed raised D-dimer levels. His EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray was normal. Due to his raised D-dimer and suggestive symptoms  a CT Pulmonary Angiography was done  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion:  Mr. Phillips  is a 63-year-old African American male patient who presented with a sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and slight light-headedness. He has a past medical history of hypertension  diabetes and was an ex-smoker. His family history is pertinent concerning his father's myocardial infarction and mother’s hypertension and diabetes. His symptoms and the CT Pulmonary Angiography confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Extra care and consideration need to be given due to his underlying chronic conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,64,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Janet Martínez  a 62-year-old Hispanic female  presented to the emergency department with a main complaint of sudden onset difficulty in breathing and chest discomfort which had started approximately five hours prior. She describes her pain as 'sharp' and 'central ' making it very difficult to breathe deeply. It wasn't provoked by any physical exertion and wasn't relieved by resting. She also mentioned feeling lightheaded and sweaty.  History:  Mrs. Martínez has a significant past medical history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes  both controlled with prescribed medications. She has been a non-smoker for the past 15 years  previously smoked one pack a day for about 20 years. She maintains a sedentary lifestyle due to her work as a receptionist at a local clinic. She reports no history of associated symptoms such as cough  fever  or weight loss.  Four weeks ago  Mrs. Martínez underwent an elective right total knee arthroplasty due to her chronic osteoarthritis  after which she was mostly bedridden. A week prior to her visit  she began to experience swelling  redness  and tenderness in her right calf but she assumed this was post-operative and did not seek medical attention.  Family History:  Mrs. Martínez's father died at age 70 due to a heart attack  while her mother  age 85  is alive with a history of stroke. She has two siblings; an older brother diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and a younger sister with no major health issues.  Examination and Diagnosis:  On examination  Mrs. Martínez was in acute distress with respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Her heart rate was noted to be tachycardic at 110 beats per minute. The rest of her physical examination was generally unremarkable other than tenderness and swelling noted in the right calf. A D-Dimer test was highly positive.  A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed promptly  revealing a clot in the right pulmonary artery. Due to her recent surgery  sudden onset of symptoms  a positive D-Dimer test and findings on the CT scan  Mrs. Martínez was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate treatment was started with anticoagulation therapy.  Discussion:  This case underscores the fact that post-operative patients  particularly those undergoing orthopedic procedures  are at high risk for DVT and subsequent Pulmonary Embolism. An early diagnosis and immediate treatment can prevent morbidity and mortality. Also  patients' education regarding post-operative symptoms of DVT and PE can play a significant role in early detection.  
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,65,Patient Information: Mr. T is a 65-year-old Caucasian man  who is a retired engineer  residing in Lincoln  Nebraska. He is a nonsmoker and his alcohol use is social. His history reveals no allergic tendencies to food or medication. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father passing away from a heart attack at the age of 70 and his elder brother being diagnosed with hypertension.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. T reported to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of difficulty in breathing  chest pain  and feeling lightheaded which started 5 hours prior to presentation.  Medical History: Mr. T has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a prolonged period of immobility after a hip replacement surgery 2 years ago. He was also diagnosed with Hypertension 10 years ago  which is managed with Amlodipine 5mg daily. His BMI indicates he is overweight.  Clinical Findings: Clinical examination reveals tachycardia  tachypnea  and a slightly elevated blood pressure (BP 145/92). Oxygen saturation (SPO2) was found to be slightly reduced. There were no significant findings noted on systemic examination  including the absence of limb swelling or tenderness  which would otherwise suggest a recent DVT.  Investigations: An Electrocardiogram showed signs of S1Q3T3 pattern suggesting acute right heart strain. D-dimer test was significantly elevated. Due to the clinical suspicion of a pulmonary embolism  a Computerized Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) was ordered which revealed filling defects in the bilateral pulmonary arteries confirming a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: Mr. T was commenced on intravenous Heparin and admitted to the medical ward for close observation and further management. A referral was made to the Anticoagulation Clinic for consideration of long-term anticoagulation therapy  given his past medical history of DVT and now PE.  Patient Education and Follow-up: The importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modification  including diet and regular exercise  was emphasized to prevent recurrence. Outpatient follow-up  via telemedicine  was also scheduled in two weeks to evaluate Mr. T's response to therapy.  Conclusion: In conclusion  this case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute dyspnea and a history of previous deep vein thrombosis. Early recognition and prompt initiation of therapy is crucial to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with this potentially life-threatening condition.

Presenting Complaint: - Mr. Brown visited the emergency department with complaints of acute onset breathlessness  chest pain  coughing up blood  and dizziness that started earlier the same day.   Family History: - Father passed away due to a stroke in his late 70s - Mother  still alive  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes   Physical Examination: - Tachycardic (Heart Rate at 105 /min)  - Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air - Blood Pressure: 145/95 mmHg  Diagnostic Test Results: - ABG: Mild hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis - ECG: Sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern - CT pulmonary angiography: Showed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery - D-dimer test positive  Diagnoses: - Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Clinical Considerations: Given the history of DVT  present symptoms and diagnostic results  Mr. Brown was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. He presents several risk factors such as age  history of deep vein thrombosis  and a significant history of smoking.  Treatment Plan: Mr. Brown was started on anticoagulant therapy. His hypertension needs to be managed. A pulmonologist and a cardiologist will monitor him closely given the severity of his embolism.   Preventive Measures: Mr. Brown would need to adhere strictly to the medication regime  quit smoking  and adopt a healthier lifestyle. His family history of stroke and diabetes also suggests that lifestyle modifications will be beneficial for primary prevention of these conditions.  This confirms the need for acute intervention and long-term management strategy to prevent another episode of PE in the future. Monitoring effectiveness and side effects of the treatment  while incorporating lifestyle changes  should be stressed in follow-up consultations. The case also underscores the importance of patient education to ensure adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications.   Concluding Remarks: Mr. Brown's case is a typical example of an acute pulmonary embolism condition  which is common in the African American population with a history of smoking  hypertension  and previous occurrences of DVT. His case emphasizes the need for vigilant monitoring and adherence to treatment plans  as well as the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits to minimize the recurrence of such episodes. This case demonstrates the need for interdisciplinary care involving an emergency physician  pulmonologist  and cardiologist.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,67,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Williams is a 45-year-old African American male  who works long hours as a lawyer and leads a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. He presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and faintness. The chest pain was sharp  localized at the center and aggravated by deep breathing. There were also concerns about light-headedness  but no reports of cough  hemoptysis  or leg swelling.   Past Medical History:  His medical history is notable for hypertension and obesity  both diagnosed five years ago. There is no history of surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. He has a 15 pack-years history of smoking but quit 2 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially  and denies any illicit drugs use. He takes Lisinopril for his hypertension. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History:  His mother had a stroke at the age of 73  and his father suffers from coronary artery disease and hypertension. He has one younger sister who is healthy  and an older brother who has Type II diabetes and obesity. There are no known genetic or hereditary diseases in the family.  Clinical Findings:   On physical examination  Mr. Williams had a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  heart rate of 105 bpm  oxygen saturation of 92% while breathing room air  and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. His BMI is calculated as 32 (Obese class I). There were no leg signs of deep venous thrombosis.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given Mr. Williams' presenting symptoms  a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed which confirmed the presence of pulmonary embolism. He had elevated cardiac biomarkers (Troponin) and his D-dimer level was also high. EKG showed sinus tachycardia without signs of right strain.   Case Discussion:  This is a case of a patient who is at high risk of pulmonary embolism due to his sedentary lifestyle  obesity and history of smoking. It underlines the importance of considering a diagnosis of PE in patients with sudden  unexplained dyspnea  particularly those with risk factors. The African American population tends to have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  including PE  compared to Caucasians  as observed in various studies. Genetic propensity  lifestyle factors like lower levels of physical activity  higher BMI  and a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions (e.g.  hypertension and obesity) may contribute to this higher risk.  Prompt initiation of anticoagulation was essential for our patient  which he responded to satisfactorily.  The treatment goals are preventing clot propagation and new thrombus formation  reducing PE-related death  and preventing recurrent VTE. Long-term goals include prevention of complications and improvement of his overall health. This case emphasizes the significance of shared decision-making  as the patient's views will count in deciding about lifestyle changes and the intensity and duration of anticoagulation treatments.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,68,Patient Profile: Ms. P  a 66-year-old African-American woman  came to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing. She is a retired nurse  lives alone  and is widowed for five years. She's a non-smoker and non-alcoholic and has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: Ms. P has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and deep vein thrombosis five years ago. She also underwent total knee replacement three months ago due to her chronic osteoarthritis. She has been on an oral anticoagulant (warfarin) for the past five years.  Family History: Her father died at 67 years of knee cancer  and her mother died at 72 years of stroke. She has two healthy siblings. There are no known genetic diseases in the family  but her mother suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia in her later years.  Recent Developments: Ms. P reported that for the past week  she has been experiencing unusual fatigue  mild fever  cough with minimal expectoration. Moreover  her edema in the legs has been worse than usual  especially in the right leg. The chest pain started suddenly on the day of her visit to the hospital  accompanied by difficulty breathing which became progressively worse.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  she was found with tachycardia  tachypnea  and her blood pressure was slightly elevated. Auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds in the lower right lung field. Her right lower leg was slightly warmer than her left  and mild pitting edema was noted.  Investigation: Her blood reports showed a slightly elevated D-dimer level. An ECG was performed  showed S1Q3T3 pattern suggesting right heart strain. A CT pulmonary angiography was ordered which confirmed an acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: Given her history  current clinical and imaging findings  Ms. P was immediately started on intravenous heparin for initial rapid anticoagulation  then transitioned to apixaban.   Summary: Ms. P  a 66-year–old African–American female with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and deep vein thrombosis  recently diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. The risk factors include her past personal history of DVT  recent orthopedic surgery  and her race as African-American women over 60 are noted to have higher rates of venous thromboembolism risk.  This case emphasizes the vital need to consider pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with sudden onset chest pain and breathlessness  even with known cardiac risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia  especially when there is a personal history of DVT.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,69,Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mr. Diaz  a 64-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department complaining of severe shortness of breath starting approximately two hours prior to arrival. He reported experiencing earlier episodes of breathlessness  especially with exertion  over the past three weeks. He also mentioned experiencing new-onset intermittent chest pain that worsened upon deep breathing. He has been feeling more fatigued than usual and noticed recent unexplained weight loss.   Medical History: Mr. Diaz has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin and lisinopril. He currently takes aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. He is an ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago  after a 20-year history of about one pack of cigarettes a day. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  Family History: There's a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 67  and his mother had a stroke at 70. He has one brother with coronary artery disease  diagnosed at age 55.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Diaz was mildly distressed  with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 100 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation at 92% while breathing room air. On auscultation  his lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base.  Diagnosis and Investigations: Given the patient's symptoms  medical history  and physical examination findings  a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered. Confirmation of the PE was obtained via a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) that showed multiple pulmonary emboli in both lungs with the most significant one in the right lower lobe. His D-dimer level was elevated at 1250 ng/mL. An echocardiography showed right ventricular dilatation  which is an indicator of significant pulmonary embolism.  Management Plan: He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and was administered low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) based upon the size and extent of his pulmonary emboli. He was also started on oxygen supplement and fluid management. His diabetes and hypertension medications were continued  and cardiology was consulted for his management.  Plan for follow-up involves serial clinical assessment  checking relevant blood work  such as CBC  electrolytes  and kidney function. Anticoagulation maintenance with warfarin will be initiated  overlapping with LMWH for at least five days. The importance of adherence to anticoagulation therapy and regular follow-ups was emphasized to the patient.    This hypothetical representation aims to accommodate common demographics encounters in clinical practice  based on the aging US population and increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension  and diabetes in the Hispanic population. It also highlights the common risk factors for PE  including advanced age and existing cardiovascular diseases.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,70,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anderson  a 62-year-old African American male  presented himself to the emergency room with complaints of increasing shortness of breath and sharp  localized chest pain that seemed to exacerbate with each deep breath. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both conditions being controlled with prescribed medication. He admitted to have a 40-pack-year smoking history but has quit for the past decade. He has been leading a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement  but doesn't have a significant history of alcohol or substance abuse.  In terms of family medical history  both of his parents died due to cardio-related problems  specifically due to chronic heart disease at ages 65 and 72. His sister  aged 59  is currently living with congestive heart failure.   On evaluation  his vital signs were notable for tachycardia at 110 bpm  oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  a blood pressure reading of 142/85 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Physical examination showed reduced breath sounds in the left lower lobe  but no superficial vein thrombosis could be detected. No other sign of peripheral edema was observed.  Given Mr. Anderson's symptoms and initial assessment  a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a large clot in the left pulmonary artery  a clear indication of acute pulmonary embolism.  A series of laboratory tests were performed  showing an elevated D-dimer level of 0.75 mg/L and Troponin T level of 0.08 ng/mL. The arterial blood gas test showed a pO2 of 70 mmHg and pCO2 of 35 mmHg.  His hemoglobin A1c was 7.2%  indicating his diabetes was controlled.  In conclusion  Mr. Anderson was subsequently diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. His sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and family history of cardiovascular diseases contributed to his predisposition to develop this condition. He will now need further management and lifestyle changes to overcome this life-threatening situation.   Please note that while the above demographic and medical history is based on a fictional patient  the scenario presented is a representative case of acute pulmonary embolism consistent with common demographic and health trends in the literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,71,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient lives in a suburban area with her husband  has a BMI of 32 (indicating obesity)  has a history of alcohol consumption  and is a smoker  with a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of bilateral total knee replacement surgery six weeks ago. Post-surgery  she was immobilized for a prolonged period  which might have increased her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has also been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for the past ten years  which is under control with insulin administrations. She has a history of hypertension but no known history of cardiovascular diseases.  Family History:  The patient has a family history of blood clotting disorders  with her father having suffered from pulmonary embolism and her brother having a history of DVT. Her mother is alive and well at age 82  with no significant medical history.  Clinical Presentation:  Vitals on presentation are: BP: 140/90 mmHg  HR: 120 beats per minute  RR: 22 breaths per minute  SpO2: 92% on room air  indicating respiratory distress. The patient looked anxious  pale  and diaphoretic. Physical examination revealed tachycardia and tachypnea. The lungs showed decreased breath sounds on the right side. Lower extremity examination was significant for mild edema without any sign of deep vein thrombosis.  Investigations:  Chest X-ray was normal  ruling out any other causes of acute chest pain. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. A D-dimer test was immediately taken  which revealed a highly elevated level  indicating PE. A contrast-enhanced chest CT scan confirmed a large pulmonary embolism in the right lung.  Treatment:  Immediate anticoagulation therapy was initiated with intravenous heparin. Thrombolytic therapy was started after ruling out contraindications. Her symptoms improved with treatment.  This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing post-surgical immobility  family history  smoking  and obesity as risk factors for pulmonary embolism. The patient's acute onset of symptoms with a background of these risk factors should raise suspicion of a PE. This case also emphasizes the need for strict prophylaxis rules in postoperative patients.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,72,"Patient Presentation:   The patient  Mr. Dawson  is a 53-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department with abrupt onset shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain  usually worsening with deep breaths. Other symptoms include a dry cough  light-headedness  and sweatiness. Mr. Dawson is a non-smoker but has a sedentary lifestyle due to his profession as an IT manager.   Past medical history:   Mr. Dawson has been diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension) for the last 12 years  and he has been on medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily). He is also obese with a BMI of 32  height of 5'11""""  and weighs about 220 lbs. He was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago and takes Metformin 500mg twice daily. There is no history of surgeries  allergies  or any significant pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.  Family history:   Mr. Dawson reported a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away from a heart attack at the relatively young age of 62  and his mother suffered a stroke at 70 but survived. His older brother  56  also has hypertension and type II Diabetes Mellitus.  Clinical examination:  Upon physical examination  Mr. Dawson was in apparent distress  with respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  heart rate 105 beats per minute  blood pressure 148/95 mmHg  body temperature 36.8 °C (normal)  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Mild pitting edema was noticed in both lower extremities  chest was clear to auscultation  and heart rhythm was regular without murmurs. D-dimer level was significantly elevated at 0.85 µg/mL (normal range < 0.5 µg/mL).   Diagnostic Imaging:  A computerized tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was then carried out  which confirmed the presence of multiple emboli in the segmental and subsegmental branches of both lungs  thereby leading to a diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Discussion:  Acute pulmonary embolism is a common and sometimes fatal disease with an incidence of 70-90 cases per 100 000 population in African Americans. Risk factors include age  obesity  immobility  surgery  malignancy  pregnancy and puerperium  oral contraceptives  hormone replacement therapy  and blood disorders  especially those causing a hypercoagulable state. In Mr. Dawson’s case  his risk factors include obesity  hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  a sedentary lifestyle  and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.  Treatment plan:  The current plan is to initiate anticoagulant therapy with parenteral heparin followed by oral warfarin. In addition  lifestyle modifications will be advised to Mr. Dawson  including increased physical exercise  weight reduction  and improving dietary patterns.  As Mr. Dawson has multiple comorbidities  the multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist  endocrinologist  dietitian  and physiotherapist should be involved in his care. Regular follow-ups will be needed to monitor his response to treatment and ensure he is taking his medications properly for his various conditions."

He lives alone and usually consumes alcohol 3-4 times a week.   Presenting vital signs:  At presentation  his Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  Pulse was 102 beats/minute  Respiratory rate was 25 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation was at 90% on room air.  Investigations:  CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a filling defect in the left lower lobar artery  consistent with pulmonary embolism. Further lab results included D-dimer of 700 ng/mL (Normal: <500 ng/mL)  Troponin I: 0.3 ng/mL (Normal: <0.1 ng/mL)  and a mildly elevated BNP: 350 pg/mL (Normal: <100 pg/mL)  suggesting right heart strain.  Impression and Plan:  The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism possibly secondary to his long sedentary job  smoking  and family history. After stabilization with supplemental oxygen  he was given an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin  followed by a continuous infusion under close monitoring. After stabilization  he is planned to be transitioned to oral anticoagulation therapy. Further counselling concerning lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  regular exercise  better control of diabetes and hypertension  and cutting down on alcohol is also planned.  Discharge:  Upon discharge  Mr. Doe will continue on oral anticoagulants and will monitor his PT/INR levels regularly. He will regularly follow up with his primary care physician and his pulmonologist. He will be educated on the signs of a recurrent PE and will be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.  In summary  Mr. Doe's case is a reminder of the importance of considering PE in patients who present with sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain  especially in those with risk factors such as prior history of venous thrombosis  sedentary lifestyle  co-morbidities  smoking  and family history of PE or DVT.  The case also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modifications in the prevention of PE  timely recognition of symptoms and seeking immediate medical help if such symptoms occur.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,74,Patient Presentation:   Ms. L  a 54-year-old African American woman  is brought into the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. She has a history of chronic obesity  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes.   Past Medical History:  Ms. L was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 42 and has been managing it with oral hypoglycemics and lifestyle changes. Ms. L has been on hypertensive medications for the past six years. Her hypertension is moderately controlled  although she sometimes skips her medication due to side effects.  Meanwhile  she has a BMI of 33 indicating obesity and has struggled with weight loss throughout her life. She has no known allergies. Her only surgery was a C-section twenty years ago.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Both her parents passed away due to cardiac-related problems. Her mother suffered from recurrent DVTs  which suggest a potential genetic predisposition towards coagulation disorders. Her only sibling  a brother  was recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.  Social History:  Ms. L is a schoolteacher  a non-smoker  and only consumes alcohol socially. Because of her demanding work schedule  she leads an almost sedentary lifestyle and often resorts to easy  fast-food options. She lives with her daughter who is a college student.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  she appeared in acute distress with dyspnea. Her vitals revealed tachycardia and tachypnea - heart rate 115 bpm  respiratory rate 26/min. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/95 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.  Lab results showed D-dimer elevation and her CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. EKG suggested right heart strain  which presented a severe form of the disease.  Treatment Plan:  Ms. L was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin and she showed gradual improvement in her symptoms. She was advised for a hospital stay for monitoring of therapeutic anticoagulation. Also  discussions were held regarding dietary modifications and a structured plan for losing weight  to reduce her overall cardiovascular risk.   The pulmonary embolism in this patient was most likely precipitated by her chronic conditions  and lifestyle habits along with a potential genetic predisposition. This case highlights the need for vigilance and proactive management of such chronic conditions considering associated risk factors.

Impression: Based on his clinical presentation  risk factors  and family history  a preliminary diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was made.   Investigations: Lab results highlighted a modest increase in the D-dimer level. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia  and a chest X-ray was normal. The definitive diagnosis was made by conducting a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)  which revealed a large clot in the left pulmonary artery.   Management: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy (low-molecular-weight heparin)  oxygen supplementation  and supportive care. His condition stabilized over the next few days  and he was shifted to oral anticoagulants for long-term management of PE before discharge.   Follow-up: Mr. X has been advised to follow up regularly with the pulmonology clinic for monitoring his health and possible adjustment of his oral anticoagulants. He was also referred to a dietician and physiotherapist with a focus on weight management  increasing physical activity  and encouraging healthier lifestyle habits.   In conclusion  Mr. X's case reiterates the importance of recognizing the risk factors and early signs of PE to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment. Being more vigilant about such cases can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,76,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jones  a 73-year-old African American woman  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain aggravated by deep inspiration  and mild hemoptysis. Ms. Jones reported a history of progressive dyspnea over the past several days. She reports experiencing frequent malaise and fatigue  with no associated fevers  cough  or recent travel.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Jones suffered from chronic atrial fibrillation  for which she has been taking warfarin. She also has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus under control with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents. She has been relatively sedentary lately due to arthritis  but no history of any surgical intervention. She reports medication compliance but has not had an INR level checked in several months. No previous history of venous thromboembolic disease.  Family History:  There's a significant family history as her father died of a stroke  and her mother had a myocardial infarction in her late 80's. No family history reported of venous thromboembolic disease.  Social History:  The patient lives with her elder daughter. She is a widow  is not a tobacco smoker  denies illicit drug use  and reports occasional alcohol use.  In the ED:  Upon examination  she was distressed and diaphoretic with increased respiratory rate of 30/min and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Her blood pressure was 136/82 mmHg and heart rate was irregularly irregular at 98 bpm. On examination  she had mild bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities but no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Upon auscultation  there were bibasilar rales in lungs.  Diagnostic Studies:  Her elevated D-dimer levels and electrocardiogram showing signs of right ventricle strain prompted a computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  revealing bilateral pulmonary emboli. Echocardiography confirmed right ventricle strain with mildly impaired function. Her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2.  Plan:  Ms. Jones was admitted to the hospital and initiated appropriate anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging to warfarin. She responded well to the treatment regarding her symptoms. Her oxygen status also improved steadily.    Diagnosis:  Based on the assessments and tests  Ms. Jones was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Teaching Points:  This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining therapeutic INR level in patients with atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. Pulmonary embolism should be suspected in case of sudden onset dypsnea particularly in high-risk patients  including those with a history of immobilization  cancer  or thrombophilic conditions  as well as elderly patients  and African Americans who are found to have higher odds of venous thromboembolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,77,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  an accountant  with a prior medical history of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) nearly six months ago  managed with anticoagulants until three months ago. He smokes a half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years  relatively sedentary due to the nature of his work. He denies alcohol use or illicit substance use. His father died in his 60s from a stroke  and his mother has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Two days prior to being seen  the patient noted acute shortness of breath on minimal exertion  associated with sharp rightsided chest pain which was worse on inspiration. He also mentioned feeling faint with episodes of light-headedness. He reported no fever  recent travel  reduced mobility  surgery  trauma  or known malignancy  and no symptoms suggesting active DVT. He has never been on a long flight journey lately.  Physical examination revealed the patient's heart rate of 120 BPM  blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg  respiration rate of 24 per minute  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Notably  there were no signs of DVT. His hematology and biochemistry test results were within the normal range apart from a slightly elevated D-dimer. Due to his symptoms  history of DVT  and cigarette smoking  a decision was made to perform a CT pulmonary angiography after seeing his slightly high D-dimer level.  The CT pulmonary angiography revealed acute pulmonary emboli in the right pulmonary artery extending to segmental branches. He was consequently hospitalized for treatment and management of his acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE).  Considering his history of DVT and now PE  a final diagnosis of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VT) was made. Patient care included hospital admission for intravenous anticoagulation therapy with heparin was initiated immediately. Upon stabilization  the patient was transitioned to oral apixaban thereafter. Patient education was provided on the importance of medication compliance and follow-up appointments. Smoking cessation was also strongly stressed.  Lifestyle modifications were also advised to increase daily physical activity and reduce prolonged sitting. The patient was advised to return immediately if any recurrence of chest pain  shortness of breath  or other concerning symptoms occurred.   In this case  the high index of suspicion and early intervention proved pivotal in the patient’s prognosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,78,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. Jacobs Age: 55 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Mr. Jacobs  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital after reporting symptoms of sudden chest pain  dyspnea  and syncope. After further examination and diagnostic testing  he was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jacobs has a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  obesity (BMI 33.5 kg/m²)  and high serum cholesterol. Approximately two years ago  he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He reports a chronic heavy smoking habit (30-pack year history) and minimal physical activity.  Family History: Both his father and paternal uncle had myocardial infarctions in their early fifties  implying a possible genetic predisposition to cardiovacular diseases. His mother has a history of deep vein thrombosis  which suggests a family history of coagulative disorders.   Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Jacobs presented with acute  unilateral chest pain  which he rates as 8/10 on a visual analog scale. Other symptoms include shortness of breath  lightheadedness and feelings of anxiety. Mr. Jacobs also reported haemoptysis (coughing of blood)  which is a typical symptom of pulmonary embolism.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Jacobs was observed to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and had peripheral oxygen saturation of 90%. His blood pressure was elevated at 160/95 mmHg. He had tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds in the right lung base.  Laboratory and Imaging Results: A D-dimer test  which is a blood test that can rule out a thrombus  was significantly elevated. A CT angiography of the chest revealed a large right-sided pulmonary embolus.   Diagnosis: According to the clinical picture  the patient's symptoms  and the medical history  this patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  In conclusion  Mr. Jacobs’ history of hypertension  diabetes  obesity  and cardiovascular disorders  coupled with his lack of physical activity and heavy smoking history  have put him at significant risk for developing acute pulmonary embolism. His case should facilitate a discussion on early detection  lifestyle changes  and appropriate pharmacological intervention or thrombolysis. His family history of deep vein thrombosis should also be seen as a significant predictive factor.   With this in mind  Mr. Jacobs should be made aware of the serious nature of his condition  the importance of regular monitoring  medication adherence  and the critical role of lifestyle modifications. Appropriate management and genetic screening in the family should also be considered.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,79,Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male who works as a long-haul truck driver. His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type two diabetes. He is a lifetime non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and his height and weight indicate he is mildly overweight. His immediate family history includes a father who suffered a stroke at age 73 and a mother with diabetes. He has lived a generally sedentary lifestyle due to the nature of his job.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith was brought into the emergency department by his wife after he experienced a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness  initially dismissing the symptoms as fatigue. His symptoms worsened over the next 24 hours  with added difficulty in breathing. His wife also mentioned that he had recently undergone a surgery for hernia repair and had been largely inactive during the recovery period.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  Mr. Smith appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 93% while breathing ambient air. On auscultation  his lungs were bilaterally clear  and cardiovascular examination revealed an S1  S2 without any apparent murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Diagnostic Evaluation: A D-dimer test was performed due to suspicion of pulmonary embolism  which came back significantly elevated. A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the presence of multiple small emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. EKG showed signs of right heart strain indicating extensive lung involvement.  Management and Outcome: Mr. Smith was admitted to the hospital for further management. He was started on oxygen therapy and anticoagulant medication. Over the next couple of days  Mr. Smith's symptoms improved significantly  and he was discharged with a prescription for anticoagulant therapy and advised to follow a regular exercise regime to promote better blood circulation. He was also educated about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism and instructed to return to the ED if they recur.   Follow-ups were arranged with pulmonology and his primary care physician to manage his existing chronic conditions and monitor him post his acute medical situation. In the long-term management of his health  importance will be placed on regular physical activity and adhering to an appropriate diabetic diet. Regular follow-ups and adherence to anticoagulant therapy should limit any further risk of PE.  This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with increased risk  such as those with a recent history of surgery  reduced mobility  or chronic health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,80,Patient Information: Patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian woman named Mrs. Smith. She is married with two adult children. She is a retired school teacher and a non-smoker. She maintains a healthy diet but exercises less frequently due to her busy schedule. Her only known allergies are to shellfish and penicillin.  Chief Complaint: Sudden shortness of breath and sharp chest pain worsened by deep inhalation  which was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith has a past medical history of type-II diabetes mellitus  hypertension (both of which are well-controlled with medication)  and two episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has been taking oral contraceptives for menopausal symptom control for several years.  Family History: Mrs. Smith's father suffered from myocardial infarctions and her mother had a history of stroke. Recent loss of a close family member has caused significant mental and emotional stress.  Physical Examination: Patient was found to be in moderate distress due to the shortness of breath and chest pain. Her blood pressure was mildly elevated (140/90 mmHg) and her heart rate was 110 bpm  with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. No signs of lower limb swelling  or calf pain on dorsiflexion indicative of DVT were found.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Given the patient's medical history of DVTs  current use of oral contraceptives  and the presence of risk factors such as age  combined with the symptoms  a presumptive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was made. A D-dimer test was performed which returned positive. This was followed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirming the diagnosis of acute PE.  Treatment: Mrs. Smith was hospitalized and initiated on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an immediate course of action  and oral anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin was started. She was also counseled about the risk of long-term use of contraceptives and provided with alternative solutions for menopausal symptom management.   The patient's risk factor needs to be reassessed due to her family history of heart disease and stroke  combined with personal history of DVT and now PE. Patient teaching about medication adherence  symptom recognition  lifestyle modification  and regular follow up is crucial for Mrs. Smith.  This case represents an example of acute PE mainly driven by risk factors of oral contraceptives use  previous history of DVT  family history of cardiovascular diseases and potential sedentary behavior due to the recent familial loss. The importance of early diagnosis  timely investigation and management is highlighted in such acutely presenting conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,81,Patient Presentation:  I. Demographics:  Our patient is a 52-year-old Hispanic female named Maria  who is a single mother living with her two teenage children. She has a history of obesity and has been struggling with weight management for a couple of years. Maria is a high school teacher and leads a sedentary lifestyle. As a non-smoker  she rarely consumes alcohol and has not been exposed to any occupational hazards. Maria has no past record of any surgeries and reports no known allergies. The patient does have a family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father died of a heart attack at age 65  and her mother is living with hypertension.  II. Past Medical History:  Maria was previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus three years ago and Hypothyroidism five years ago. Both conditions have been managed with medication (Metformin and Levothyroxine respectively) and periodic follow-ups. Recently  she has experienced increased fatigue and occasional difficulty with breathing. Maria reports adherence to her medications but expresses concerns about her escalating shortness of breath.  III. Presenting Complaint:  Maria visited the emergency department with complaints of sudden shortness of breath and chest tightness. She also reported experiencing light-headedness  rapid heartbeat  and perspiration. She denied experiencing any cough  hemoptysis  or febrile symptoms.  IV. Physical Examination and Investigation:  On physical examination  she was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. Her blood pressure was 142/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. DVT was suspected  and ultrasonography of the lower limbs showed a clot in the left popliteal vein. Further assessment using a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the pulmonary embolism.  Lab results indicated elevated D-dimer levels and an abnormal INR. Her fasting blood glucose levels were found to be uncontrolled with a heightened HbA1c level. Other standard blood work including complete blood count  renal function  and electrolyte panels were within normal ranges.  V. Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism.  VI. Management and Prognosis:  Maria was administered low molecular weight heparin and was started on oral anticoagulation therapy. Patient education on the importance of medication adherence  weight loss  physical activity  and periodic controls for diabetes management was emphasized. She was also referred to endocrinology for better control of her diabetes and obesity  as these are the possible risk factors for her current diagnosis. Prognosis is currently uncertain  although with good adherence to the treatment plan  it can be considerably improved. Comprehensive follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her response to the treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,82,Patient Information:   Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African American male  presented with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath.  Medical History:   Past medical history reveals that Mr. Johnson has been living with chronic hypertension and obesity. He has a history of being a smoker but quit 10 years ago. He was involved in a recent accident and sustained a leg fracture  which necessitated bedrest and immobilization.  Demographics:  Recent studies suggest that Black men have higher acute pulmonary embolism rates compared to their White counterparts  making Mr. Johnson's demographic significant in his current health situation. Furthermore  his age  gender  and ethnicity increase his susceptibility to the disease.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson’s family medical history includes his father  who died at 72 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother  who has diabetes. His younger brother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 55.  Presenting Issues:  Mr. Johnson described a sharp  stabbing chest pain  worse with deep breaths. He also reported a progressive shortness of breath  which developed over the past two days along with feelings of anxiety and dizziness. He denied any other associated symptoms such as cough  fever  or recent illness.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic:  His vital signs showed tachypnea (respiratory rate 22/min)  tachycardia (heart rate 114 bpm)  and a borderline blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg. Lab work shows an elevated D-dimer level. Due to high clinical suspicion  a CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management:  Mr. Johnson was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. He was started on anticoagulants  with an initial dose of low molecular weight heparin and transitioned to oral anticoagulants for long term management.  This case represents a classic presentation of acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with multiple risk factors including age  ethnicity  immobilization due to a recent accident  and a family history of DVT. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of anticoagulant therapy are crucial to prevent further complications.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,83,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. Samuel Ortiz Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Location: Miami  Florida  Complaint: He came in complaining of sudden shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsened with deep breaths.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ortiz was diagnosed with type-II diabetes 12 years ago but has managed it well with medication and diet. No history of other chronic diseases. His last recorded BMI classifies him as overweight. He also has a 20-year history of tobacco use  having quit five years ago.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died of a heart attack at 74  and a younger brother recently diagnosed with hypertension. His mother  currently 87  has late-onset asthma.  Physical Examination: Patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic  with elevated heart rate of 112 bpm and blood pressure of 162/98 mmHg. Respiratory rate was slightly increased (24 breaths/min) and his SpO2 was 91% on room air.  Investigations: His ECG showed T wave inversions in the inferior lead. D-Dimer test was significantly elevated. Chest CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism in the right lung.  Treatment: He was promptly started on anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin followed by oral warfarin  aimed at preventing further clot formation.   Hospital Course: Despite initial stabilization  he had to be shifted to ICU due to persistent hypoxia and tachycardia. After five days of rigorous treatment and monitoring  Mr. Ortiz showed significant improvement.  Discussion: Pulmonary embolism is common among the elderly population and those with risk factors like prolonged immobility  recent surgery  active cancer  obesity  and lifestyle factors like smoking. Considering Mr. Ortiz's age  BMI  smoking history  and family history of cardiovascular diseases  he was at a higher risk.  Follow-up: Mr. Ortiz was counseled about his condition and the importance of medication adherence  regular check-ups  weight management  and adopting a healthy lifestyle. Regular follow-ups have been advised to monitor his anticoagulation therapy and to handle any potential complications.   Despite the initial scare  Mr. Ortiz is well on his path of recovery.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,84,Patient Presentation   A 56-year-old African American male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that started approximately three hours prior. The pain was diffuse  stabbing in nature  exacerbated by deep inhalation  and non-radiating. He rated his pain as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. He denied cough  fever  and hemoptysis but admitted to mild leg swelling. He had no known allergies and denied any recent travel  surgery  or prolonged immobilization.  Past Medical History   The patient had a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and was being followed up in the internal medicine clinic. He was on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril and Amlodipine for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.   Family History  His father died at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction and his mother was still alive  managed for hypertension and arthritis. He had three siblings; one had diabetes mellitus and the other two were healthy. There was no known family history of clotting disorders or malignancies.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient appeared anxious  with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  heart rate of 120 beats per minute  blood pressure of 145/94mmHg  O2 saturation of 90% on room air  and a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius (99°F). Chest examination showed decreased breath sounds on the left lower zone. His legs showed mild bilateral pitting edema more in the left than the right  but no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Investigations & Management  Initial labs showed a mildly raised D-dimer. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia. A chest X-ray was normal. Given the clinical suspicion of respiratory symptoms and raised D-dimer  a CT pulmonary angiography was done  which confirmed an acute pulmonary embolism.   The patient was started on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) and was admitted to the medical floor for further care. Thrombophilia workup was sent. Echocardiogram to evaluate for right heart strain and V/Q scan can be done for further evaluation if necessary. The patient and family were educated on the importance of medication compliance and regular follow-ups.   The teamwork of the healthcare professionals  coupled with the patient's and family's cooperation  were crucial to the successful management of this urgent situation. The case also underlines the importance of early recognition and immediate initiation of management for acute pulmonary embolism.    Though the presentation and management of pulmonary embolism might be similar across genders and races  the prognosis and response to treatment can be influenced by these factors. Studies suggest that African Americans have higher risk but a lower diagnosis rate for VTE compared to Caucasians. Thus  social and clinically relevant factors should be considered in managing such cases.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,85,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who presented to the emergency department with acute  sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. Previously  the patient did not report any respiratory complaints or a history of surgeries  trauma  or long-term immobility. He has no record of chronic ailments  such as hypertension  diabetes  or coronary artery disease. However  he has been a smoker for over 30 years and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his desk job.  In terms of family history  his father died of stroke at the age of 70  and his mother is still alive at 87 with no significant health problems except osteoarthritis. He has one older sister who recently was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. The patient himself has no history of blood clots  malignancies  chronic liver or kidney diseases.  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and was tachypneic  maintaining a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His heart rate hovered at 110 beats per minute  and his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation was decreased to 90% on room air.  Investigations:  Blood work reported an increase in D-dimers  which  along with the findings of clinical history and examination  raised high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). Further  a CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE. The emboli were present in the left lower lobar artery and the right upper lobar artery.  Management and Outcome:  He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to the severity of his symptoms. Anticoagulation was initiated immediately with intravenous heparin. Subsequently  oral administration of direct oral anticoagulants was scheduled for long-term management. Education around lifestyle modification  especially quitting smoking and increasing physical activity  was given. He was discharged after one week and has subsequent follow-up appointments planned in the outpatient department.  Discussion:  This case illustrates a typically high-risk demographic: a sedentary older adult who is a chronic smoker  suggesting a likelihood of underlying undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and a family history of thromboembolic disease. This demographic is congruent with the American Thoracic Society's findings that PE typically affects individuals aged 60-70 with one or more risk factors  including smoking  sedentary lifestyle  or a family history of the disease.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,86,"Patient Presentation:  Name: """"John Doe"""" Age: 55 years old Race: Caucasian Gender: Sex Occupation: Factory worker  mostly sedentary working style Location: Urban Midwest  USA  Past Medical History: """"John Doe"""" has a medical history of hypertension and obesity. At his recent annual check-up  his BMI was 31  suggesting he falls within class 1 obesity category. He has been prescribed medication for hypertension but admits to missing doses occasionally. He quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol casually twice a month. He has no recorded allergies.  Family History: His mother had deep vein thrombosis in her 50s  and his maternal uncle passed away in his early 60s due to a heart attack. No other significant hereditary conditions are noted.  Current Medical issue: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that had started an hour before presentation. The chest pain was sharp  9/10 in intensity  and worsened with deep inspiration. Also  he indicated he felt light-headed with episodes of dizziness.   Upon admission  his vital signs were reported as follows: BP -152/95  HR - 110 bpm  RR - 22 breaths/min  Temperature - 37.2°C (99°F)  and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.   Based on the patient's symptoms and potential risk factors for thrombotic diseases (obesity  past smoking history  family history)  a decision was made to further investigate for a potential acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Further Diagnostics/testing: EKG showed signs of right heart strain and D-dimer levels came back substantially increased. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of a clot in the patient's distal right pulmonary artery  confirming an acute PE diagnosis.  Management Plan Implemented: The patient was started on anticoagulant therapy immediately as per acute PE management guidelines. He remained hospitalized for observation and further management. Patient education was provided about lifestyle modification and importance of medication compliance.   Conclusion: This case presentation highlights the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with sudden chest pain and dyspnea  especially if they have identifiable risk factors like obesity and family history of thrombotic diseases.   (Take note that for a more detailed case study  the presentation should include more comprehensive data including laboratory results  imaging reports  details on anticoagulant therapy  and patient counseling methods.)"
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,87,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: A 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and obesity (BMI: 32.5) presents to the emergency room with complaints of acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness.  Clinical History: The patient reports the symptoms started suddenly earlier in the day while performing routine activities. His chest pain is pleuritic in nature and was aggravated by deep inspiration. He had no fever  cough  or hemoptysis. He is an ex-smoker with 20 pack-year smoking history and quit ten years ago. He mentions that he is sedentary due to his COPD. His medications include atenolol and tiotropium bromide but is otherwise not on anticoagulants or any over-the-counter medications.  Family History: His paternal side of the family has a history of heart disease and his father passed away at an early age due to myocardial infarction. There is no known history of genetic disorders or clotting disorders in the family.  Physical Examination: On examination  he was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26/min  heart rate of 110/min  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  oxygen saturation at 90% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed reduced breath sounds at the base of the right lung.  Investigations and Diagnosis: His EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right heart strain. D-dimer levels were markedly elevated. Subsequent Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment Procedure: He was managed with oxygen therapy and intravenous heparin was initiated immediately as anticoagulation therapy. His symptoms improved over the following days.  Discussion: Given his sedentary lifestyle due to COPD  obesity  and history of smoking  he had three significant risk factors for developing a venous thromboembolism. This case underscores that a high index of suspicion is needed in patients with risk factors and suggestive symptoms to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with acute pulmonary embolism. The patient was educated about the benefits of a healthier lifestyle to lose weight  eat healthily  and exercise regularly to minimize further risks. A multidisciplinary approach  including consultation with a dietician and physiotherapist  was suggested to help him in achieving this.   References:  Konstantinides  S. V.  Meyer  G.  Becattini  C.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,88,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The subject is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  James  domiciled in the midwestern United States. He is an accountant by profession and a smoker  with a 40-pack-year history. James further reported engaging in moderate alcohol consumption of about 2-3 bottles of beer per week. James is married  with five children  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to the demands of his job.  Past Medical History: James has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  for which he has been on medication for the past 10 years. His Body Mass Index (BMI) indicates he is overweight  with a measurement of 28. James reported regular monitoring of his blood pressure and blood glucose level. His last HbA1c  2 months ago  was 7.4%  despite being on Metformin and lifestyle modifications.  Family History: His parents are deceased; his mother died of a stroke  and his father died from a heart attack. His older brother is alive and has coronary artery disease  while his younger sister is diagnosed with breast cancer.  Presenting Problem: James came to the ER complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started about six hours previously while he was at home watching television. His wife observed that he was diaphoretic and his lips appeared bluish.  Clinical Examination & Other Investigations: On examination  there was tachycardia (heart rate of 112 beats per minute) and he had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. He was afebrile  Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. On auscultation  breath sounds were reduced in lower lobes bilaterally with mild crackles. The rest of the physical exam was non-contributory.  His blood tests showed an increased D-dimer level of 800 ng/mL (normal <500 ng/ml). Complete blood counts  electrolytes  kidney and liver function tests were all within the normal range. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia without any ST or T wave changes. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  Diagnosis: Based on the high-probability Wells' score  the sudden onset of his symptoms  his risk factors (such as age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking  and existing comorbid conditions)  clinical examination  and elevated D-dimer levels  a presumptive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made.  Management: James was started on high-flow oxygen therapy  intravenous fluids  and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. He was then admitted to the ICU for further investigations including CT pulmonary angiography and treatment  with cardiology and pulmonology consults placed for further management.  In conclusion  our patient is a representative case of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) whose risk factors are primarily sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and smoking which are consistently documented in epidemiological studies. The acute management plan focused on restoring vascular patency and decreasing the risk of further embolic events with anticoagulation. Further investigations would validate the preliminary diagnosis and elaborate management plans. His family history of cardiovascular diseases implies that he is at an increased risk of such incidents  emphasizing the role of preventative strategies in such patients.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,89,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Demographic Information: Mr. Santos  a 55-year-old African American male  was admitted to the hospital presenting signs of acute pulmonary embolism. He lives in Miami  Florida with his family  is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  and has a stable job as an office clerk which involves sedentary work.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are well under control with medication (Losartan 50mg daily and Metformin 1000mg twice daily  respectively). He tested positive for Factor V Leiden  a genetic disorder known to increase the risk for blood clots. Mr. Santos had a history of deep vein thrombosis in the lower leg two years ago.   Family History: Mr. Santos's parents both suffered from hypertension and his mother had a cerebrovascular stroke at the age of 65. His maternal uncle had a pulmonary embolism at an elderly age. There are no reports of any malignancies in the family.   Presenting Complaints: On admission  the patient complained of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. There were initial concerns of a possible cardiac event due to his diabetes and hypertension. However  further diagnostic workup and symptoms suggested that he was suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism.  Laboratory Findings & Diagnostics: Vitals on admission recorded a heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure at 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Blood tests showed: D-Dimer levels markedly high at 1500 ng/mL (normal range: 0-500 ng/mL) suggesting the possibility of a clot. His Troponin levels were slightly elevated at 0.05 ng/mL (normal: <0.03 ng/mL)  but his EKG did not indicate a myocardial infarction.  A Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a clot in the pulmonary artery. An ultrasound Doppler study of his lower limbs did not show any new instances of deep vein thrombosis.  The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism and was treated with thrombolytic therapy. He responded well to treatment and was discharged to his home with continued anticoagulant therapy (Warfarin)  given his personal and family history of thromboembolic events. He was advised on signs and symptoms of recurrence and was booked for frequent follow-ups for INR monitoring.   Given his lifestyle and Factor V Leiden positivity  the patient was counseled on necessary lifestyle changes (including increased exercise and regular leg movement during his office work hours)  and the potential implications of his genetic disorder. Consideration was also made to refer the patient for genetic counseling support  given the inheritable nature of Factor V Leiden.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,90,Patient Profile:  Mr. J  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  resident of Tucson  Arizona  presented to the hospital with acute dyspnea and chest pain which has lasted for two days. He is retired and is living with his spouse. He is an ex-smoker with a 20-year history of 1 pack/day which he quit 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both managed with relevant medications. He had a right knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago and confined to bed rest during the recovery period.   Family History: His mother died at the age of 78 due to myocardial infarction  and his father died at the age of 84 of stroke. His eldest brother  73  has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and his younger sister  68  suffers from rheumatoid arthritis.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his blood pressure was reported as 150/90 mmHg  heart rate was 110 bpm  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. O2 saturation was 92% on room air. On auscultation  breath sounds were decreased at the right lower lung field. The rest of the physical examination was mostly unremarkable. D-dimer test was positive.   Diagnosis: Due to the clinical picture  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered which revealed filling defects in both pulmonary arteries  confirming the diagnosis of acute bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Management: Mr. J was started immediately on intravenous heparin  and warfarin was initiated on the second day of hospitalization. His hypertension was managed with a slight adjustment of his home antihypertensive medication during the stay. Credentials of physiotherapy were suggested to prevent such immobilization incidents in the future.  Summary: Caucasian adults  especially men  have higher rates of venous thromboembolism  such as pulmonary embolism  as per the literature. Factors such as age  post-surgical status  immobilization  hypertension  and smoking history predispose Mr. J to an increased risk. The management of acute pulmonary embolism involves immediate anticoagulation therapy  treating underlying risk factors  and patient education for preventive measures.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,91,Patient Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian male retired architect  who was brought by his wife and son to the emergency room with complaints of sudden breathlessness  chest pain on inspiration  and feelings of lightheadedness. His wife noted a noticeable drop from his usual level of activity over the past two weeks. Few coughing episodes were noted  with some occasional light blood-streaked sputum  but no history of fever  weight loss  or night sweats.  Patient History and Demographics: The patient is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but with a 30 pack-year smoking history. He was diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago  controlled under regular monotherapy with amlodipine. He also has a known history of hyperlipidemia managed with statins  and a sedentary lifestyle. He has not been diagnosed previously with heart disease or diabetes mellitus. Furthermore  he has no known allergies or history of any major surgeries or hospitalizations. He leads a generally healthy lifestyle  no reported illicit drug use  or alcohol abuse. His parents are alive and well in their 90s  and there is no family history of venous thromboembolism  malignancy  or bleeding disorders.  Investigation and Diagnosis: Upon thorough examination  he was noted to be tachypneic  with oxygen saturation of 90% in room air. Heart sounds were normal  with tachycardia noticed. Blood analysis showed elevated D-Dimer levels  a hint towards the presence of clot fragmentation molecules. Pulmonary function tests were impaired  indicative of obstruction in the pulmonary vasculature. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with a clot observed in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. An electrocardiogram showed signs of right-heart strain and an ultrasound of the lower extremities identified a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right calf vein.  Conclusion: Acute pulmonary embolism was confirmed  which is thought to originate from a DVT. The patient  given his history of smoking and hypertension  was at a higher risk of developing this condition. It was decided to immediately start him on anticoagulant therapy to dissolve the clot and improve his symptoms. His case also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modification  smoking cessation  and regular cardiovascular health checkups  especially for those with known risk factors.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,92,Patient Case Presentation: Acne Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired industrial worker residing in Seattle  Washington  USA. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He is married with two grown-up children. He is from a lower middle-income class and has Medicare health insurance coverage.  Medical History: The patient has a known case of mild hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is well controlled with medication compliance. Apart from these conditions  he has a noted history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) six years ago  for which he underwent treatment and has been on anti-coagulant medications since then.  Presenting Issue: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset difficulty breathing  chest pain that worsened with deep breathing  and palpitation. These symptoms were accompanied by a slight cough and mild fever. No associated nausea  vomiting  or diarrhea. His oxygen saturation on room air was noted at 90% - below the normal range (95 -100 %) indicating inadequate oxygenation.  Family History: The patient's father had a history of heart disease and passed away from myocardial infarction. His mother has a history of rheumatoid arthritis. His elder sister is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer and his brother is healthy.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Given his symptoms and past medical history  CT pulmonary angiography was performed immediately  which showed a clot present in one of the main pulmonary arteries. A subsequent venous ultrasound showed residual chronic DVT in the left lower limb. Alongside imaging confirmations  laboratory tests  including a high D-dimer level  further supported the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Management: The patient was immediately started on parenteral anticoagulant therapy in the ER. Given his acute episode and risk factors  consultation with a pulmonologist and a vascular surgeon was sought for further intervention and management.   Plan:  The patient will be started on currently indicated direct oral anticoagulants and be followed closely on an outpatient basis by both the pulmonologist and vascular surgeon. Lifestyle modifications will be reinforced  including regular exercise  balanced diet  and regular screenings.  Overall  the case underscores the importance of ongoing medications  lifestyle modification  and constant monitoring in patients with chronic conditions such as DVT  especially when other risk factors such as age  hypertension  and diabetes mellitus co-exist.  Note: This presentation is a representation of a typical case and does not represent an actual patient. Furthermore  as patient care and treatment constantly evolve  certain aspects of this case may change with new clinical guidelines/practices. It is always essential to treat every patient on an individual basis  referencing the most current and evidenced-based guidelines and practices.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,93,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Smith Age: 74  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher   Case Presentation:  Mrs. Smith  a 74-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. She complained of sudden onset dyspnea  sharp chest pain exacerbated by deep breathing  light-headedness  palpitations  and acute cough with minimal blood-streaked sputum.   Past Medical History:  A look at her medical history revealed that the patient had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about six months ago  which was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation. Other significant past medical conditions include hypertension under control with medications  postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy  and a hip replacement surgery ten years ago.   Family History:  On inquiry about the family history  Mrs. Smith reported that her elder sister had a DVT episode at the age of 70. Her mother and father both had cardiovascular diseases  with her father dying of a heart attack at the age of 68 and her mother passing away from a stroke at the age of 79. There is no known genetic disorder in the family.  Social History:  Mrs. Smith  a retired school teacher  leads a sedentary lifestyle; her physical activity level is low  especially after her hip replacement surgery. She has no history of smoking or alcohol use. Her BMI is 31  making her classified as obese.  On examination  her blood pressure was 145/90 mm Hg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Pulmonary auscultation did not reveal any significant abnormalities. Cardiac examination showed tachycardia with no specific murmur. Her lower limb examination did not reveal any signs of DVT.   Based on her clinical presentation and history  she was highly suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer test was ordered  and results showed elevated levels. This was followed by a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)  which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.   The patient was administered a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  which will be continued until the initiation of oral anticoagulants.  This case depicts a typical representative of acute pulmonary embolism  considering her demographic group highlighted by literature; she is a Caucasian woman over the age of 70  sedentary lifestyle  history of DVT  and hormone replacement therapy  all of which are significant risk factors for pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,94,Patient Information:  A 64-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Anderson  presented to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath  chest discomfort  and cough with slight hemoptysis. He is a retired construction worker and a heavy smoker with a history of 35 pack-years and occasional alcohol use.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Anderson has a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He underwent a total knee replacement two weeks ago. For these conditions  he has been on long-term therapy with salbutamol inhaler  metformin  and lisinopril. His medication compliance is good but has ongoing difficulty quitting smoking.  Family History:  There is no reported family history of coagulative disorders but his father and two uncles developed coronary artery diseases and stroke in their late 60s; his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and his sister with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Clinical Findings:  On general examination  he was restless with an increased heart rate (110 beats per minute) and slightly elevated blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90% on room air.  Lab and Imaging:  The D-dimer test came back positive. EKG showed signs of right ventricular strain and troponin levels were slightly raised. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery.  Diagnosis:  With the clinical presentation  patient's history of recent surgery  heavy smoking  and CTPA findings  a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made.  Management:  The patient was promptly started on oxygen therapy  given his low SpO2 levels. He was also started on anticoagulation drugs. In view of the large size of the embolus  thrombolytic therapy was initiated.  Discussion:  Post-operative patients  particularly those who undergo orthopedic procedures like total knee replacement  have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism which can lead to acute pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs. Additional risk factors such as age  smoking  COPD  hypertension and diabetes further compound this risk. This case underscores the importance of effective prophylaxis measures in at-risk individuals and high clinical suspicion for early diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism.  This patient will benefit from aggressive Hematology consultation for long-term anticoagulation  aggressive risk factor modification - smoking cessation  tight glycemic and blood pressure control - and respiratory therapy for optimization of COPD management. Smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation would have a positive effect on his overall COPD management  and improve his prognosis along with ongoing management for his type 2 diabetes. His family should also undergo risk factor screening based on his family history of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,95,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American male  named John  who has recently been diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). This patient hails from a lower socioeconomic region in Alabama  and despite maintaining an active lifestyle  John's BMI is 30.6  classifying him as obese. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which are well-controlled with prescribed medication. In his family background  there is a history of cardiac diseases.  Presenting Complaint:  John was initially brought to the ER after complaining of sudden onset sharp  pleuritic chest pain and difficulty breathing. The difficulty was significantly worse when taking deep breaths. There were no reports of dizziness  fainting  or loss of consciousness.   Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension  for which he has been taking Lisinopril for the past 10 years  and hypercholesterolemia managed with Atorvastatin. He was also diagnosed with Prediabetes two years ago but has not required any medication so far due to lifestyle modifications. John is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only occasionally. He has no known allergies.  Physical Exam:  At presentation  he was alert and conscious but appeared anxious and mildly distressed. His pulse was 110 beats per minute  the blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.  Investigations:  Laboratory tests were significant for elevated D-dimer levels. An Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise normal. Chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia or pleural effusion. A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism. The embolism was located in the left pulmonary artery. No signs of deep vein thrombosis were observed in Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs.  Treatment:  John was initiated on anticoagulant therapy with Low Molecular Weight Heparin and later bridged to Oral Anticoagulants. He showed significant improvement with the treatment  and the plan is to continue the oral anticoagulant for at least three months and then reevaluate.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering Acute Pulmonary Embolism in patients presenting with chest pain and dyspnea  even in the absence of the classical risk factors. The seemingly healthy individuals with a family history of cardiac disease may have underlying genetic predispositions increasing their risks of developing thromboembolic diseases. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,96,Patient Profile:  Mr. John Richardson  a 65-year-old African-American man  was admitted to our hospital with complaints of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting. He resides in New York  and is widowed with two adult children.  Past Medical History:  The patient reports to have been diagnosed with hypertension and type-2 diabetes ten years ago  and these are well controlled with medication. He also had a deep vein thrombosis approx. five years ago for which he had taken anticoagulants. The patient denied any history of major illnesses like myocardial infarction  stroke  or COPD.  Family History:  Richardson disclosed that his father died at the age of 72 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother had type-2 diabetes and passed away at 77. One of his two siblings was diagnosed with early-onset coronary artery disease.  Social History:  Mr. Richardson drank alcohol socially and smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for twenty-five years. He quit smoking after his deep vein thrombosis diagnosis. He worked in an office setting and his lifestyle was overall sedentary.  Current Complaints and Diagnosis: Mr. Richardson was brought in by his son due to a sudden fainting episode at home  accompanied by severe shortness of breath and high-grade fever. Initial physical examination noted decreased breath sounds on the lower part of the right lung  tachycardia  and low O2 saturation (89%). A CT scan confirmed the presence of an acute pulmonary embolism in the right lung.  Plan of Action: The patient was started on oxygen therapy and  considering the size of the clot and his history of DVT  an IVC filter was placed and systemic thrombolytic therapy was initiated. Frequent monitoring was done to check vital parameters and any potential bleeding complications. He was prescribed a course of anticoagulants to prevent future episodes and advised on lifestyle changes like a low-fat diet  moderate exercise  and maintaining a healthy weight. He will undergo pulmonary rehabilitation to improve his breathing.   Preventive measures should also be undertaken for his immediate family due to the presence of diseases like hypertension  type-2 diabetes  and coronary artery disease in the family history which could lead to a tendency for clot formation.   Thus  this case presents a patient with acute pulmonary embolism with comorbidities of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  having a past personal and family history of thrombotic events emphasizing the role of genetic predisposition and lifestyle habits in disease development. Regular follow-ups were advised to ensure proper compliance and monitoring of the patient's condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,97,Patient Identification: Mr. R.S. is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who works as an accountant.  Presenting Problem: He was presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness.  Past Medical History: Mr. R.S. was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years back and hypertension 3 years back. He also had surgery for a herniated disc five years ago. He has been a smoker for 30 years and consumes alcohol socially.  Family History: His paternal grandfather and father both died from a myocardial infarction in their 60s. His mother is alive and well but has diagnosed hypertension and mitral valve prolapse. He has two younger sisters  one of which has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Investigations: Initial workup including an ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no other significant ischemic changes. Blood investigations revealed elevated D-dimer and troponin levels. Chest X-Ray didn't show any consolidation or pneumothorax. A CT pulmonary angiogram was done which showed filling defects in the segmental branches of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.   Impression: Mr. R.S. was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism. His risk factors were his recent surgery  advanced age  smoking  family history  and sedentary lifestyle.   Treatment Plan: He was initially kept on oxygen and administered low molecular weight heparin. Further anticoagulation therapy was planned with oral Warfarin up to 3-6 months as per the standard recommendation.  Discussion: This case highlights that treatments have to be individualized and patient-centric. A multidisciplinary approach involving the pulmonology team  cardiology team  and hematologists is required to handle complex cases like this.  Lifestyle advice was also given in terms of smoking cessation  weight management  regular exercise  and diet control for diabetes. Early physiotherapy was advised to prevent joint stiffness and to ensure early mobility.  Follow up and monitoring were discussed and planned with the patient to monitor his functional status and anticoagulants level. Regular monitoring of his blood sugars and blood pressure was also advised to keep his other comorbid conditions under control.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,98,Patient Presentation:  Now  let's discuss the case of a 52-year-old African American male patient we'll call Mr. L. He hails from New York City  works as a high school teacher and is an active member of his local community sports club. His lifestyle is often stressful  but he manages to keep active regularly. He has a habit of smoking 10 cigarettes each day and enjoys casual drinking during the weekends. He does not have any known allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mr. L has been hypertensive for the last 10 years  which has been controlled with medication - lisinopril 10mg once daily. His compliance with medication is poor  often forgetting to take it due to his busy schedule. In addition  he suffers from occasional migraines and hyperlipidemia but takes no medication for these. He also had a sedentary job which increased his risk of thrombosis.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient sought medical attention after experiencing sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp  penetrating chest pain on the right side that worsened upon taking deep breaths  and a sense of impending doom.   Complete Demographics:  Mr. L is married with two children. His wife is a nurse at a local health center. He has a bachelor's degree in History. He is from a working-class socioeconomic background and lives in an urban environment.  Family History:  His father suffered from a stroke at the age of 65 and his mother had breast cancer diagnosed at the age of 55. He has one sibling who suffers from type II diabetes. There's no known family history of coagulation disorders or pulmonary diseases.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  A series of investigations were conducted. His D-dimer levels were elevated. A Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) revealed multiple emboli lodged in the bilateral pulmonary arteries. He was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Follow-up:  Mr. L was started on a course of unfractionated heparin and later bridged to warfarin as part of his long-term management. He was advised to stop smoking  moderate his alcohol intake  manage his stress levels  and improve his compliance with medications. The importance of regular check-ups was also stressed upon.   This case thus presents a typical profile of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism characterized by modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  smoking  and a sedentary lifestyle. It underlines the importance of lifestyle modifications in the prevention of such life-threatening conditions. In terms of demographic representation  African American adults represent about a third of all PE cases in the U.S  with males showing a slight predominance over females. Therefore  our case does mirror accurate demographic representation per the literature.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,99,Patient Profile: Patient's Name: Ms. Johnson Age: 68 Sex: Female Race: African American Occupational History: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Johnson was admitted to the emergency department presenting dyspnea  chest pain  and faintness.   Past Medical History:  No previous major health issues. Regular check-ups showed normal body functions. She has an annual history of influenza primarily during winter. Mild hypertensive but well-managed with medication.  Family History: Her father died of a stroke at the age of 65  and her mother was diagnosed with diabetes but managed with insulin. Her elder brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease  and her younger sister is asthmatic.  Social History: She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. She usually walks her dog and does light exercises. She lives alone in a well-maintained house located in a suburban area.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  heart rate was 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Lung exam revealed reduced breath sounds on the left lower lung. Her labs showed a D-Dimer of 0.8 mcg/mL and slightly elevated troponin levels.  Diagnostics Assessments: A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment: She was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism and promptly started on anticoagulation therapy. Given her hypertensive state  the medical team also adjusted her blood pressure medication.  'Discussion:  African American women  like Ms. Johnson  are reported to be less likely to develop venous thromboembolism  which includes pulmonary embolism  compared to Caucasian women. However  the risk increases with age  obesity  surgery  or immobility. In this case  Ms. Johnson's hypertensive status may have contributed to her developing a pulmonary embolism.   Despite these risk factors  the medical literature shows that pulmonary embolism often goes undiagnosed  especially in black women  due to less awareness and a lower suspicion of the condition. Therefore  it is important to consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis when presented with symptoms such as sudden onset unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  and faintness.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,9,100,Subject: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Study  Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith  categorized as overweight with a BMI of 30. He has resided in Austin  Texas for the past 30 years. John is married with two children  both adults. As a retired police officer  much of his time is spent gardening and reading. He is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago after a 30-year pack-a-day habit. Furthermore  he consumes alcohol moderately and was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and Hypertension a year ago.   Past Medical History: John's history includes controlled hypertension and type II diabetes. He is on Metformin (1000mg twice daily) for the latter and Losartan (50mg once daily) for the former. Previously  he had no hospitalizations. His annual physical and laboratory tests were generally within normal limits  with an occasional elevation in blood glucose and pressure within the past two years.  Presenting Complaint:  John was brought to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started while gardening. He described the chest pain as 'sharp and jabbing' that increased with deep breathing.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at 62  and his elder brother in his mid-60s had undergone angioplasty. His mother  who is alive and well in her late 80s  has a history of stroke in her early 70s.  Examination & Diagnosis:  Upon examination  John's vital signs were: BP-136/88 mm Hg  HR-110 bpm  RR-24 breaths per minute  Temp- 98.8°F  and SpO2- 92% on room air. ECG and blood tests suggested an acute pulmonary embolism  later confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiogram. D-dimer levels were significantly raised.  Management and Follow-up: John was started immediately on oxygen therapy and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an initial treatment for acute pulmonary embolism. Following discharge  he was advised to continue on oral anticoagulants for at least three months. He will be following up with a pulmonologist and his primary care provider every month to monitor anticoagulation status and remain under strict control for his diabetes and hypertension.  Discussion: This case underscores the necessity of considering acute pulmonary embolism as the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  especially in older adults with risk factors such as obesity  prolonged immobilization  or a genetic predisposition to develop clotting disorders. Early detection and prompt treatment are critical in decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with pulmonary embolism.  Reference Range:  The chosen demographics align with statistical data showing a majority of pulmonary embolism cases are found in individuals aged 40-60+  with Caucasian males being commonly affected (Cushman et al.  2016).
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,1,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 58 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Truck Driver  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson is a smoker and has been diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. He reports to control his hypertension and diabetes with appropriate medication. He also reports having a sedentary lifestyle due to his truck driving job. He has no previous history of surgeries or significant illnesses. He reports no known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of shortness of breath that started about 2 hours ago. These symptoms were associated with mild chest pain that he describes as 'a heavy feeling'. He also reports a moderate  dry cough and mild throbbing pain in his right calf which has been present for the past two days. He denies fever  haemoptysis  or recent injuries.  Literature-Based Context: According to the literature  acute pulmonary embolism presents more commonly in individuals aged above 40 years. Risk factors include smoking  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and long-travel history; all of which apply to Mr. Johnson. The African American population is known for a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus  which subsequently increases the risk of thromboembolic diseases. Notably  the clinical presentation varies in different patients  and it may not always present with typical symptoms. Nonetheless  dyspnoea and chest pain are common symptoms as experienced by Mr. Johnson. The lower limb pain might suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which is a known precursor of pulmonary embolism.  Through this case  the medical students should be able to learn about the risk factors  presentation  diagnosis  and management of acute pulmonary embolism. Moreover  it emphasizes the importance of understanding the pathophysiology and relation between DVT and pulmonary embolism  as well as understanding various preventive measures that could potentially eliminate the occurrence of such events.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,2,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Mrs. Brenda L.  a 68-year-old Caucasian female originally from Boston  with a primary language of English  living in a nursing facility due to her mobility issues and dependency for daily chores. She is a retired office assistant  a widow for the last 7 years  and mother of 2 adult children living on their own. She is a former smoker (30 pack-years) and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Past Medical History: Patient has a known history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes  all of which are well-controlled with medication. She had left hip replacement surgery six weeks prior  after which she became less mobile due to fear of falling. She has been on bed rest for the most part of the day - a major risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism. She also suffered from morbid obesity (BMI: 35) and obstructive sleep apnea.  Key Complaints: For the last 48 hours  Brenda has been complaining about increased shortness of breath notably on exertion  and a feeling of anxiety  despite no change in her daily routine. She also describes a sharp  stabbing chest pain that gets worse when she takes a deep breath or coughs. Overnight  her condition has worsened  and she now reports lightheadedness and an increased heart rate.  The culmination of Brenda's clinical presentation and risk profile prompt a high clinical suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism. After a comprehensive physical examination  follow-up diagnostic tests would be required to confirm the diagnosis  initiate appropriate therapeutic interventions  and manage her further.  This case  while fabricated for the educational goals  reflects critically important aspects of acute pulmonary embolism such as risk factors (immobility  recent surgery  obesity  age  and others)  clinical presentation (dyspnea  chest pain  tachycardia  etc.)  and emphasizes the sudden and life-threatening nature of the condition. Relevant literature supports that acute PE is more common in the elderly  with a slight woman predominance. It is hoped that this case will prompt students to appreciate the importance of early recognition and treatment of acute PE and to always consider it in differential diagnoses when faced with similar presentations.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,3,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: Elizabeth Martinez Age: 64 years old Race: Hispanic Gender: Sex: Female Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: 1. Chronic atrial fibrillation for the past 4 years.  2. Hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled with medication. 3. Varicose veins surgery 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Elizabeth came to the ER with a principal complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath for about three hours duration. She also noted a sharp chest pain that increased with deep breaths and made her feel lightheaded. She had no significant cough or fever but reported a sense of anxiety and slight confusion. She had been feeling more tired than usual for the past week but had no other specific complaints.  Family History: Father died of heart attack at age 70. Mother had stroke at age 65 and is currently alive.  Discussion: The demographics chosen were based on various studies  which reports that pulmonary embolism (PE) is slightly more likely in females  and risks increase with age. Typically  the onset of symptoms is sudden. Shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness are common symptoms of PE. Elizabeth's prior history of atrial fibrillation marks her at a higher risk of developing blood clots  and the fatigue she experienced the week prior may be a non-specific symptom of PE. Additionally  the surgery she had for varicicose veins increases her risk due to potential immobility post-procedure. Ethnicity was chosen as Hispanic  which is an underrepresented population in medical studies  adding to the need for attentive focus on every patient's individual risks and presentation. Her familial medical history adds a genetic predisposition to poor vascular health and thrombotic events. This case will emphasize recognition of risk factors  appropriate diagnostics  and effective management principles of acute PE to medical students.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,4,Case Report:  Patient Information: Name: Mr. David Sanchez Gender: Male Age: 52 Race: Hispanic Occupation: Factory Worker  Past Medical History:  - Patient has a documented history of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg 5 years prior  which was treated with anticoagulants.  - No history of respiratory diseases. - Moderate smoker (15 - 20 cigarettes/day for the past 30 years) - Regular alcohol consumption and mild obesity (BMI: 30)  Presenting Complaints: 1. Rapid onset severe shortness of breath. 2. Sharp  chest pain that gets worse with deep breaths. 3. Light-headedness and episodes of fainting. 4. Low-grade fever. 5. Hemoptysis/coughing up blood.  Note: The acute onset of these symptoms is suggestive of an embolic event. Consideration should be given to the possibility of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  given the patient's previously diagnosed DVT (although lacking currently) and his risk factors  including smoking  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle with prolonged periods of inactivity due to his work habits.  Demographic Justification: The presentation has been written considering that pulmonary embolismon  in fact  occurs in men and women almost equally  although literature suggests a slightly higher prevalence in men. Adults of all ages are affected  but incidence increases with age. The primary risk factors for PE include a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)  cancer  immobility  and major surgery. A significant proportion of PE patients are found to have recurrent deep vein thrombosis. The Hispanic ethnicity was selected for appropriate demographic representation. The risk factors such as smoking  age factor  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle align well with the literature and population data.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,5,Case Summary:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Robert Walker Age: 50 years old  Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Occupation: Manager at a corporate firm Lifestyle: Smoking (15 cigarettes/day for the past 20 years)  sedentary  high fat diet  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension managed with medication for the past 5 years 2. Diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2  six months ago  managed through diet and oral hypoglycemic agents 3. Family history of cardiovascular disease (Father suffered from myocardial infarction at age 60) 4. No known allergies  Key Complaints: Mr. Walker presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset chest pain. According to him  the pain started approximately 1 hour prior  after coming back from a business trip that required a long flight. He describes the chest pain as sharp  and localized to the central and left side of his chest  with a severity of 8 out of 10. The pain is aggravated by deep breathing. He also complains of shortness of breath  dizziness  occasional palpitations  and light-headedness. He seems frightened and anxious about these new symptoms. He denies symptoms of cough  fever  or leg swelling. Mr. Walker looks visibly distressed  is sweating profusely and looks pale.  Procedure: It’s anticipated that medical students must promptly and accurately identify this potentially life-threatening condition  using clues from the patient's demographic data  lifestyle choices  past medical history  and current symptoms  to guide their history taking  physical examination  interpretation of relevant investigations  and treatment plan. A thorough discussion about differential diagnoses  like myocardial infarction  pneumonia  and anxiety disorder  should also be included  highlighting the diagnostic importance of each presenting symptom in acute pulmonary embolism.                            
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,6,Patient Identification: Ms. Sofia Guzman  a 65-year-old Hispanic female.  Past Medical History:  Guzman has a noted history of obesity (BMI: 35)  Type II Diabetes mellitus  and Hypertension. She was also previously diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years back and was treated accordingly. She is a former-smoker with a 20-year pack history  although she quit 15 years ago. She is currently on oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensive medication. She had a total knee replacement surgery one month ago due to severe osteoarthritis  for which she has been relatively immobile.   Key Complaints:  She arrived at the emergency department (ED) today with complaints of sudden-onset shortness of breath that has been ongoing for the last few hours. She described the associated chest discomfort as a 'sharp  stabbing' pain that becomes worse with deep breaths. She also stated she has experienced a dry cough and a fainting episode prior to her admission.   Rationale: The representation of a Hispanic female patient of older age aligns with literature suggesting an increasing incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) with age. Additionally  Pulmonary Embolism is common in patients with a history of DVT and knee replacement surgery  both of which Ms. Guzman has. Obesity  smoking  and hypertension are also identified risk factors. Presenting symptoms such as sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest discomfort  faintness  and cough align with typical clinical manifestations of PE. Consequently  this makes a reasonable case for a PE presentation  considering the demographic factors and the clinical context. The case is designed to help students understand the links between risk factors  to recognize symptoms  and to guide the appropriate next steps in diagnosis and treatment. Rigorous reading and knowledge are essential; however  encountering such a typical patient case helps to reinforce the textbook information and translates it into clinical decision-making skills.   [Note: The medical educator should discuss the key investigations (like D-Dimer Test  CT Pulmonary Angiography etc)  probable findings  and discuss the appropriate management approach (anticoagulation  thrombolytics  etc) depending on the patient's condition and contraindications. The topic of PE prevention should also be touched upon].
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,7,Case Report:  **Patient Information**:  Mr. Williams  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the Emergency Department.  **Past Medical History**:  His medical history includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He's currently on lisinopril  metformin  and tiotropium bromide. Two weeks ago  he underwent arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the left hip.  **Chief Complaints**:  He is complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath since morning which has progressively worsened over the day. He also reports sharp chest pain that gets worse while taking a deep breath. Minor associated symptoms include lightheadedness  cough  and a low-grade fever.  **Demographic Representation**:  This scenario represents an accurate demographic as the incidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is particularly high among older adults  and COPD patients. Furthermore  factors such as recent surgery (increased risk for 3 months)  hospitalization  and immobilization are known predisposing factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which can lead to PE. Diabetes and hypertension  coupled with the patient's former smoking habits are reflective of the common comorbidity pattern. This case also portrays realistic gender demographics as the American Heart Association mentions PE does not drastically favor men or women.  [The subsequent parts of this training case should include a detailed physical examination  appropriate diagnostic tests (like D-dimer  CT pulmonary angiography  etc.)  diagnosis discussion  treatment protocols  and patient education.]
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,8,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographic:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2  residing in an urban environment. He is a retired factory worker  living with his wife. He is a non-smoker and doesn't consume alcohol.  Past Medical History:  The patient has chronic hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  which are both optimally controlled. There is a history of intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease. The patient also had a right hip replacement 2 months ago without any immediate post-operative complications. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and aspirin at low dosage. There is no known drug allergy.  Key complaints:  The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of a sudden feeling of breathlessness that started roughly 2 hours prior. He describes his dyspnea as worsening with exertion and better when he is at rest. Accompanying the breathlessness is a mild  stabbing chest pain on the right side that gets worse with a deep inspiration. The pain is pleuritic in nature (increased with breathing). He also reported an episode of hemoptysis (coughing up blood). He denies any leg pain or swelling  fever  or recent travel.   Rationale:  This case is designed to be representative of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  clearly highlighting the classic symptoms: sudden onset breathlessness  pleuritic chest pain  and hemoptysis. It also includes several risk factors such as older age  obesity  African-American ethnicity  postoperative status  and previous peripheral arterial disease - which all increase PE susceptibility.    The demographic details were chosen to represent a vulnerable population. African Americans have a higher risk of PE. Also  individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds  like our patient - a retired factory worker living in an urban setting  are more likely to experience health disparities associated with PE (and other conditions)  so it's crucial that medical students learn to recognize and manage such presentations competently.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,9,"Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old African American female. The patient is retired and lives with her husband in a suburban setting. She is a non-smoker with a past history of moderate alcohol consumption. The patient has two adult children.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with Metformin. Additionally  she has a past diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after a hip replacement surgery 5 years ago. Hypertension managed with Lisinopril is also noted in her medical history. The patient has a family history of cardiac diseases; her father died from a myocardial infarction at 70. Body mass index (BMI) is recorded to be 28  which falls under 'overweight'.   Key Complaints: The patient comes to the emergency room presenting with sudden onset of chest pain  which is described as a """"sharp  stabbing"""" pain that gets worse with deep breaths. Additionally  the patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and a high heart rate. She also reports that she has been feeling lightheaded and has had fainting spells over the past couple of days. Upon further questioning  she also mentions a mild  dry cough that she has had for the last two days.   This case spotlights an individual who is at a slightly higher risk for acute pulmonary embolism due to her race (with the prevalence of PE being highest among African Americans according to literature)  age  history of DVT  obesity  and presence of other risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. This case can be used to emphasize the importance of considering all risks factors  taking a thorough medical history  and not overlooking key early signs and symptoms of life-threatening conditions such as an acute pulmonary embolism."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,10,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 65-year-old African American female with an occupation as a retired school teacher. She is a nonsmoker but with a previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her BMI is 30 indicating obesity.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of DVT which occurred five years ago  Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and controlled Hypertension. She reports medication adherence for her diabetes (Metformin) and hypertension (Lisinopril). She had a hysterectomy 20 years ago and has been on and off hormone replacement therapy. She has also been diagnosed with genetic thrombophilia. She has no known drug allergies.   Key Complaints: She was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breathe which she graded as 7/10 in severity. She also complained of a sudden onset of chest pain which is pleuritic in nature  confusion and light-headedness. She denied any recent prolonged periods of immobility  recent surgeries  or trauma other than a sprained wrist 2 weeks ago. However  she admits 2 to 3 days of uncharacteristically low physical activity and states she had been feeling unusually fatigued.  This case report incorporates increased risk factors for Pulmonary Embolism including age  genetic thrombophilia  a history DVT  surgery  and obesity which are prevalent in African American women. This case has been framed to provide students with a realistic and complex patient background that can help them hone their skill of diagnosing and managing Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Given the diverse nature of PE and its manifestations  it is hoped that this case will enable learners to form a broad differential diagnosis and manage the patient holistically. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,11,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics:  - Name: Mrs. Deborah Johnson - Age: 68 years old - Race/Ethnicity: African-America - Occupation: Retired School Teacher - Religion: Christian - Marital Status: Widowed - Residing: Assisted Living Facility  Past Medical History:  - Mrs. Johnson has a history of hypertension  managed with medication. - She has been obese most of her adult life with a current BMI of 37. - She had a total knee replacement surgery on her right knee 8 weeks ago. - She has a 10-year history of smoking but quit 15 years ago. - No known allergies.  Key Complaints:  - Mrs. Johnson was brought to the ER by the ambulance from her assisted living facility. - She reports sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain that started approximately 2 hours ago. - She describes the chest pain as sharp and stabbing  located in the middle of the chest  rating it 8 out of 10  that gets worse with deep breathing. - She also reports feeling lightheaded and mentions about a fainting spell just prior to her arrival at the emergency department.  Note:   The patient’s age  obesity  recent orthopedic surgery  and history of smoking are her risk factors for developing a pulmonary embolism. Her ethnicity (African-American) is mentioned as it has been noted in literature that the incidence and mortality of pulmonary embolism might be higher amongst African-Americans. The complaints of sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and fainting spells are typical of acute pulmonary embolism and are considered medical emergencies due to the risk of sudden death.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,12,Patient Information: Mr. Roberto Gomez  a 61-year-old Hispanic male  retired high school teacher.  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of severe chest pain and unexplained shortness of breath that started a few hours ago while he was gardening.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Gomez recalls the pain was sharp and intense  radiating to his left shoulder and jaw. The pain and breathlessness aggravated after exertion and decreased with rest. He also admitted to bouts of perspiration and faint lightheadedness. He denies any trauma  cough  fever or sputum production. Recent travel  prolonged immobilization or history of trauma/surgery is also negative. No known allergies.  Past Medical History: Mr. Gomez has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  for which he takes medication daily (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). A remote history of smoking is present  he quit about 15 years ago. His father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 64.  Vitals on Presentation: Blood Pressure: 152/92 mmHg Pulse: Radial pulse 110 bpm  irregular Respiratory Rate: 28 breaths/min Oxygen Saturation: 92% on room air Temperature: Afebrile  Physical Examination: Mr. Gomez appeared tachypneic and anxious. Chest exam revealed tachycardia with clear lung fields bilaterally; no murmurs  rubs  or gallops noted in the heart sounds. There was mild peripheral edema present in his lower limbs  more on left side.  Social History: Mr. Gomez lives with his wife  has 2 adult children who are healthy. He used to be a pack-a-day smoker but hadn’t had a cigarette in the last 15 years. He is an occasional drinker.  Preliminary differential diagnoses would include Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Acute Myocardial Infarction  Pericarditis  and Pneumothorax. Given the sudden onset of non-exertional chest pain  tachycardia  tachypnea  recent hypercoagulable state (hypertension and hyperlipidemia)  and mildly desaturated oxygen levels  Acute Pulmonary Embolism is highly suspected.    Based on this case  students will engage in further investigations including ECG  Chest X-Ray  D-dimer test and if required  a CT Pulmonary Angiography leading to appropriate management and patient counseling. Students will also be encouraged to think about risk prediction stratification and prevention of pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,13,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Sanchez Gender: Male Age: 52 Race/ Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Truck Driver Smoking history: 20 cigarettes/day for the past 30 years.   Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32. He has been diagnosed with Hypertension (HTN) 5 years ago  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 3 years  both of which are managed with medications. He also has a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation. He had a right lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  for which he received treatment.  Key Complaints: Mr. Sanchez presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness. The chest pain was pleuritic in nature  sharp  and located in the right side of his chest. His symptoms worsened on exertion and slightly improved while lying down. The patient denied having fever  cough  or any leg pain/swelling.   References: - Acute Pulmonary Embolism: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend that patients like Mr. Sanchez should be considered high risk given his history of DVT and current symptoms.  - Demographics: Statistics show that Pulmonary Embolism can occur in any race/ethnicity. However  African Americans may have a significantly higher incidence than Whites or Hispanics. Men are slightly more likely to suffer from PE than women. Moreover  a risk factor such as prolonged immobility increases the likelihood of PE  which is relevant for occupations like truck drivers. Obesity  HTN  diabetes  and smoking also predispose to PE.  - Gender: Although PE occurs in both males and females  some studies suggest a slightly higher incidence in males.  - Age: PE is more frequent in middle-aged and older adults  with incidence increasing with age. - Ethnicity: While PE occurs in all races/ethnicities  some studies have found higher rates in African American and Hispanic populations.   The case is designed to represent an average patient who may develop PE based on the risks and demographics. There is opportunity for discussing diagnosis  treatment  and prevention strategies within a broader healthcare context.   Please note: The same real-life scenario can reflect different races  genders  etc. The objective is to encourage a non-biased approach rather than stereotyping the patient. It also highlights the importance of effective communication in multicultural settings.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,14,Patient Case:  Patient Demographics: John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male who works as a retired professor and enjoys gardening. The patient's weight is 220 lbs  and his height is around 6 feet. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. His family history reveals that his father died due to a massive pulmonary embolism while his mother had diabetes.  Past Medical History: John was previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and has been controlled on metformin. He was treated for deep vein thrombosis in his left leg around four years ago. John also has a 20-year history of controlled high blood pressure on Lisinopril. Besides  he has osteoarthritis that limits his mobility and talks of chronic pain in his knee joints. No surgical interventions were performed in the past.  Chief Complaints: John presented himself at the emergency department (ED)  complaining of sudden-onset shortness of breath that has been ongoing for the past few hours  accompanied by sharp  stabbing chest pain which grew worse with deep inspiration. He also stated that he felt lightheaded and experienced a brief episode of fainting at home. Moreover  John mentioned a slightly swollen  red area on his left leg that was tender to touch  which he noticed a couple of days ago.  This brief medical case scenario is consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism  with John's past history of DVT  limited mobility due to osteoarthritis  and other risk factors such as age  race  and family history making him more susceptible to the condition. Literature reports a higher prevalence of pulmonary embolism among African American individuals  with individuals aged over 60 also being at higher risk. Other factors such as sedentary lifestyle and prior venous thromboembolism history may contribute to the risk. The condition should be immediately suspected considering the sudden onset of unexplained dyspnea  chest pain that intensifies on inspiration  and fainting. His swollen leg can be a hint towards a new DVT. The presence of atypical symptoms such as lightheadedness and fainting further supports the diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,15,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient's Information:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 62 years Sex: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired office worker  Demographics:  Based on the literature  the patients most commonly affected by acute pulmonary embolism are adults over 60 years old  with a slightly higher incidence in males. While African-Americans are slightly less likely to suffer from pulmonary embolism than Caucasians or people of European descent  it's essential to be mindful that pulmonary embolism can affect individuals of any race or ethnicity.  Medical History:  John Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  for which he regularly takes prescribed medications. He had a total knee replacement surgery 2 years ago due to osteoarthritis. John is an ex-smoker and quit 5 years ago after a 30-year pack-history. He has a BMI of 28  indicating overweight. He led a sedentary lifestyle after his retirement. There is no known family history of blood clots or inherited blood clot disorders.  Key Complaints:  John presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of shortness of breath that began earlier in the day  alongside a sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. He also mentioned a persistent dry cough  symptoms of fatigue and dizziness. On further inquiry  he mentioned that for the past week  he had been experiencing increasing swelling and mild pain in his right calf. John also stated feeling more anxious than usual due to these symptoms.  This case is designed keeping in mind the most common risk factors for developing acute pulmonary embolism  such as age  hypertension  recent surgical procedure  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and presence of other conditions like diabetes. Symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism  as seen in the key complaints  include sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  leg pain or swelling  and feelings of anxiety.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,16,Case Report - Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Andrea Thompson Age: 67 years Sex: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired teacher Location: Memphis  Tennessee  USA  Background: Mrs. Thompson has been living alone since her husband's death last year. She has 2 children who visit her frequently. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She reports leading a sedentary lifestyle since retiring five years ago.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Thompson has a history of a few medical conditions. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 12 years ago. Both conditions are under control with medication. She also has a past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which was treated effectively 8 years ago. Furthermore  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery on her right knee 1 year ago.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Thompson presented to the Emergency Department reporting severe sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain that worsens with deep breathing  and fainting episodes during the past 24 hours. She also mentions a recent bout of flu that kept her mostly bedridden the previous week. On further questioning  she revealed noticing unexplained swelling and pain in her left calf for the past few days.  Note:  This case is designed keeping in mind the higher incidence of Pulmonary Embolism amongst older  African American females. Mrs. Thompson's history of DVT  recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  and limited mobility due to recent illness make her a high-risk candidate for APE. The case aims to highlight key risk factors  symptoms  and the need for thorough patient history for diagnosis. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,17,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Residential Area: Urban  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension  diagnosed at age 45  currently managed with lisinopril - Type II Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed at age 50  currently managed with metformin - Previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years prior  managed with warfarin  discontinued after six months  - Nonsmoker  moderate alcohol use.  Current Presentation:  The patient presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and cough. She mentions a recent 12-hour car trip. The pain typically feels sharp and worsens with deep breaths. Cough was initially dry but has later become mildly productive with streaks of blood. She has no associated fever but feels light-headed.  Patient does not report any recent trauma  surgery or prolonged bed rest. She notes no significant lower limb swelling or pain. She reports good adherence with her hypertension and diabetes medication. Family history is positive for a genetic clotting disorder  but she was never tested.  This case aims to illustrate the presentation of acute pulmonary embolism and the associated risk factors including older age  prior DVT  long car trip (prolonged immobility)  hypertension  and family history of a clotting disorder. The student should be able to gather pertinent information  evaluate the patient's symptoms  and initiate appropriate initial management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,18,Patient Case:  Patient Details: - Age: 67 years old - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Hispanic  Past Medical History: This patient has a history of hypertension and obesity for which she has been taking antihypertensive drugs and making lifestyle changes  respectively. She also has a recent travel history 8 days back where she drove cross-country  showcasing prolonged immobilization. There is also a reported family history of deep vein thrombosis. She is a non-smoker and occasional alcohol drinker. She does not have any known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe sudden onset chest pain  which she described as 'sharp' and 'stabbing'  and the pain was worsening with deep breaths. She also reported experiencing episodes of breathlessness and palpitation since the onset of the chest pain  which was approximately 4 hours before presentation. Upon further questioning  she also admitted sporadic episodes of light-headedness and a single episode of hemoptysis at home. There has been no fever  cough  or nocturnal dyspnea.  On physical examination  the patient was anxious  had an elevated heart rate (110 bpm)  increased respiratory rate (20 breaths per minute)  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  and slightly elevated blood pressure (145/90 mmHg). On auscultation  there were signs of reduced breath sound present in the lower right lobe with tachycardia  but cardiovascular exam was otherwise normal.   The case is representing the classic symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. Sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  hemoptysis  and signs of hypoxia are commonly seen in this condition. The patient's risk factors include her hypertension  prolonged immobilization due to a recent long-distance travel  obesity  and a family history of DVT. Such a patient needs immediate diagnosis using D-dimer testing  CT pulmonary angiography or Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) scanning  and treatment with anticoagulant therapy.  By exposing learners to this case  they will have the opportunity to understand the significance of recognizing common risk factors  symptoms  and immediate management of acute pulmonary embolism  while also acknowledging the importance of patient history and physical examination in a clinical setting.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,19,Patient Case Information:  Patient's Profile:  60-year-old African-American female.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of obesity  hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also had a total hip replacement surgery four weeks ago and has been less active since. This is significant as immobilization is a major risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism. The patient's family history reveals her mother had a deep vein thrombosis in her late sixties.  Chief Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency room with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest discomfort  and light-headedness. She describes the chest pain as sharp  localized in the middle of her chest  and that it worsens when taking deep breaths. She also reports a recent unexplained cough but denies fever or recent travel.  Assessment:  This is a classic presentation for acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  especially given the patient's past medical history  recent surgery and immobilization. The clinical symptoms of acute PE can vary greatly but typically include sudden-onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and light-headedness as described by the patient.   According to literature  African-American patients are found to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism  including obesity and surgery  as we see in this patient's history. Women  particularly postmenopausal women  have an increased risk for PE compared with men.  Next Step:  In this case  a high level of suspicion for acute PE has to be kept. A set of diagnostic studies including D-Dimer test  CT pulmonary angiography  or ventilation-perfusion scan should be considered immediately. Initiation of anticoagulation therapy might be considered based on the PE severity and risk of bleeding  until the diagnosis is confirmed or ruled out.  This case is designed to help students in recognizing the common symptoms of acute PE  understand its major risk factors like recent surgery  prolonged immobility  obesity and hypertension  and guide them to perform relevant diagnostic order to confirm or rule out the condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,20,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Carter Age: 65 Years  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: Mrs. Carter has a past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She is a non-smoker  but has been progressively leading a sedentary lifestyle since retiring 5 years ago. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which occurred about 9 years ago  and she underwent a major abdominal surgery around 6 months back.  Chief Complaints:  Mrs. Carter presented to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath following a long cross-country trip by car  which started a few hours before presenting to the hospital. Accompanying symptoms included palpitations  light-headedness  and chest discomfort which she described as a sharp pain upon deep inhalation that worsened during coughing. She denied any fever  cough  orthopnea  recent illness  or leg swelling.  Note: Epidemiologically  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is more common among middle-aged (especially over 60) and elderly individuals  regardless of gender. It is found to be frequent among people leading a sedentary lifestyle or immobilized post-surgery. Also  a past medical history of DVT or surgery are regarded as significant risks for PE. Therefore  this case is designed based on these demographic and risk factor considerations taken from medical literature.   Future sessions should focus on creating a differential diagnosis based on her presentation  as well as the interpretation of physical examination findings  appropriate investigations  and formulating a management plan for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,21,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male.  Past medical history:  Mr. Smith has a history of type 2 diabetes  diagnosed 10 years ago  which is managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a known history of hypertension for the past 5 years  controlled by ACE inhibitors and diuretics. He has been a smoker for around 40 years with a 20 pack-year tobacco smoking history. He does not have a known history of thromboembolism but his sister had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 70.   Chief complaints: Mr. Smith arrived at the ER with chief complaints of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started around 2 hours back. He rated the pain as 7 on a scale from 1-10  stating it was a sharp pain  located in the chest mostly on the right side. Pain intensified with deep inspiration. He also reported experiencing mild dizziness  moderate fatigue  and a general sense of anxiety. He denied any recent long-distance travel  surgery  or hospitalization.  Case Note: The high prevalence of conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes  and the high rate of tobacco use in the African American male population makes Mr. Smith's case an excellent example of demographic representation often seen in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. The addition of the patient's symptoms including chest pain  shortness of breath  and anxiety  and familial history of DVT makes this case multifaceted covering essential aspects necessary for the education of medical students.   Note: While the patient denies recent travel or surgical procedures  it's equally vital to include questions about these factors in the case study as prolong immobilization  surgery  and long-distance travel are strong predisposing factors to thromboembolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,22,Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 66-year-old African American male. He is a retired bank manager and is married with four children. He is a non-smoker with a BMI of 27  but has a sedentary lifestyle.   Past Medical History: The patient was known to have chronic hypertension regulated with medication (Lisinopril). 3 years ago he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on oral hypoglycemics (Metformin). He was also diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg seven years ago that was treated with anticoagulants at the time. He reports no known allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department complaining about sudden onset shortness of breath  palpitations and chest pain on the left side which he described as sharp in nature  and increased with deep breathing. He mentioned sudden onset calf pain and swelling on his right leg. He also reported feeling lightheaded with intermittent episodes of profuse sweating.  Note: The demographic representation in this case discussion is in line with the literature. According to studies  pulmonary embolism can occur in any age but the risk increases with age  and it can be more common with certain highlighted risk factors like history of DVT  hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle. African American populations have a higher prevalence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which can increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,23,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Age: 65-year-old Sex: Female  Race: White Occupation: Retired teacher Smoking: Non-smoker Religion: Roman Catholic Education: Bachelor’s degree in Education  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had right hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. She has been on medication for her chronic conditions  including an ACE inhibitor for hypertension and metformin for diabetes. Following her orthopedic surgery  she was directed to take oral analgesics as and when required.  Key Complaints:   The patient reported to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and unsteady heartbeats. She also mentioned that she had been feeling excessively tired over the past week with some occasional light-headedness. Upon further questioning  the patient reported occasional bouts of bloody cough.  [This case is designed keeping in focus the age group (60-79 years old)  gender (more common in females)  and race (more common in White/Caucasian) that are commonly associated with higher risk for Pulmonary Embolism. The patient’s recent surgery  particularly being an orthopedic one  also forms a crucial part of the case as post-surgical patients are found at increased risk of PE. The choice of comorbidities (hypertension  COPD  diabetes) is also reflective of common underlying conditions found in PE patients.]
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,24,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 65 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired truck driver  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension for which he has been on medication for the past 4 years. He is a former smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago. He also has Grade II obesity with a BMI of 35.7 kg/m². The patient had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago after a long-haul flight. He was adequately treated and has been on anticoagulation therapy since then  though reports compliance issues. He has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith has come in with complaints of shortness of breath that has been worsening over the past two days. He complained of sudden onset chest pain that is sharp  7/10  and worsens with deep inspiration. He also described palpitations  lightheadedness and a general feeling of un-wellness but no fever  cough or hemoptysis.  Discussion: Pulmonary embolism should be highly suspected given the patient's past medical history  obesity  non-compliance with anticoagulation therapy  and current clinical symptoms. Studies show that PE is more common in patients who are older (above 60 years) and those with prior history of venous thromboembolism. Also  PE shows higher preponderance in Caucasians than in other ethnicities. Hence  the demographic and clinical representation in this case is accurate as per available literature. The case would form an excellent learning opportunity for medical students to understand the connection between past medical history and current complaints in diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism.   Further tests like D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiography or a V/Q scan will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and the subsequent management can be discussed. This case should also include the importance of patient compliance and lifestyle modifications given the patient's history of obesity and hypertension.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,25,Case Scenario: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 65-year-old African-American female.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of obesity  hypertension  and her last child was delivered via cesarean section. She is a retired teacher  a non-smoker  and leads a rather sedentary lifestyle due to arthritis limiting mobility. She had a recent knee replacement surgery six weeks ago. There is no family history of thromboembolic disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reports sudden onset of shortness of breath at rest. This was accompanied by right-sided chest pain of a pleuritic nature. The symptoms started abruptly few hours ago. She denied any cough  hemoptysis  or recent long-distance travel. She also complained of a mild swelling in her right leg.  The demographic representation adheres to several risk factors of acute pulmonary embolism as indicated by multiple sources and literature. This includes advanced age  obesity  recent surgery  and limited mobility. African-Americans have a higher risk of thromboembolic disease compared to white individuals. Furthermore  females especially those with a history of cesarean section  are at greater risk.  The medical case above provides students with enough information to suspect acute PE and factors that lead to it. This case scenario not only stresses understanding the patient's presenting complaints but also the importance of obtaining a relevant medical history. Students should then be challenged to order and interpret appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and treat accordingly.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,26,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  Patient Profile:  Name: James Wilson Age: 63 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired firefighter  Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with losartan and atorvastatin. He was an active smoker for 20 years but quit smoking 15 years ago. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation surgery for a right tibial fracture 4 weeks ago  after slipping at home. After his surgery  he has been relatively immobile with occasional outside walks.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Wilson presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of breathlessness and pleuritic chest pain developed the night before. He noticed that his breathing discomfort aggravated when he was in a supine position. He also shared that he felt light-headed a couple of times when he got up from sitting. He denied cough  fever  hemoptysis  or recent travel history.  Rationale: These case features are frequently associated with pulmonary embolism. Elderly patients  postoperative immobility  previous smoking  and diseases such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia are noted risk factors. Elevated heart rate  increased respiratory rate  low blood pressure (especially with postural changes)  and low oxygen saturation are potential clinical signs to look for during examination. Symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain  dyspnea  and orthopnea should spur thoughts towards this diagnosis. Excluding other common presentations including acute coronary syndrome  pneumothorax  and pneumonia is crucial given symptom overlap.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,27,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Demographics: Our patient  Mr. Brown  is a 60-year-old African American male. According to studies  the incidence of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is higher in African American patients; consequently  it's crucial to consider the influence of race in PE risk assessment. He is a retired construction worker and is currently living a sedentary lifestyle. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  Mr Brown has a past medical history significant for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago  managed with anticoagulation therapy. He also has controlled systemic hypertension for ten years and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes seven years back  which is now on oral medication and diet control.   Complaints:  Mr. Brown was brought into the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain on his right side that worsens with deep breaths  lightheadedness  and an alarming increase in heart rate. He also mentioned a mild cough  with occasional hemoptysis  that started a couple of days ago.  These symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism match the demographic risk  considering his advanced age  racial background  history of DVT  sedentary lifestyle  and chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. The training case should focus on immediate diagnosis with methods such as D-Dimer testing  CT pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan  and prompt treatment with anticoagulation therapy or thrombolytic therapy  considering patient condition and risk factors. Making the right choices in diagnosis and management  by balancing risks and benefits  would be the critical learning points for medical students.  References: Tapson VF. Acute pulmonary embolism.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,28,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male  residing in a suburban neighborhood in New York City.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known diagnosis of hypertension  controlled with medications  and has a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which he is on anticoagulation therapy. He also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with an oral hypoglycemic agent. Other pertinent historical data include a past nicotine use  with the patient having quit smoking five years back  after a 30-year history. There is  however  no history of cardiopulmonary diseases  cancer  or known genetic disorders.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presents to the emergency department with an abrupt onset of unexplained dyspnea  tachypnea and pleuritic chest pain  which he describes as 'a tight band around his chest'. The patient also reports a syncopal episode at home  upon exertion  prior to arrival at the emergency room. His other complaints include minor cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum and calf pain and swelling on the right leg noticed a few days ago.  The patient's profile aligns with statistical data  as older age  chronic hypertension  diabetes  smoking  DVT history  and anticoagulation therapy all increase the risk of acute pulmonary embolism. African Americans also have higher rates of hypertension and diabetes and hence an elevated risk of embolic events.  The nature  combination  and sudden onset of the patient's symptoms serve as key indicators for a high probability of acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tools  like biomarkers and imaging studies  will help in confirming the diagnosis and guiding the management of this critical condition.

She also has hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and osteoarthritis. There is no history of cancer  surgery  or long periods of immobility. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. There is a family history of deep vein thrombosis.  Presenting complaints & symptoms: The patient presents to Emergency Department with acute onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that is worse on deep inspiration  these symptoms have been worsening over the past 2 hours. She has just returned from a long distance road trip two days ago. She denies any cough or fever. She also reports of light-headedness but no syncope. She has noticed slight swelling and tenderness on her left lower leg. There have been no alterations in her bowel or urinary habits.   Reasons for current admissions: Based on her presenting complaints  past medical history  risk factors and preliminary physical examination  she is being suspected of an acute pulmonary embolism. She will need further diagnostic evaluation and management.  Note: This case presents a typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism. An elderly  female patient with risk factors such as atrial fibrillation  long term anticoagulant use  and recent travel fits the most common demographic and risk profile for pulmonary embolism as found in the literature. Medical students can be taught to identify these key presentations and risk factors  and learn about appropriate diagnostic and management strategies.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,30,Patient Information and Overview  Patient: A 68-year-old Caucasian male  Background: Robert  a retired factory worker who has been a regular smoker for the past 35 years and is occasionally active. He lives with his wife in their suburban home.  Past medical history:  - Hypertension (under control with medication) - Type II diabetes (managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications) - A recent history of prolonged immobility due to a left femoral neck fracture that required surgery and a month-long recovery with limited mobility.   Presenting complaint: - Robert presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  which he describes as increasing over the past few hours. - He has also been feeling light-headed and has experienced episodes of quick  sharp chest pain which worsens during deep inspiration.  Current medications: - Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension - Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes - Daily Aspirin 81 mg  Additional note: There is no history of inherited thrombophilia in his family.  This case presentation is based on typical demographic representation. According to literature  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur in all races  ages  and genders. Still  the overall incidence increases with age and is slightly higher in males. Classic risk factors include recent surgery (especially orthopedic)  immobilization  malignancy  and smoking. Clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to sudden death  but common symptoms are dyspnea  chest pain  and syncope. Patients often appear anxious and can have increased heart rate and respiratory rate.  References: - Ford  E. S.  et al. (2007).

Maria has been living a sedentary lifestyle since retirement a few years ago. She is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She spends most of her time sitting or lying down  as she experiences difficulty with mobility due to moderate osteoarthritis in her knees. She also reports intermittent chest pain and mild shortness of breath over the past few months.  Past Medical History: Maria has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago. She also has atrial fibrillation. Her medication regimen consists of metformin for the control of diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and apixaban for atrial fibrillation. She has no known drug allergies. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father died from myocardial infarction at 75.  Key Complaints: Maria has presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden  sharp  and severe chest pain that started two hours ago. She reported that the discomfort started at rest and is worsened by deep breaths. Also  she has been experiencing increasing dyspnea  as well as faintness and lightheadedness. She also reported having a low grade fever. She described the cough as dry and without hemoptysis.     This case offers a clear perspective of an elderly patient who embodies the common risk factors associated with acute pulmonary embolism: advancing age  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  hypertension  diabetes  and atrial fibrillation. The subsequent assessments  diagnoses  and interventions explored through this case can therefore provide medical students with a comprehensive overview of the considerations needed when treating patients with similar profiles.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,32,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Robert Turner Age: 66 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Past Medical History: Mr. Turner is a former smoker with a 20-pack-year history but quit smoking twenty years ago. He has a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension  both of which are well-managed with medications. He has also reported having deep vein thrombosis two years ago during a long flight.  Key Complaints: Mr. Turner came into the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath  which began during his morning walk. He described the shortness of breath as worsening when lying flat and relieved somewhat by sitting upright. He also mentioned experiencing a sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. Additional problems included a persistent cough producing bloody sputum and feeling lightheaded. He denies any recent long-distance travel or prolonged immobility. He also reports not having any fever  night sweats  or recent sick contacts.  Representation: This case was designed with demographic representation in mind. Pulmonary embolism commonly affects the older population and can occur more frequently in patients with certain risk factors such as history of DVT  COPD  and hypertension  as in Mr. Turner's case. The patient's age  ethnicity  and history of smoking were included to reflect commonly identified demographic factors associated with pulmonary embolism risk. According to literature  pulmonary embolism has a slight male predominance and can occur in all races  although it is slightly more common in Caucasians.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,33,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American woman  married  retired high school teacher  living in an urban environment. She is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol use. Her weight is around 85 kg and her height is 5’5” (calculated BMI is 31.9  indicating obesity).  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Hypertension (controlled with medication) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (partly controlled through diet). Additionally  she had a hysterectomy 20 years ago due to uterine fibroids. She recently underwent a total knee replacement 3 weeks ago. Family history dates back to her mother suffering from a stroke at the age of 71.  Key Complaints: The patient presented with sudden-onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  cough  and unexplained anxiety. She also reported lightheadedness and indications of low-grade fever. Symptoms were aggravated with physical activity and slightly relieved with rest.  Context: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is more prevalent amongst individuals of African-American and older age groups. Predisposing factors such as recent surgery (especially orthopedic)  obesity  advanced age  and family history of venous thromboembolism increase the likelihood of PE in this patient.   Subjects of this teaching case scenario can further elaborate the patient’s clinical examination  proposed diagnostics  and appropriate management strategies. The scenario encourages learners to identify early signs of PE in patients with predisposing factors and formulate an appropriate management plan.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,34,Brief Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: Ms. Johnson Age: 57 years Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: High-school teacher  Past Medical History: Ms. Johnson has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She reports having been on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause for three years and also has a family history of coagulation disorders. Ms. Johnson leads a moderately active lifestyle with no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 31  placing her in the 'obese' category according to standard charts. She also has history of hypertension.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Johnson presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of breathlessness  chest pain  and light-headedness. She explained that the chest pain intensifies with deep breaths and has been ongoing for the last couple of hours. She also noticed streaks of blood while coughing.  This case report was designed based on epidemiological data suggesting that pulmonary embolism often affects older adults  being most common among those aged 60 years and above. Higher rates of PE are also associated with the female gender  specifically postmenopausal women on hormonal therapies. African American ethnicity  obesity  hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle are also considered potential risk factors. Furthermore  individuals who have suffered a DVT or have a family history of coagulation disorders are especially at risk.

This case is designed specifically to include recognized risk factors correlated with pulmonary embolism  including age  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  pre-existing cardiac conditions (atrial fibrillation)  hereditary risk  hypertension and male gender. It should highlight the existing comorbidities and help kick-start a discussion about preventive measures  appropriate diagnostic tests  and acute management strategies for patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,36,Patient Case:  Patient Information: - Name: Jaqueline Smith (Pseudonym)  - Age: 65  - Gender: Female  - Race: African American  - Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well controlled on medication (lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively). She is overweight with a BMI of 32 and has a 10-year history of smoking  but quit five years ago. She has no known allergies. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases; her father had an MI at the age of 72 and her older sister had a stroke at the age of 68.  Key Complaints: The patient presented at the emergency department with sudden-onset shortness of breath that had begun approximately 3 hours prior  describing it as an 'inability to get enough air.' Accompanying her breathlessness  she reported sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsened on deep inspiration. The patient also mentioned a sense of anxiety and feeling faint. She denied any recent prolonged immobility or surgeries  cough  hemoptysis  leg swelling  or recent travel.   Rationale for Case Demographics: This case portrays a patient at higher risk for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) based on documented demographic trends in literature. The patient's age falls into higher risk bracket as incidence of PE increases with age  especially after age 60. Secondly  there's a slightly higher prevalence in females due to risk enhancing factors like pregnancy and oral contraceptive use  although the patient is past menopause  she has other risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking. Lastly  African Americans reportedly have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism as compared to other racial groups. The clinical picture incorporates the common symptoms of acute PE such as dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and light-headedness. The case also subtly alludes to less common  contributory risk factors including obesity  a family history of cardiovascular diseases  and a past history of smoking.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,37,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Patient X is a 63-year-old African American woman residing in a suburban area. She is currently retired and prior to retirement  her occupation was teaching in a local elementary school. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives with her husband and owns a pet cat.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history includes hypertension and type II diabetes  both of which are well managed with medications. She had an open cholecystectomy 11 years ago. She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; her father passed away from a stroke  and her elder brother suffers from coronary artery disease. She had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis 3 years ago but declined any surgical intervention. She has no known allergies.   Key Complaints: Patient X booked an appointment presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain that got worse with deep breathing  and low-grade fever that started a day ago. She also reported feeling light-headed and anxious. The chest pain is pleuritic in nature and is located in the mid-portion of the chest. Patient also complained about minor cough with slight hemoptysis. There is no history of trauma or injury to the chest.  The above case report is consistent with a high pretest probability for acute pulmonary embolism with its common risk factors such as her age  race  and history of prolonged immobilization due to osteoarthritis. Other contributing factors to consider include her history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and familial history of cardiovascular diseases. The light-headedness can be attributed to hypoxemia or anxiety. The hemoptysis  although minor  increases the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,38,Case Report – Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: A 57-year-old African American female  who is a non-smoker  presents to the emergency department. She works as an elementary school teacher  is a mother of two adult children  and lives with her husband. She admits to a sedentary lifestyle  little physical activity  and occasional long flights for holidays.  Past Medical History: Known hypertensive for 10 years on chronic medication. She reports compliance with her hypertension management. Her mother had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her later years. The patient underwent a total right hip replacement 5 years ago without complications. Her body mass index (BMI) is 30 indicating obesity.  Key Complaints: She presents with sudden-onset  sharp  right-sided chest pain  which gets worse on deep inspiration  accompanied by shortness of breath. She also reports feeling lightheaded and having passed small amounts of red  jelly-like sputum earlier today. Additionally  she has experienced intermittent  low-grade fever for the past 2 days. She reports having returned from a long-haul flight three days ago  after visiting her children in Australia.  Note: According to the literature  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is more common in African Americans than Caucasians. Risk factors for PE include prolonged immobilization (such as long-haul flights)  surgery  obesity  hypertension  and a family history of DVT or PE. Symptomatology  like in our patient  might include pleuritic chest pain  dyspnea  hemoptysis  and fever. This use-case scenario is only a common representation and PE can affect individuals regardless of their race  age  gender  or ethnicity.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,39,"Case Report: Acute Pulimentary Embolism  Patient Information: Name: Mrs. Maria Garcia Age: 67 years old Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latina Occupation: Retired Living Situation: Lives with husband in suburban area  Past Medical History: - History of Hypertension for the past 12 years  managed with medication. - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 10 years ago  controlled with diet and Metformin. - Former smoker  quit 7 years ago. - Underwent a total knee replacement surgery 5 weeks ago; on prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (stopped a week after surgery).  Presenting Complaints: - Sudden onset of breathlessness for the past few hours. - Moderate to severe central chest pain that is worse on deep inspiration. - Feeling light-headed and reports episodes of dizziness. - Episodic palpitations with intermittent 'racing' of the heart. - No history of cough  fever  or contact with TB patients.  The demographics and past medical history for Mrs. Garcia were deliberately chosen to reflect the most at-risk patients for acute pulmonary embolism (PE). These include advanced age  history of surgery (especially joint replacement)  conditions that increase blood clot risk like hypertension and diabetes  and former smoking. Literature shows that PE occurs more frequently in women than men and that Hispanic/Latina women are the most affected racial/ethnic group.  This case report seeks to enforce how important it is to consider PE in patients with sudden dyspnea  chest pain  or unconsciousness  especially if they have risk factors like recent surgery or immobility. The symptoms presented by Mrs. Garcia are classically linked to PE  but it's important to remember that PE is a """"great imposter"""" and can be misdiagnosed unless considered."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,40,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics:  Patient Name: Mr. Alan Brown  Age: 72  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Location: Urban.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and obesity. He recently underwent a hip replacement surgery 5 weeks ago. He has been on bed rest and limited physical activity in the recovery phase post-surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension and mild heart failure for which he takes Losartan and Furosemide respectively. He has a known allergy to Penicillin and does not smoke  drink or use recreational drugs.  Key Complaints on Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain  and light-headedness. The chest pain gets aggrevated with deep breathing. He also reports a cough producing blood-tinged sputum. He says that all symptoms started rather abruptly while he was sitting and watching television. The patient also expressed that he's been feeling more fatigued than usual over the past few days.  These symptoms suggest Acute Pulmonary Embolism which is commonly seen after orthopedic surgeries especially in older  obese patients with limited mobility. Furthermore  COPD and heart failure are risk factors for Pulmonary Embolism. This case creates an optimal scenario to teach medical students regarding the risk factors  presenting symptoms  diagnostic workup  and treatment strategies for Acute Pulmonary Embolism  demanding urgent medical attention due to potential life-threatening consequences.  
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,41,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Maria Gonzalez  Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Residential Location: Urban  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Gonzalez has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with the episode being reported three years back. She was on anticoagulation therapy but stopped compliance due to the fear of bleeding complications. Mrs. Gonzalez is a Type II diabetic for the past 12 years under oral medication  and has a history of obesity with a Body Mass Index of 32. Her conditions are known to increase her risk of developing venous thromboembolism  including pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Gonzalez visited the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath which she rated as 8 points out of 10 on the intensity scale. The shortness of breath is associated with chest pain described as a pressure-like pain on the right side of her chest; also aggravated by deep breathing. She is also experiencing mild hemoptysis. She shares that her symptoms appeared suddenly when she was gardening at her home.  Secondary Complaints:  Patient also reported dizziness and fatigue which might have resulted from her insufficient oxygen supply due to pulmonary embolism.   The case represents a typical acute pulmonary embolism case in an elderly female patient with risk factors like past history of DVT  diabetes  and obesity. As per literature  the incidence of PE is higher in individuals over 60 and in those with pre-existing health conditions. Females tend to have higher lifetime-risk due to factors such as pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives  however  the difference is not significant enough to deter from diagnosing PE in males. In terms of race/ethnicity  anyone regardless of ethnicity can experience PE  though some studies suggest slightly higher rates among Caucasians and African Americans than among Hispanics. The patient’s symptoms of sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  hemoptysis  dizziness and fatigue are all common symptoms related to PE. The selected case is relatable for students and can provide a realistic learning scenario.    Reference:  1. Heit JA. Epidemiology of venous thromboembolism. Nat Rev Cardiol. 2015;12(8):464-474. 2.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,42,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:   Ms. Jasmine Edwards is a 62-year-old African-American female  retired school teacher  residing at Montrose Avenue  Chicago  Illinois. She is non-smoker and non-alcoholic  and practices a moderately active lifestyle.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Edwards has Type II Diabetes which has been controlled with Biguanides for the past 8 years. She also has mild Hypertension managed with Beta Blockers. Furthermore  she has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treated medically 5 years ago. She underwent abdominal surgery 3 weeks ago. There is no family history of heart disease or pulmonary embolism (PE).   Key Complaints:  Since the morning  Ms. Edwards has been complaining of sudden onset chest pain  described as 'sharp' and 'stabbing'. Pain severity is said to be increasing with deep breaths. She also reports experiencing shortness of breath since last night which has worsened progressively. Along with this  she also describes a feeling of lightheadedness and an episode of fainting during breakfast.   Rationale:  Typically  the prevalence of PE is higher among African American women  aged 60-69  which guided the establishment of our patient's demographic. Her history of DVT  recent abdominal surgery and type II diabetes  leads to an increased risk factor for PE  as corroborated by various epidemiological studies. The presentation of sudden onset chest pain  breathlessness  lightheadedness and fainting are some of the typical symptoms of an acute pulmonary embolism  making this case apt for training medical students. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,43,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: Mr. Franklin is a 68-year-old African American male  a retired construction worker  currently living alone. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. He is overweight with a BMI of 30.5  recently diagnosed with hypertension  and has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treated five years ago. He is on hypertension controlling medications and has no known allergic reactions to any medication.  Key Complaint: Mr. Franklin was brought to the emergency department by a neighbour as he complained of sudden onset dyspnea and mild pleuritic chest pain. He also stated that he felt lightheaded with episodes of palpitations.  History: He had an orthopedic surgery (knee replacement) 10 days ago. He reports having been relatively immobile since the operation  mostly confining himself to his house. He denies cough  hemoptysis  fever  calf pain or swelling. His father had a history of pulmonary embolism.  Social History: He lives alone and has caregiver support thrice a week. He does not consume alcohol and quit smoking 15 years ago. His diet is often high in fat and he leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Considering the patient’s demographic representation  it matches studies showing PE to be common in individuals over 60  with a slightly higher prevalence in males and African Americans. Risk factors include surgery  immobility  obesity  history of DVT  the personal and family history of PE  and hypertension.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,44,Case Report:  Patient Information: Ms. Barbara Jenkins  a 68-year-old African-American woman.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia well managed on medication. No history of surgery  trauma  or immobilization. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumer. Family history shows father died of a stroke and mother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   Presenting Complaint: The patient arrived at the Emergency Department presenting with sudden onset shortness of breath that started approximately 2 hours ago. She also complained of chest pain  described as a 'sharp' pain on the left side  worsening on deep inspiration. She also mentioned feeling light-headed but denied any cough  fever  hemoptysis  or leg pain.   Significance: Given the sudden onset  the symptoms might suggest an acute pulmonary embolism. The demographic representation acknowledges that pulmonary embolisms are slightly more common in African-Americans compared to Caucasians and also more common in women over the age of 60. The case also demonstrates that pulmonary embolism can occur without obvious risk factors such as immobility or recent surgery  contributing to its often-missed diagnosis.    The patient represents acute pulmonary embolism presentation in the absence of deep vein thrombosis symptoms or evident risk factors  showing how such cases often pose diagnostic challenges. The case's focus on lack of recent immobilization or surgical history aims to show learners that risk stratification tools must not be utilized in isolation. This case is conducive for learners to explore diagnostic approaches  clinical decision rules  and appropriate investigations for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,45,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  The patient is a 63-year old African-American female named Mrs. Jiya. She is retired now but used to work as an English lecturer at a renowned university. She is a widow and lives alone in suburban Detroit  Michigan. Mrs. Jiya has two children who live out of state but visit her frequently.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Jiya has a documented history of hypertension for the last ten years. Her blood pressure has been managed well with anti-hypertensive medication. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus recently diagnosed three years ago. In terms of family history  her mother died from breast cancer at 70 years of age and her father from a stroke at 75. She does not smoke or consume alcohol  and her body mass index falls in the normal range. However  she lives a sedentary lifestyle and prefers staying indoors  reading or watching television.   Key Complaints:  Mrs. Jiya presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain that developed suddenly whilst she was reading. She describes it as a sharp pain in the center and left side of the chest  rating it an 8 out of 10. The pain worsened when she took deep breaths and with lying down. She also mentioned progressively experiencing shortness of breath even while doing small activities that she has never had trouble doing before  such as washing dishes and climbing stairs. There is no associated cough  fever  or any history of trauma.   She felt light-headed and experienced a near syncopal episode but did not lose consciousness. She was also incredibly anxious and had a sense of impending doom. There was no associated nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. There was no radiation of pain to the arms  jaw  back  or neck.   Please note: Acute pulmonary embolism can present differently in patients across demographics  with a high prevalence among African-Americans in the older age group. Such variables might affect case representation  but it is advised to present an array of cases covering diverse patient backgrounds. This broadens one's clinical acumen and ethnocultural competence. The history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  coupled with a sedentary lifestyle  increases the risk factor for the development of an embolic incident.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,46,Case Report: Patient Profile  Name: Mr. Williams Age: 67 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American (As per research  pulmonary embolism occurs in around 26 to 69 per 100 000 in African Americans).  Background: Mr. Williams is a retired school teacher  residing with his wife in a suburban city. He has a loving family of two children and three grandchildren. He used to be an active smoker for about 20 years  but quit 10 years ago  and maintains moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Hypertension  chronic type 2 diabetes  and a past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  for which he had taken anticoagulant therapy for 6 months.  Key Complaints: He presented at the emergency department complaining of chest pain that started suddenly a few hours prior  and has been getting worse. It’s a sharp  stabbing pain that gets worse with deep breaths. He also complains of shortness of breath  rapid breathing  cough  and light-headedness. He also noticed blood in his sputum. Mr. Williams also reported a swollen  painful right calf muscle. He denies any recent trauma  travel  surgery  or periods of immobility.  On examination  his heart rate was high (tachycardia)  blood pressure slightly elevated  respiratory rate increased  and oxygen saturation dropped to 90% on room air. Physical examination revealed tenderness and mild swelling in his right calf.  This case of Mr. Williams  a 67-year-old African American male with significant risk factors such as past history of DVT  hypertension  diabetes  long years of smoking presents classic symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism should be a poignant reminder for every student of the significance of quick identification and management of this serious condition.     Note: This case study is a simulated situation summarizing the typical characteristics and presentation of an acute pulmonary embolism patient. Despite this  every clinical case can be unique due to the variable nature of medicine. Always consider individual patient factors e.g. demographics  history. It's a good idea to expose students to a variety of case scenarios to improve their critical thinking and decision-making skills when handling patients.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,47,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 80 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a previous medical history of deep vein thrombosis post knee replacement surgery three years ago. The patient is also known to suffer from hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He is a former smoker with a pack history of 30 years. The patient is obese with a BMI of 32.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith arrived in the emergency room complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing that began a few hours earlier. The chest pain was sharp  localized on the right side of the chest  and intensified with deep breaths. He also reported feeling light-headed and a racing heart. He stated that over the week  he also noticed swelling  redness  and some discomfort in his right calf  but did not seek medical assistance then.   Medical Statistics and Demographics:  Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) mainly affects older adults  with the median age of patients being about 70 years. Risk factors for PE include surgery  immobilization  malignancy  prior venous thromboembolism  and advanced age. While PE can be seen across all races and ethnicities  studies have hinted at a marginally increased incidence in Caucasians. Males and females are equally affected. Long-term smoking and obesity are both significant risk factors. Furthermore  over 50% of those with PE will have deep vein thrombosis.   This case has been designed with an attempt to provide an optimal mix of diverse risk factors for PE  including age  gender  race  obesity  surgery  and smoking history.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,48,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American female. She is a retired tutor  married  and living with her husband. Her socioeconomic status is middle-class. She is 5'5"""" and weighs 200 pounds  which classifies her as obese (BMI 33.3).  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled by medication. She is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. The patient has no known drug allergies. Her medications consist of losartan for hypertension and metformin for diabetes mellitus. She also disclosed that she is sedentary  engaging in minimal physical activities.  Key Complaints: The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that got worse with deep breathing  and a feeling of faintness that started roughly 2 hours ago. She also mentioned experiencing intermittent rapid heart rate. She denies having any cough  fever  or recent travels. Closer inquiry by the attending physician revealed that the patient recently underwent an elective knee replacement surgery three weeks prior to her current visit.  Case Design: This case is designed to reflect accurate demographic representation found in literature for patients with acute pulmonary embolism(PE). Considering the patient's recent orthopedic surgery  her sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and older age  this patient is at a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common cause of PE. By dispelling the myth that PE only happens to patients on long flights or those with inherited bleeding disorders  students will learn the importance of considering PE in a wider demographic group.  Learning goals for this training case include recognizing the signs and symptoms of acute PE  understanding the risk factors  as well as the necessity of immediate treatment. Furthermore  students will learn about the importance of the smart use of diagnostic tests  application of clinical decision rules  and prophylaxis for DVT and PE in at-risk populations. The training case will tackle each of these aspects as they engage with this case.  References: Zhai  Z.  Kan  Q.  Li  W.  Qin  X.  Qu  J.  & Zhu  J. (2019).

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,49,Case Report:  Patient Description: Mr. Harris  a 69-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department.  Past Medical History: Mr. Harris is a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago  with a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and hypertension. He had a knee replacement surgery two weeks ago and has been relatively immobile since then. He is on bronchodilators for his COPD  an ACE inhibitor for his hypertension  and has been following an anticoagulation prophylaxis regimen post-surgery. He acknowledges a family history of deep vein thrombosis.  Key Complaints: Mr. Harris reports sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens on deep inspiration  and a sense of feeling unwell which started a few hours prior. He also mentions a recent cough producing blood-streaked sputum. He denies fever  sweating or loss of consciousness.   Rationale for Demographic choice:   Based on literature  age is a significant risk factor for Pulmonary Embolism  with cases increasing after 60 years of age.  African American racial background has been associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The historical data of smoking  COPD  recent surgery  immobility  hypertension and positive family history allows for the critical discussion of risk factors of pulmonary embolism. Coughing up blood-streaked sputum can be suggestive of more severe disease.   This case presents a patient with complex intersection of multiple risk factors  providing rich material for trainees. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,50,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics: Name: Ms. Stephanie Torres Age: 56 years Sex: Female Occupation: Part-time legal assistant Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Urban area  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of chronic hypertension (HTN)  hyperlipidemia (HLD)  and type II diabetes mellitus (DM2) which are fairly well-controlled with medications (lisinopril  atorvastatin  and metformin  respectively). She underwent hip replacement surgery 2 weeks prior  after which she was immobile for a prolonged period of time. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Her family history reveals that her mother had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her late 50s.  Key Complaints: Ms. Torres presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain which intensified on deep inspiration. She also reported feeling lightheaded and having episodes of palpitations. Her symptoms started abruptly while she was sitting in her office.  Based on the literature  acute pulmonary embolism is often seen in individuals aged 40-60 years old. Pulmonary embolism can occur in both men and women  but it is more frequently reported in women  especially having recent surgery or prolonged immobility as risk factors. Caucasian ethnicity has a higher incidence of PE when compared to other ethnicities. Other predisposing factors often include conditions that increase coagulability such as cancer  use of oral contraceptives  smoking  obesity  and certain genetic conditions.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,51,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  - Name: Mr. David - Age: 65 years - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired  used to work in a sedentary job - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Marital Status: Married  lives with his wife - History of Smoking: 30 Pack Years - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate  - Other risk factors: Long flights in the recent past  obesity (BMI 32)  and recent surgery for hernia repair  Past Medical History: Mr. David has a history of hypertension that is fairly controlled on medications. Apart from hypertension  he also has well controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He'd been on hormone therapy for localized prostate cancer for the past year. Additionally  he had a successful hernia repair procedure 6 weeks ago. He's been bedridden during the post-operative period and his physical activity has been curtailed. He has no known drug allergies.  Key complaints:  Mr. David presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that started about an hour ago. He vaguely described the chest pain as 'sharp' and 'stabbing'  radiating to the left shoulder. He rated his pain as an 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. Accompanying these symptoms  he also complained of mild dizziness but denied any confusion  palpitations  cough  hemoptysis or fever. His wife noticed that he looked pale and anxious.  Summary:  This case presents a 65-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  prostate cancer  recent surgery  prolonged immobility and significant smoking history. His key complaints are acute onset incessant chest pain  breathing difficulty  and dizziness. This clinical scenario should raise high suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism  particularly in context of his multiple risk factors. This case will help medical students understand presenting symptoms  differential diagnosis and early management of acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,52,Case Report - Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:   Ms. Janet  a 72-year-old African American woman living independently. She has recently relocated from southern rural Alabama to Chicago  Illinois to be closer to her daughter.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Janet has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Her primary care doctor recommended lifestyle changes for hyperlipidemia  including diet and exercise. For hypertension and diabetes  she's taking lisinopril and metformin  respectively. She quit smoking ten years ago but was a heavy smoker for 30 years. She has no known allergies.  Key Complaints:  Over the past couple of days  Ms. Janet reported a sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsened with deep breathing. She also complained of mild shortness of breath and unexplained fatigue she initially attributed to moving stress. When symptoms didn't resolve  her daughter brought her to the hospital.  Take into account Demographic Representation:  Diverse gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are represented in this case. Acute pulmonary embolism can affect anyone  but the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)  is known to be higher in African American population. Additionally  VTE incidence increases with age  and it's more common in women overall due to risk factors such as pregnancy and hormonal birth control. Though not exclusive  these factors should be considered in training  promoting more accurate and comprehensive understanding for the students.   Medical educators should emphasize this information during reviewing this case with medical students  pointing out the clinical presentation  risk factors  relevant physiology and pathophysiology  prompt diagnosis  and comprehensive management of acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,53,Patient Case:  Patient Initials: BK   Age: 66 years   Gender: Race: Female  African American   Occupation: Retired Teacher   Past Medical History: Hypertension  Obesity  Deep Vein Thrombosis after a long-haul flight 6 years ago (on anticoagulant therapy for 6 months post-event)  Presenting Complaints: Sudden onset of Shortness of Breath  Sharp/Crushing Chest Pain  and Dizziness. The patient complained of a sudden acute breathlessness about two hours prior to the hospital visit. She also referred to having mild chest discomfort  which has intensified over the past hour.   Physical Examination: Tachypneic with respiratory rate of over 22 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  Cyanosis in extremities  High body mass index (BMI 32)  [Note: The demographic factor of a 66-year-old African American female was chosen because studies show that pulmonary embolism is more common in individuals over the age of 60  and African Americans have a significantly higher incidence rate compared to their white counterparts. Obesity is a known risk factor for venous thromboembolism  including pulmonary embolism. A history of DVT also increases susceptibility.]   Reference:  White RH  Keenan CR. Effects of race and ethnicity on the incidence of venous thromboembolism. Thromb Res. 2009;123 Suppl 4:S11-S17. doi:10.1016/S0049-3848(09)70136-7 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,54,Case Report - Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Residence: Urban setting  Past Medical History:  - Chronic hypertension controlled with Lisinopril - Type-II diabetes  managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. - Hypothyroidism managed with Levothyroxine. - Ex-smoker (Quit 15 years ago). - No history of thrombotic events. - No known allergies.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the ER with a sudden onset of shortness of breath which has been happening for the past 5 hours. The shortness of breath is associated with a sharp  pleuritic chest discomfort and is aggravated by deep breathing. The patient also reports a feeling of faintness and mild palpitations. No fever  cough  hemoptysis  leg swelling or pain have been reported. She denies any recent long-distance travel  surgery  hospitalization  or immobilization but she does mention that she has been significantly less active in the past month due to a mild ankle sprain that she thought she'd best rest.  Note:  Statistics show that women over the age of 60 are at an increased risk of pulmonary embolism  especially those with a history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle or comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. Caucasian individuals have a higher risk compared to the other races as documented in many population-based studies. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,55,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who works as a long-haul truck driver. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history and a Body Mass Index of 31 indicating obesity. He lives in the Midwest United States.  Past Medical History: Patient X has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and dyslipidemia  all being well controlled with medication. Two years ago  he had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a leg fracture which was treated with anticoagulation therapy. His father died at the age of 72 due to a stroke.  Key Complaints: Patient X presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and mild to moderate chest pain  described as a sharp  stabbing pain  worse on inspiration. He mentions he has been feeling more fatigued over the past few days but thought it was related to extended driving hours. He also reported a dry cough but denied fever  hemoptysis  or leg swelling.  This case report describes a patient who matches demographic factors commonly associated with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Literature suggests that risk increases with age and those with previous history of VTE  such as DVT  are at a higher risk. Smoking and obesity also increase the risk  as does sedentary lifestyle or professions leading to prolonged immobility. This comprehensive patient profile should provide an excellent basis for medical students to learn the typical clinical presentations  risk factors  and potential complications of acute PE.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,56,Patient Case Report:  Patient Initials: J.K. Age: 68 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Accountant Location: Urban  Presenting Complaints: J.K. has been experiencing sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain specifically upon deep inhalation  rapid heart rate  and a sudden feeling of dizziness leading to fainting in the last two days.  Past Medical History: J.K. has a medical history suggestive of hypertension and high cholesterol levels managed with medications. He underwent a right knee replacement surgery 10 days ago. He reports compliance with his medications which include antihypertensives and statins. His family history reveals his father suffered a Venous ThromboEmbolism (VTE) incident in his late sixties. He has never smoked but is overweight with a BMI of 29. No history of alcohol or drug misuse.  Key features: 1. Recent Surgery: J.K.'s recent knee surgery makes him a higher risk candidate for DVT which can lead to Pulmonary Embolism as immobilization post major orthopedic surgery is a well-established risk factor.  2. Advanced Age  Male  Overweight  and Caucasian: All of these increase the chances of a VTE. As per literature  older age and male gender are associated with higher pulmonary embolism incidence. Obesity  found in about one-third of PE patients  increases the risk of VTE  further more prevalent in Caucasians. 3. Symptoms: Shortness of breath  chest pain aggravated by insufflation indicative of deep lung disorders  and sudden fainting all suggest a possible PE. 4. Family history of VTE: Genetic factors could contribute to the higher risk.  In this case  J.K. appears to be suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism based on symptomatology  risk factors  and family history. Applying this case  medical students can gain a better understanding and a practical insight into the presentation  risk factors  and demographics of cases seen in acute pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,57,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. Kenneth Rodriguez is a 60-year-old Hispanic male from an urban setting  residing alone in his apartment. He is married but currently lives separately from his wife. Worked in construction but is now retired. He is a non-smoker and drinks socially. He is financially stable and does not have any trouble affording medications or healthcare appointments.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a history of chronic hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril) for the past ten years and a recent unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about four weeks ago  treated with Rivaroxaban. Additionally  there is a family history of heart disease in a first-degree relative (his father passed away from a myocardial infarction at 70)  and his mother died due to complications from stroke in her late 70s. He also suffers from mild osteoarthritis  which primarily impacts his mobility and physical activity  causing him to lead a sedentary life.  Presenting Complaints:  Today Mr. Rodriguez presents with a sudden onset of shortness of breath over the past few hours. He also mentions experiencing intermittent chest pain  which he describes as 'sharp' and 'stabbing ' rating it a 7 on a pain scale from 1 to 10. The pain intensifies with deep breathing. This is accompanied by mild light-headedness but no syncope. He denies any recent leg pain  trauma  surgery  or long travel. He reports no history of hemoptysis  cough  or recent sickness. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic.   Note for Educators: This case sets the stage to discuss the risk factors  clinical presentation  emergency evaluation  and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism  sharing critical differential diagnoses and the importance of quick decision making in emergency medicine. Explain the role of thrombolytic therapy when contraindications to anticoagulation exist.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,58,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Ramon Diaz  a 67-year-old Hispanic male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Diaz has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from a few years ago. He recovered fully but didn't take his medication regimen too seriously. He has a history of hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus which remain intermittently managed. He occasionally smokes cigarettes. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: He presents to the emergency department with complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath which started a few hours ago while watching television at home. He describes this as a sensation of """"not getting enough air"""". He also reports experiencing sharp chest pain which is worse on inspiration  a productive cough with blood-tinged sputum  lightheadedness and palpitations. He denies any recent travel  trauma  or surgery but mentions being largely sedentary due to COVID-19 restrictions.  Rationale: This case illustrates the classic presentation of acute pulmonary embolism. The patient's age  sex  and ethnicity are selected based on medical literature that suggests pulmonary embolism most frequently occurs in individuals between 60 and 70 years of age  tends to be more common in males  and impacts all racial and ethnic groups. The inclusion of past medical history of DVT  hypercholesterolemia  type 2 diabetes  and smoking portrays well-documented risk factors for thromboembolic disease. The symptoms of shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  hemoptysis  and syncope are all common in pulmonary embolism but vary greatly in their occurrence. This case could serve as a valuable tool to educate medical students on the importance of recognising and quickly responding to this potentially life-threatening condition  with an emphasis on key clinical presentations and risk factors.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,59,Patient Identification: Mrs. Jolene Banks Age: 66 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: Mrs. Banks is a former smoker  who quit 30 years ago. She has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are under control with medication (lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively). She has no known drug allergies. She had a left total hip replacement five weeks ago and has been relatively immobile since then  due to post-operative pain.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Banks presents to the emergency department experiencing sudden onset shortness of breath which started several hours ago. Associated symptoms include mild chest discomfort  fatigue  and a feeling of lightheadedness. There is no history suggestive of fever  chest pain  cough  hemoptysis  or lower limb swelling.  Important Note: This case has been designed to reflect the demographic representation found in medical literature. Women over the age of 60  particular those with a history of major surgery or prolonged immobility  are known to be at increased risk for developing acute pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  representatives of the Caucasian race have a higher risk of developing a venous thromboembolism compared to people of other races. The commonest symptom of pulmonary embolism is unexplained dyspnea  as presented in Mrs. Banks' case. Her previous hip surgery and immobility combined with her other risk factors such as age  gender  and race  make her high risk for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,60,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Margaret Browne  Age: 68 years  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Suburban  Past Medical History: Mrs. Browne was diagnosed with a DVT in her left leg approximately 3 years ago for which she was treated and has had no recurrence. She has a documented history of hypertension  managed with diet and oral medication (Lisinopril). She had an episode of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about three years ago. Her body mass index (BMI) of 29 puts her in the overweight category and she admits to living a relatively sedentary lifestyle  with limited physical activity. She has been a non-smoker for the past 20 years.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Browne arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of sudden onset of breathlessness for the past 2 hours. Additionally  she reported chest pain  which increased in intensity upon deep inspiration. The chest pain was retrosternal and she rated it as 7 on a pain scale of 10. She also mentioned feeling mild dizziness and broke into a sweat while climbing stairs at her home.  Notes: Research suggests that female patients  aged above 60  with a history of DVT and high BMI  have an elevated risk of pulmonary embolism. In teaching this case  emphasize the importance of these risk factors and the corresponding clinical presentation to improve diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore  the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism might differ in elderly patients; keep this into consideration during the discussion of the case. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,61,Case Report:  Patient Information  Ms. K  a 70-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department (ED) around 6:00 pm.  Medical History  Ms. K has a past medical history significant for obesity (BMI: 30.5)  hypertension  and type II diabetes mellitus  well controlled with metformin. She had a cholecystectomy 20 years ago and currently complains of chronic knee osteoarthritis for which she prefers to manage with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She is a non-smoker and discloses moderate (social) alcohol use. Her mother died at age 75 due to complications following a stroke  and her father died at age 80 of lung cancer although he was a lifelong non-smoker.   Presenting Complaint  Ms. K contacted emergency medical services earlier in the day  stating she had sudden onset of shortness of breath while sitting and watching television. She also reports mild to moderate  sharp  nonradiating substernal chest pain. Pain is exacerbated on inspiration and does not change with position. She denies any recent leg pain or swelling. She mentions experiencing a “racing heart” but denies dizziness  syncope  or pre-syncope. She does not currently take oral contraceptives or any form of hormonal therapy. There has been no recent travel or hospitalizations  though she had a minor car accident about a month ago with no perceived injuries.   Ms. K’s acute symptoms  coupled with her risk factors like obesity and sedentary lifestyle  increase the suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The objective of this case study is to train the medical students on how to evaluate  diagnose  and manage a patient with suspected acute PE. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,62,Patient Demographics: Patient is a 68-year-old African American woman  retired teacher  nonsmoker  currently residing in an urban area. She is a widow who lives alone but has a caregiver who assists her regularly.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  obesity (BMI: 32 kg/m2)  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently  she underwent total hip replacement surgery on the right side.  Chief Complaints: The patient came to the Emergency Department with increasing shortness of breath  chest pain (described as a sharp  stabbing pain that worsens with deep breaths)  and unexplained anxiety.   Rationale: According to the literature  pulmonary embolism is more frequent in the elderly population  with the average age of patients being approximately 60 years old. Women tend to have a slightly higher risk than men. Racial differences in pulmonary embolism also exist. African Americans have been shown to be at a significantly higher risk than Caucasians. Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  diabetes  and surgery  especially hip or knee replacement  are well-documented risk factors for the development of pulmonary embolism. Hypertension is not a direct risk factor for PE but is mentioned here as it is a common comorbidity in this age group. The key symptoms of pulmonary embolism  such as shortness of breath  chest pain  and anxiety  have been incorporated into the case.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,63,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Jones Age: 65 years Race: Caucasian Sex: Female Occupation: Retired schoolteacher  Past Medical History: Mrs. Jones has a significant past medical history. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  followed by Hypertension 7 years ago. Both conditions are currently well-controlled with medication. Five years ago  she was diagnosed with right-sided breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy  followed by chemotherapy and radiation. She has been in remission for the past 3 years. Mrs. Jones also had a total hip replacement surgery approx. 1 month ago due to osteoarthritis.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Jones visited the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsened upon deep breathing  and a sense of anxiety. She also reported experiencing a fainting episode early in the morning and noticed her heart rate was faster than usual.  Demographics Consideration: The demographic representation in this case was decided based on literature which suggests that pulmonary embolism is more common in elderly patients  especially women  following surgery  cancer history  or those with prolonged immobility. Pulmonary embolism is also prevalent among patients with Hypertension and Diabetes which is represented in the patient's past medical history.  Note to Students: Consider the patient's recent hip surgery  prolonged immobility  and history of cancer as potential risk factors for her current presentation of symptoms. An understanding of the patient's past medical history is crucial as it can help identify high risk patients for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,64,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Ms. Martina Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female. She lives in urban Texas and is a retired school teacher.  Past medical history: Martina has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  well controlled with medication. She recently underwent a total knee arthroplasty about two weeks ago. She was a former tobacco user  having quit 20 years ago  and consumes alcohol occasionally with no history of drug abuse. Family history reveals that her father died of myocardial infarction at 75  and her mother died of stroke at 81.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Lopez presents to the ER with sudden onset shortness of breath and a sharp  stabbing pain in her chest  worse with deep breaths. She also mentions that she had been feeling slightly light-headed for the past couple of hours  which she initially attributed to her medications. She denies any cough  fever  or leg edema.  The sudden onset of her symptoms  history of recent surgery  and her past medical history should raise concerns among medical students about a possible acute pulmonary embolism. This hypothetical case will help student to understand the risk factors  presenting symptoms  and the urgent need for diagnosis and treatment of potential acute pulmonary embolism.   This demographic representation  including age  race  and geographic location  takes into account the significantly higher prevalence rates of PE among the elderly  Hispanic ethnicity (NHANES study)  and urban dwellers (due to sedentary lifestyle)  with the combined effect of comorbidities and recent surgery.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,65,Case Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle Aged Woman  Patient Information: Name: Mrs. A Sex: Female Age: 53 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Physical Education Teacher Location: Metropolitan neighborhood  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for the past five years  under control with medication. 2. Known case of obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m^2. 3. Varicose veins diagnosed 3 years back. 4. Mild asthma as a child  no flare-ups in adult life. 5. Non-smoker and occasional alcohol drinker. 6. No known drug allergies.  Chief Complaints: 1. Sudden onset shortness of breath for a duration of the past few hours. 2. Sharp chest pain that seems to worsen with deep breaths 3. Rapid heartbeat since the onset of chest pain and shortness of breath.  Additional Comments: Acute pulmonary embolism appears to be more common in older people  with Caucasians appearing to be at a higher risk. Also  contributors like hypertension  obesity  and varicose veins can increase the potential for clot formation. Asthma isn't a risk factor for pulmonary embolism  but we can use this aspect of the patient's history to explore differential diagnoses and ensure students don't get sidetracked.  Please note that these are generalized assumptions for the purpose of creating a representative case study and individual cases can significantly differ based on multiple factors impacting patient's health.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,66,Case Report:  Patient Information:   A 65-year-old African American man  retired construction worker  from an urban area.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was not compliant with his anticoagulation medication. He also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and Controlled Hypertension. He is an active smoker with a 30 pack-year history and occasionally consumes alcohol. He is married  lives with his wife  has a son who's living abroad  and reports experiencing intermittent periods of moderate stress.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain that commenced a couple of hours prior to admission while he was involved in mild physical activity (gardening). The dyspnea has progressively worsened  and is now accompanied by light-headedness and a fainting spell. The patient also reports recent calf pain and swelling which he initially attributed to his construction work related injuries.  Additional Information:  His vitals at presentation are: BP- 150/90 mmHg  Pulse- 110 bpm  RR- 22 breaths/min  Temp- 98.6 F  O2 Saturation- 92% on room air. On examination  the patient appears acutely distressed. He's mildly tachypneic  with decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung fields and mild calf swelling is noted.   Given his symptoms  previously known DVT  absent anticoagulation  and his risk factors of smoking and advancing age  acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is highly suspected. Appropriate imaging investigations like a CT scan should be ordered immediately to confirm the same  alongside standard lab tests including D-dimer  Troponin and BNP levels. Patient should be placed on emergency anticoagulation if there is a high suspicion of PE  even before confirmation by imaging as per current guidelines. The case can then be discussed about various treatment options and long-term risk reduction strategies.    Curriculum areas of learning: Risk factors for PE  Sign and Symptoms of PE  Diagnostic Investigations of PE  Immediate management of suspected PE.   NOTE: In the US  Black and African American individuals reportedly have a 30-60% higher incidence of PE compared to Caucasians. This case upholds demographic representation through the racial  age  smoking  DVT history and non-compliance profile of this 65-year old African American male patient.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,67,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:   Mr. J  a 68-year-old African-American male retiree with a BMI of 30  presents to the emergency department.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a known history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes  which he has been managing with metformin and lifestyle modifications. He has a former smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit 20 years ago.   Key Complaints:  Mr. J presents with sudden-onset  stabbing chest pain that started 2 hours ago. He describes the pain as severe and localized to the middle of his chest  worsened with deep breaths and certain movements. Accompanying the chest pain  he reports experiencing shortness of breath  light-headedness  and a sense of impending doom. He denies any triggers including physical exertion  but mentions he took a 10-hour car trip yesterday.  Literature Support:  This case represents a classic presentation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been designed to reflect the type of individual most commonly affected by this condition (Konstantinides et al.  2019). Although PE can happen to anyone regardless of age  race  or sex  it is most common among older adults  typically over 60 years of age (Wendl et al.  2020). Additionally  several factors increase the risk of PE including obesity  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and prolonged immobility such as long travels (Di Nisio et al.  2016).

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,68,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Information:   Mr. James Mitchell  a 67-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department. He is married and a retired naval officer and currently works part-time as a security consultant. He lives in a suburban community. He's a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Mitchell has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension for which he has been taking medication for the past 7 years. He also had a left total hip replacement surgery a year ago. His family history is significant for venous thrombosis and cardiovascular disease.   Complaints:  Mr. Mitchell presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath that started about 2 hours prior to coming to the hospital. He describes the dyspnea as becoming worse over time  and it is associated with a sharp  stabbing chest pain that is aggravated by deep breathing. He also mentions he has been feeling light-headed and experienced a bout of fainting  after which his wife insisted he comes to the ED.   Note:  For this case  pulmonary embolism is an age-related disease  with an incidence of 0.1% per year for adults aged 35-40 years  increasing to nearly 1% per year by the age of 85 years. The choice of the patient to be an African American man is based on the literature  one such as the study by White et al. (2013)  suggesting a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism among African American individuals compared to Caucasians. The history of orthopedic surgery factors in as it is known to predispose patients to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This case incorporates these findings to offer an accurate demographic representation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,69,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics:   Patient Initials: E.A. Age: 67-year-old  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  E.A. has a known medical history of hypertension  for which she has been on medication for over ten years. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about five years ago  coupled with obesity (BMI=31.2 kg/m2). E.A. is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic.   Key Complaints:  E.A. presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath that started about two hours prior to her arrival. The shortness of breath was associated with moderate to severe chest pain  which she described as ‘stabbing’ in nature and graded at 7/10 in intensity. The pain started when she was walking to her mailbox  and it was worse with deep breaths and not relieved by rest. She also mentioned feeling slightly lightheaded and anxious because of the unexpected onset of these symptoms  but no syncope.  She reported petechial rash on her lower legs which she had noticed a couple of days ago but did not seek medical attention for  thinking it would resolve on its own. She denied any leg swelling or pain  recent surgery  trauma  or long-distance traveling. There was no cough  hemoptysis  night sweats  or weight loss.  Based on the literature  pulmonary embolism is commonly found in the older adult population  and is slightly more prevalent in women than in men. Certain co-morbidities  including obesity and hypertension  increase the risk - as does a personal history of DVT. The sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are classic symptoms. Therefore  this case was designed to reflect common demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,70,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics:   Mr. Daniel Morris  a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 30 working as an office manager. He is a former smoker and has no known drug allergies. He is married with two grown-up children and lives in a suburban area.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of chronic hypertension for the past 10 years being managed with hydrochlorothiazide. He also reports previous diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago  following a long flight  treated with warfarin for 6 months. He doesn't report any family history of coagulation disorders. The patient has had a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Morris presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of difficulty in breathing  chest pain that increased with deep breathing  light-headedness  and cold sweats that started two hours prior to admission. He also reports intermittent dry cough but denies any hemoptysis. He feels a general sense of anxiety and impending doom. His wife noticed his lips were turning slightly blue prompting a rush to the hospital.  The combination of the sedentary lifestyle  a previous incident of DVT  age  and symptoms present a high clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism in Mr. Morris. This case focuses on the importance of proper evaluation  diagnostic approach  and management strategies for acute pulmonary embolism. The case also emphasizes the importance of the prevention strategies in high-risk individuals.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,71,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mrs. Smith  a 68-year-old African-American female  retired school teacher  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - Diagnosed 5 years ago  under treatment 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 3 years ago  under treatment 3. History of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) - Occurred 2 years ago  was treated and on prophylaxis 4. Hyperhomocysteinemia - Diagnosed 10 months ago  Key Complaints: Mrs. Smith presented to the ER with sudden onset difficulty breathing  chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and a cough with hemoptysis noted once. She also reported feeling lightheaded  episodes of dizziness  and an inexplicable sense of anxiety over the past few hours.  Further data reveal Mrs. Smith's recent history of prolonged immobilization following a fractured hip about 4 weeks ago.  The combination of her demographic profile  symptoms and risk factors (specifically her history of DVT  recent immobilization  hypertension  diabetes and hyperhomocysteinemia) raises strong clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism in this case. The medical team is directed to work on the diagnosis and implement an appropriate treatment plan immediately.  With this case  we aim to highlight the importance of clinical judgment  ability to connect patient history with symptoms to make an informed decision  relevance of PE risk factors  and the urgency in managing cases of suspected pulmonary embolism given its high morbidity and mortality rates if left untreated.   Note: The demographic representation of African-American and aged patient mirrors real-world data that suggests higher incidences of hypertension  diabetes  and DVT in this particular population.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,72,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mr. Miguel Rodriguez  a 58-year-old Hispanic male  residing in NYC  is admitted to the Emergency department.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been a smoker for about 30 years but has quit smoking for the last two years. Despite cessation  he still exhibits the signs and symptoms of COPD. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower right extremity 5 years ago  managed with anticoagulants until 3 year ago when it was deemed to have resolved.  Key Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  sounding more like panting  which has been progressing for the last 3 hours. He also reports experiencing a sharp  stabbing chest pain that intensifies with deep inspiration. In addition to these symptoms  he also mentions feeling light-headed  and having bouts of dry cough.  Note: Acute pulmonary embolism is a common condition significantly affecting both Hispanic and African-American populations. Pre-existing conditions like COPD  diabetes  and previous DVT cases can increase the susceptibility for acute pulmonary embolism. This case is presented considering these demographic representation and disease prevalence as found in literature. Please move to the next step of the training case- detailed history-taking  conducting the examination  and further course of actions to diagnose and manage the condition.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,73,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Mr. James Hopkins  a 60-year-old  white male.  Demographics:  Mr. Hopkins is a non-smoker and a retired electrician  living with his wife in the suburbs. He has no known drug or food allergies. He reports moderate alcohol consumption and denies any drug use.  Past Medical History:  He has a known history of chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension  both of which are managed with medications (beta-blocker and aspirin). He has had two prior episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  5 and 2 years ago respectively. No history of cancer or recent surgeries. No family history of cardiovascular diseases or clotting disorders.  Presenting complaints:  Mr. Hopkins seeks emergency care complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath that started an hour ago  which has progressively worsened. He describes the pain as pleuritic in nature  aggravated by deep breathing  and not relieved by rest. He also reports mild chest pain  a recent cough  and he has noticed that his heart feels like it's 'racing'. No reports of fever  hemoptysis or syncope.  The case of Mr. Hopkins directly represents the typical demographic (60 years old  male  Caucasian) and medical history (atrial fibrillation  previous DVT) of a patient at higher risk for developing a pulmonary embolism as described in various literature sources. The presenting symptoms align with the common manifestations of acute pulmonary embolism. This case provides an opportunity for medical students to piece together the history  symptoms  risk factors  and likely diagnosis.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,74,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:   Mr. Antonio Rodriguez  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  presents in the emergency room. He is an accountant by profession with a lifestyle that includes minimal physical activity due to long office hours. Mr. Rodriguez is a non-smoker  and he restricts alcohol consumption to social occasions. He has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:  Known hypertensive for the past 15 years  Mr. Rodriguez has been under the treatment and monitoring of his primary care physician. He also has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  which is also well managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He had an appendectomy in his thirties. His family's medical history includes his father who died at 63 due to heart disease  and his mother is alive and well at 78.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez presented shortness of breath (dyspnea)  which has gradually worsened over the last few days. He also reported feeling chest pain that was sharp and worsened when taking deep breaths. He also mentions occasional episodes of dizziness  and he had a single episode of hemoptysis at home which led him to come to the ER. He denies any recent long-distance travel or immobilization. He also denies leg pain or swelling.  Objective findings:  Vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate 108/min) and slight tachypnea (22 breaths/min). He is afebrile. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical examination reveals a well-oriented man in respiratory distress. He's slightly overweight with a BMI of 28. He has bilateral clear lung fields with no leg swelling. ECG shows sinus tachycardia but otherwise unremarkable. D-dimer test was positive.   This case fits within the epidemiology of PE which appears to be most common in those aged 60–70 years  and with high risk from underlying diseases particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea (shortness of breath)  chest pain  and hemoptysis; signs usually include tachypnea (fast  shallow breathing) and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). It is important to consider PE in the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with these signs  even in the absence of risk factors such as recent surgery  immobilization or air travel. Case should be followed up with chest CT angiography for confirmation and management.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,75,Patient Profile: Name: James Thompson Age: 63 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired High School Physical Education Teacher Living Situation: Lives alone in a suburb  children living in different states  Presenting Complaint: James presents to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden-onset shortness of breath and sharp  central chest pain that came on at rest and has been worsening over the last three hours. The chest pain is pleuritic (worsened by deep inspiration) and is associated with a cough but no hemoptysis.  Past Medical History: James has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a right hip replacement operation 3 years ago. He was on warfarin for a year following the operation but has not been on any medication since. He's a former smoker with a 30-pack year history but quit smoking after his hip surgery. James has a history of morbidity obesity since his retirement but has lost significant weight in the past few years. There is no known history of malignancy or recent prolonged travel. His family history is unremarkable  with no known inheritable blood disorders.   Risk Factors: Given the patient's past history of DVT  obesity  recent orthopedic surgery  former smoking status  and male gender  he is at high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).   This case presents several medical risk factors from real-world studies correlating PE to gender  age  postoperative patients  smokers  and those with obesity. James's demographic details represent a common profile of patients suffering from PE in an attempt to make the case relatable and practical for the medical students.   Additional Information: This medical case is ideal for teaching medical students to differentiate PE from other conditions presenting with similar symptoms such as myocardial infraction  pneumonia  or pleurisy. It also emphasizes the importance of considering a patient's risk factors when diagnosing.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,76,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics:  Patient is a 60-year-old African American male. He is married  a retiree with past occupation as a truck driver. Patient is a nonsmoker and records a moderate consumption of alcohol.   Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. There is also a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago after a long-distance drive. He is not on oral anticoagulants but has been compliant with his diabetes and antihypertensive medications. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease but no known hereditary blood disorders.  Main Complaint: The patient presents in the ER complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath which started a few hours ago and associated with mild chest pain. He reports a recent long-distance road trip.  Comment: The case depicts a patient who is at high-risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to his past history of DVT and recent period of prolonged inactivity (the long-distance road trip). The demographic representation takes into account data from literature that states African American males have higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes.  References: 1. Arya  R.  Barnes  J. A.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,77,Case Scenario:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 58 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Occupation: Construction worker   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson is a lifelong non-smoker who has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago  which was treated with anticoagulation. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His father died due to a sudden heart attack in his early 60s.   Present Complaint: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with acute onset of breathlessness and right-sided chest pain  worse upon deep inspiration  which started a few hours ago. He also mentioned experiencing a low-grade fever from the past one day and had been feeling unusually fatigued recently.   On observation  he appeared anxious and was sweating.   Background & Justification: This scenario primarily targets the diagnosis and management of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  a common  potentially fatal condition with a wide gamut of clinical presentations.  A 58-year-old African-American male was chosen based on the literature showing a higher rate of venous thromboembolism  including PE  among African-Americans. According to the CDC  men are slightly more at risk than women. DVT predisposes to PE  as does a family history of thromboembolic events. The scenario also highlights the relevance of environmental risk factors such as the patient's occupation. It aims to reinforce the lesson that PE should be suspected in patients with risk factors who present with unexplained dyspnea  tachypnea  pleuritic chest pain  or unexplained cough.  The case can further be used to discuss PE's symptoms  physical exam findings  appropriate diagnostic testing  and immediate treatment strategy. Discussions and teaching about long-term management options based on the patient's particular risk factors can also be incorporated. Physicians should also understand how to approach shared decision-making around anticoagulation in the context of this case.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,78,Patient Information: Sophia Martinez  63-year-old Hispanic female  retired elementary school teacher  living with her husband in Los Angeles  California.  Past Medical History: Patient has a documented history of hypertension and deep vein thrombosis in her right calf three years ago. She had undergone Phlebectomy and was prescribed Warfarin  which she had discontinued after a year due to side effects. She is also a long-term smoker (20 cigarettes/day) for the past 40 years but quit 3 years ago after her DVT diagnosis. Further  she is obese (BMI 31) and sedentary.  Presenting Complaints: Patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain started two hours prior. The pain is exacerbated with deep breathing and does not relieve with rest or position changes. She denied any cough  fever  leg pain or swelling  recent surgery  vomiting or diarrhea. She also expressed anxiety worrying it may be a heart attack.   Rationale: This scenario is designed to highlight one of the most serious and common cardiovascular diseases - acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The demographic data (63-year-old Hispanic female) should help address the diversity and inclusion in medical training materials. Mrs. Martinez's risk factors for PE include a history of DVT  obesity  long-term smoking  and sedentary lifestyle. The decision to discontinue Warfarin is common amongst patients who cannot tolerate its side effects and further emphasizes the importance of patient education on drug compliance. Her presenting symptoms are typical of acute PE and should prompt immediate consideration of this diagnosis in order to initiate life-saving treatment. Additionally  the acute onset of symptoms can help students differentiate PE from other respiratory or cardiac diseases.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,79,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Study  Patient Demographics: Name: Ms. Lydia Thompson Age: 66 years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Urban Residential area  Past Medical History: 1. History of deep vein thrombosis three years ago  treated with anticoagulants. 2. Hypertension managed on medication for the past ten years. 3. Ex-smoker - quit smoking five years ago.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Lydia Thompson  a 66-year-old retired school teacher  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain radiating to her left shoulder for the last four hours. The pain is sharp  pleuritic in nature  and exacerbated by deep breathing. She admits to mild hemoptysis and episodes of light-headedness. There is no history of fever  cough  night sweats  or weight loss. She reports that she has been relatively inactive in the past few weeks due to a previous ankle injury causing limited mobility.  Upon examination  she appeared anxious and diaphoretic with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/88 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.  Note: According to the published literature  pulmonary embolisms are more common in women over 50 with a history of deep vein thrombosis  sedentary lifestyle  certain genetic conditions  obesity  certain diseases and conditions  and injury or damage to veins. They can also be seen in those with a history of smoking. This case is meant to reflect a common patient demographic and medical history seen in real-world scenarios of acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,80,Patient Case Report:  Patient Information: Jonathan Brown  67-year-old Caucasian male  retired accountant  living alone.  Chief Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of chest pain  shortness of breath  and mild dizziness that started suddenly since past few hours. He also reported a sense of not feeling well.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has a history of coronary artery disease  type 2 diabetes  and has been a smoker for 20 years with a fairly sedentary life. He had undergone a total right hip replacement surgery five weeks ago. Postoperatively  he was on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for three weeks. There are no known drug allergies.  Physical Examination:  On assessment  he is anxious  diaphoretic  and appears dyspneic. Vitals show blood pressure of 145/85 mm of Hg  pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. His chest examination reveals tachycardia and his lungs are clear to auscultation. No signs of deep vein thrombosis.  This case is designed so that students can identify the high-risk profile scenario of recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle and smoking habit  all contributing to the formation of a potential pulmonary embolism. Students are encouraged to risk-stratify the patient  and discuss diagnostic steps including D-dimer test  pulmonary CT angiography  and ventilation/perfusion scan. Treatment plans and the importance of aggressive prophylactic strategies in post-operative patients should also be discussed.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,81,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: The patient  Mr. J  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired military personnel. He is married  has two children  and currently lives in a suburban community. He doesn't smoke nor drink alcohol. His weight and body mass index are within the normal ranges for his height. He seems to have moderate physical activity.   Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) diagnosed 5 years ago. He was prescribed anticoagulant medication and had been compliant until about 3 months ago when he discontinued the treatment because he felt well. He also has a known case of hypertension  currently under control with medication. His father had a history of pulmonary embolism. He has no known allergies. He does not have a previous history of malignancy  recent surgeries  or prolonged immobilization.  Present Complaints:  Mr. J presents to the Emergency Department with a complaint of sudden-onset  sharp  right-sided chest pain that has been worsening over the last 6 hours. The pain is exacerbated by deep breathing and does not get better with rest. He is also experiencing shortness of breath  light-headedness  and a sense of anxiety. He mentions that he didn’t experience any physical trauma. He denies cough  fever  hemoptysis  or leg pain or swelling.  Upon arrival  his vitals are temperature 98.5°F  blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg  pulse rate 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.  The case has been designed taking into account the high prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the older population (especially over 60 years old)  the recurring factor of patients discontinuing anticoagulation medication  and the risk of PE due to a history of DVT. It is also kept in mind that PE often occurs without any specific symptoms and that the onset is usually sudden. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,82,Patient Information:   63-year-old African-American male  employed as a bus driver. Lives with his wife in an urban setting. History of smoking (30 pack-years) and occasional alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension (controlled) 2. Type 2 Diabetes (controlled on oral medication) 3. Previous deep vein thrombosis (5 years ago)  Present Illness:  The patient reports a sudden onset of shortness of breath that started two days ago. Accompanying symptoms include mild chest pain  which he describes as a sharp pain on the left side which worsens on taking deep breaths. He denies any symptoms of a common cold  fever  or cough. He also reports feeling unusually fatigued and lightheaded in the past couple of days. He has noticed swelling in his left leg  similar to what he experienced during his deep vein thrombosis 5 years ago. He has been feeling anxious due to the breathlessness and associated symptoms.   Differential Diagnoses:   1. Acute pulmonary embolism 2. Pneumonia 3. Acute coronary syndrome 4. Pleurisy 5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation  Literature Note:  Pulmonary embolism frequently occurs in patients over the age of 60  and more frequently in males. Moreover  African-Americans are disproportionately affected by pulmonary embolism  as per the existing literature. Comorbidities most commonly associated with acute pulmonary embolism include hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and previous venous thromboembolism - all of which this typical patient has. High-risk factors such as smoking  obesity  and prolonged immobility (due to his long-hour bus driving job) further add to this patient's risk for acute pulmonary embolism. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,83,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient Demographics: Ms. Ortiz is a 58-year-old Hispanic female from San Antonio  Texas. She is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband  and has three adult children.  Past Medical History: Ms. Ortiz's past medical history is significant for obesity (BMI: 32)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are well-managed with appropriate medications. She had a right knee replacement surgery 2 weeks ago and has been recovering at home. There is no known drug allergy. No previous smoking or alcohol abuse. Reports being compliant with medications.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Ortiz was brought in by her husband to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of sudden onset of breathlessness and chest discomfort over the last 3 hours. She also complained of fainting episodes and light-headedness. Her husband mentioned that she had been more tired than usual since her knee surgery and had reduced mobility.   Potential Pitfalls/Misdiagnosis Considerations: Given Ms. Ortiz's recent surgery and reduced mobility  combined with her symptoms  there is a possibility of misdiagnosis. The subtle symptoms of PE  i.e.  dyspnea  could easily be overlooked in light of more common postoperative complaints  like general fatigue  or attributed to her known comorbidities like obesity or hypertension.  Background Explanation:  The case revolves around a Hispanic woman aged 58 years making it representative considering that the incidence of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is 1.25-times higher among Hispanics and rises with age. The fact that she had a recent surgery  particularly orthopedic  compounds the risk for a venous thromboembolism such as a PE  which is a common postoperative complication. Her comorbidities such as obesity  diabetes  and hypertension are also risk factors for PE.  Objective: This case provides a succinct report on acute pulmonary embolism  prompting students to consider PE with a high index of suspicion particularly in patients with aforementioned risk factors and presenting symptoms. It encourages a deeper understanding of how to evaluate  diagnose  and manage these high-acuity patients  becoming effectively familiar with critical PE presentation nuances.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,84,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John McGraw  a 68-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain radiating to his left arm. Reports feeling dizzy and faint  with a near syncopal episode earlier in the day.  Demographics: Address: Denver  Colorado Occupation: Retired automotive mechanic Marital Status: Widowed Tobacco Use: He is a former smoker  who quit 20 years ago  but had a 30-pack year history before quitting. Alcohol Use: Moderate alcohol drinker  2-3 times a week. Drug Use: No drug use reported.  Past Medical History: Hypertension  Type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 10 years ago.   Medications: Metformin 500 mg twice a day  Lisinopril 20 mg once a day  and Aspirin 81 mg once a day  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: John was found to be in acute distress. He has a respiratory rate of 28/min  heart rate of 110/min  blood pressure of 146/92 mmHg  and blood oxygen saturation at 88% on room air.  Key complaints: 1. Acute onset shortness of breath 2. Acute chest pain radiating to his arm 3. Feelings of dizziness and faintness 4. History of near syncope  Family History:  Father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 74  mother died from stroke at 80. He has two siblings  a brother  aged 70  with hypertension and a sister  aged 64  with diabetes mellitus.   Emergency department considerations: Given the patient's age  gender  race  past medical history  including prior DVT  and presentation including vital signs and symptoms  it is important to consider multiple differential diagnoses  including acute coronary syndrome and acute pulmonary embolism. Due to the nature of the sudden onset and acuteness of the current symptoms  as well as the history of DVT  acute pulmonary embolism would be considered high on the differential.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,85,Case Report  Patient Information: Ms. Eleanor Davis is a 65-year-old African American female from rural Virginia who works as a schoolteacher.  Chief Complaint: “I feel like I cannot catch my breath  and there is a sharp pain in my chest for the past few hours.”  Past Medical History: Ms. Davis has a ten-year history of well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She also suffered a deep vein thrombosis 5 years ago. There is no known drug allergy. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Ms. Davis had surgery (a total knee replacement) 6 weeks ago. Her medications include metformin  lisinopril  low-dose aspirin  and a multivitamin. Her father died of a stroke in his early 70s.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is anxious  diaphoretic  and labored in her breathing. Her Vitals - BP: 146/92 mmHg  PR: 110/min  RR: 24/min  Temp: 98.6 F  O2 Sat: 92% on room air. Her heart: tachycardic  regular rhythm  no murmur. Lungs reveal decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. No edema observed in her legs.  Assessment and Reasoning:  Given her recent surgery  immobilization  history of DVT  the sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath makes an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) a major concern. Her age  race  and underlying chronic conditions further increased her risk for PE. Pulmonary examination findings also suggest possible PE. Observe her rising BP and tachycardia which suggest her body's efforts to compensate for the possible reduced blood oxygen levels.   Immediate intervention should include stabilization of the patient  confirmation of the diagnosis via high-resolution CT angiogram  and initiation of anticoagulation therapy. Informed consent is necessary. The case should prompt students to understand how the patient's demographic  clinical history  and clinical presentation can guide their diagnostic reasoning towards PE.   Note: It is crucial in this case for the students to recognize PE's potential fatality and the need for emergent diagnosis and treatment. They should also be made aware of the contributory risk factors  such as recent surgery and prior history of DVT. Understanding patient demographics  such as the higher prevalence of hypertension in African Americans  they can incorporate those components into their clinical decision-making process.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,86,Patient Case: Mr. David Thompson  a 65-year-old African American male  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of type 2 diabetes under management with metformin for the last eight years. He has also been previously diagnosed with hypertension  which is controlled with lisinopril. His other relevant medical history includes obesity  with a BMI of 32 kg/m2 and hypercholesterolemia which was diagnosed 5 years ago. Mr. Thompson  a former smoker  quit smoking about 10 years ago but had a substantial 30 pack-year history prior to that. He worked as a long-distance truck driver but has been retired for the last five years.  Key Complaint: Mr. Thompson recently returned from a two-week-long cruise trip. Over the past two days  he has been experiencing unusual episode of shortness of breath even on mild exertion such as walking to his mailbox. Initially  he attributed this to his lack of routine exercise. Unfortunately  the breathlessness began to be accompanied by a sharp  stabbing chest pain  particularly worse on deep breathing. He denied any fever  productive cough  night sweats  leg swelling or pain  recent traumas  or surgery. There's no history of blood clot disorders in his family  however  he has been mostly immobile since his cruise trip. Worried by these symptoms  he decided to visit the emergency department.   Rationale: Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) commonly affects people older than 60 years. It has a higher incidence in African American populations compared to others. Risk factors for this case include sedentary lifestyle  recent travel involving long duration of immobility  obesity  hypertension  and prior smoking history. These risks are compounded by co-existing chronic medical conditions including type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Symptoms of PE often include sudden shortness of breath  chest pain particularly during deep breaths  which align with this patient's presentation.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,87,Case Summary: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics:  A 70-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication  underwent a total knee replacement six weeks ago  is an ex-smoker (quit 15 years ago)  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to osteoarthritis. He has no known allergies. There is no family history of coagulation disorders.  Patient Presentation/Complaints:  The patient presents with sudden onset of dyspnea (shortness of breath) and sharp  stabbing chest pain that gets worse upon deep inhale  referred to as pleuritic chest pain. He also reports feeling light-headed and palpitations. On further questioning  the patient reveals that he noticed slight swelling and warmth in his right calf a couple of days ago but didn't pay much attention because the pain was not severe.   Note to Medical Educators:  In terms of demographics  the age  race and gender of the patient are within the range of those who are commonly affected by acute pulmonary embolism. Also  several risk factors for a PE have been incorporated into the past medical history - namely  advanced age  recent surgery (increased risk of embolism due to immobilization)  chronic hypertension  previous smoking  and sedentary lifestyle. The classic presenting symptoms of an acute pulmonary embolism - sudden and unexplained shortness of breath and chest pain activiated by deep breaths - are mentioned as the patient's key complaints. This case  therefore  provides material to help students recognize the symptoms of PE  identify high risk patients  and strategize the need for urgent diagnostic testing. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,88,Case Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-Operative Male Patient  Patient Demographics: Name: John Doe Age: 72 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Marital status: Married Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: 1. Right knee arthroplasty two weeks ago 2. Hypertension controlled well on medication  3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus under control with diet and medication 4. 40 pack-years smoking history  quit 5 years ago 5. 30-year history of hyperlipidemia 6. No previous history of DVT or Pulmonary Embolism  Presenting Complaints: 1. Acute onset of breathlessness over the past three hours  which has progressively worsened 2. Chest discomfort  felt mostly in the center and radiating towards the left arm 3. Syncopal episode in the morning  4. Cough with scanty phlegm and without hemoptysis (blood)  Recent Medication History:  1. Aspirin 81mg daily 2. Metoprolol 50mg twice a day 3. Lisinopril 20mg daily 4. Metformin 500mg twice a day 5. Atorvastatin 80mg at bedtime 6. Post-operative analgesics and antibiotics  Setting: This case study aims to expose medical students to the life-threatening condition of acute pulmonary embolism. We put emphasis on its risk factors (such as recent surgery and immobilization)  typical clinical presentation (dyspnea  chest pain  syncope)  and common findings on physical examination and diagnostic tests. The exercises should encourage students to apply their knowledge from didactic lectures  refine their clinical reasoning skills  and become proficient in managing acute pulmonary embolism.  Notes: This case report is designed to echo common presentations of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's demographic features (older age  male  Caucasian) and background (recent surgery  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history) align with known risk factors for PE  hence enhancing case relevancy and applicability for trainees. The choice of a male patient deliberately deviates from the slight female predilection for PE to counter gender bias in medical training and stress that PE affects both sexes. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,89,Patient Case  Demographics:   Patient is Mrs. Elizabeth Goodwill  a 65-year-old African American female retired high school teacher. She is widowed and lives alone but has close contact with her two daughters who live nearby.  Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension for the last 20 years controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10 mg daily). She was diagnosed with obesity (BMI 35) and type II diabetes mellitus five years ago. She fell and fractured her right hip 4 weeks ago and had surgical repair  after which she was confined to bed but has started ambulating since 1 week. She has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit about 20 years ago. No known allergies. No previous history of venous thromboembolism or known thrombophilic disorder. Her father had a history of deep vein thrombosis.  Key Complaints: She presented to hospital emergency complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath since 4 hours. The breathlessness is increasing  and now she feels breathless at rest. She also reports a sharp  localized (to middle of the chest)  pleuritic chest pain that exacerbates with deep breaths and coughing. She feels somewhat lightheaded and had an episode of fainting at home before coming to the hospital.  This patient case of a post-operative  bedridden female with multiple risk factors (obesity  age  history of smoking  and diabetes) demonstrates a typical scenario for an acute pulmonary embolism. The racial demographic of the patient is chosen based on literature which shows a relatively high prevalence of pulmonary embolism among African American population. Her gender has been chosen as female as women have been shown to have a slightly higher risk of pulmonary embolism  although it can affect both genders. The case is designed to help medical students to identify similar high-risk scenarios with appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,90,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 55-year-old African-American male.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe  a former smoker for 30 years  quit smoking five years ago. He has a known history of hypertension (maintained under control with ACE inhibitors) for ten years. He underwent a knee replacement surgery four weeks ago due to severe osteoarthritis. He is currently not adherent to his prescribed post-surgical physiotherapy due to reported discomfort  and leads an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.  Key Complaints: Mr. Doe presents to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset shortness of breath that started earlier in the day and has progressively worsened- he now struggles to walk short distances around his home. He also reports a sharp  stabbing chest pain that intensifies with deep breathing. Furthermore  there is a semi-recurrent dry cough without any apparent sputum or hemoptysis. He additionally reveals experiencing a transient bout of dizziness earlier in the day  but denies any syncopal episodes. It's noteworthy that he recently noticed swelling and a slight color change (esto-cyanosis) in his right lower extremity  yet didn't seek medical attention at that point. Lately  he has had no fever  cold  or any other systemic complaints. He denies any recent long-distance travel  family history of coagulation disorders  or repetitive trauma to his legs.  Reason for the presentation of the case: This case reflects classic presentation features of acute pulmonary embolism  specifically its occurrence in postoperative  sedentary patients. The shortness of breath  chest pain  and cough  paired with signs of deep-vein thrombosis (unilateral leg swelling  discoloration)  align with symptoms of PE. Training medical students on this case will enable them to recognize the high-risk profile  typical symptoms  and potentially lethal consequences  thereby underlining the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,91,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Patient's pseudonym: Mrs. Joan Williams  Demographics: 67-year-old African American female  Occupation: Retired schoolteacher   Education: Bachelor's degree in English  Location: Urban community in Atlanta  Georgia  Marital Status: Widowed  Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History (PMH): Hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  history of stroke two years prior with a good recovery  no regular exercise regimen  former smoker (stopped 10 years ago)  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago.  Family History: Father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 76. Mother died from stroke at the age of 82. Older brother living with type II diabetes and hypertension with a recent DVT. No family history of cancers  kidney diseases  or autoimmune diseases.   Chief Complaints: Sudden onset shortness of breath  sharp pain in lower chest  pain in the right leg  and light-headedness.  Scenario:  Mrs. Williams presented to the emergency department complaining of acute  sudden-onset shortness of breath  sharp pain in her lower chest that exacerbates with deep breaths  and a mild consistent pain in the right leg. She has been feeling light-headed and has experienced two mild episodes of syncope at home earlier in the day.   Her recent lab results show a slightly elevated glucose level and hypertension. She is on regular medications including insulin  anti-hypertensives and cholesterol-lowering drugs. She had been adhering to her medication schedule to manage her chronic conditions.   Mrs. Williams is a widowed African American woman living alone in a city environment  which may affect her psychosocial and physical well-being  contributing to her risk factors. She requires a deep diagnostic process given her past medical history of DVT and recently experienced symptoms that are highly suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism.  This case was created considering literature showing that African American females are at a higher risk for PE  particularly those with uncontrolled and untreated chronic medical health issues like hypertension and diabetes. Age is also a factor in the risk for PE  with those over the age of 60 at an elevated risk.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,92,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Luke Martinez  65-year-old Hispanic male  retired and living in suburban Texas. He is a former smoker  quitting 10 years ago  with consumptive habits of two packs a day for approximately 40 years. The patient is married and has 3 adult children. He speaks both English and Spanish  but English has been identified as his preferred language for medical consultation. He is a low-income patient  dependent on Medicare for his medical expenses.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez's history is fairly complex. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both currently controlled with prescribed medication. Despite quitting  his smoking history predisposes him to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and he reports limited physical endurance due to breathlessness. Additionally  he was diagnosed two years ago with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was treated with anticoagulants. He has a history of missed CE appointments due to transportation issues and the medication costs.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Martinez has visited the emergency department  expressing complaints of sudden 'pleuritic' chest pain  exacerbated by deep breathing and shortness of breath. Psychic distress caused by an unexpected feeling of unease and fear of dying is noted. Coughing up blood was not noted from the patient's account. His wife also mentions that for the past one day  he had been appearing unusually restless and fatigued.  Discussion Points: This case represents a classic scenario of a patient at high-risk of developing a Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  and calls the students to consider complex lifestyles and chronic conditions. Interpreting the symptoms  identifying risk factors  deciding on urgency  understanding the potential prevalence of PE among the Hispanic population and managing patient non-compliance and medical history in a culturally competent manner  are the focal points of this training case.  Note: This case was designed keeping in mind the imperative for demographic representation. As various studies indicate that Hispanics have a higher prevalence of risk factors for PE including obesity and diabetes  our case focuses on an older  male patient from a Hispanic background  with a history of DVT  and current COPD.                                                                 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,93,"Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Mr. M is a 68-year-old African American male  who is retired and lives with his wife. He is graduated and used to work as a truck driver. He is a non-smoker  did not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History: The patient has been known to have uncontrolled hypertension for more than 20 years and has a past medical history of obesity (BMI 34). He sustained a left femur fracture about 8 weeks ago and underwent an open reduction and internal fixation  but his physical activity has been significantly limited since then.  Key Complaints: He is presenting with sudden onset shortness of breath that began this afternoon  which he describes as an """"unable to get enough air"""" feeling. He also mentions experiencing sharp  substernal chest pain that gets worse with deep breaths. He reports feeling light-headed and is particularly concerned about an episode of fainting that happened while he was trying to walk to the bathroom. His wife noticed recent episodes of leg swelling which he ignored attributing it to his limited mobility post-surgery.  Background: Pulmonary Embolism is most common in African American males over the age of 60 with risk factors such as surgery  immobility  trauma  obesity  and hypertension. The prevalence is slightly higher among men than women.  Note: This case highlights the typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism but it's important to remember that PE often presents atypically  and a high degree of suspicion is necessary in patients with risk factors. It also emphasizes that patients do not always acknowledge or realize the significance of symptoms such as leg swelling. Regular patient education about possible postoperative complications can be a key preventative strategy.   Cultural Competency: While developing case-based discussions  educators should ensure to address cultural and demographic differences in patient management. Acknowledge and counteract biases may present in healthcare and incorporate a patient-centered approach considering socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds."
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,94,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Angela Brown Gender: Female Age: 62 years Race: Caucasian   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Brown is obese with a BMI of 31.5. She reports a lengthy history of hypertension  which is currently controlled with medication (hydrochlorothiazide). Further  she suffers from type II diabetes mellitus for which she takes metformin. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed about three years ago. She is a non-smoker and moderately active. Her family history registers a premature death of her mother from myocardial infarction at the age of 57.   Key Complaints: Mrs. Brown  an elementary school teacher  walked into the emergency department early in the morning complaining of a sudden onset of sharp  stabbing chest pain that started a few hours ago  exacerbated by deep breathing. She reported feeling short of breath and lightheadedness. She also complained of an intermittent dry cough. Upon observation  she appeared mildly anxious  was sweating  and her skin was slightly pale.   Such demographics are aptly representative as per various literature  where females  especially over 60 years of age with obesity  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and prior history of DVT are more vulnerable to acute pulmonary embolism. The symptoms including chest pain  shortness of breath  dry cough  and lightheadedness are some of the most common manifestations of acute pulmonary embolism. The racial demographic is also pertinent  as Caucasian ancestry confers a higher risk for the condition.   References: 1. Goldhaber SZ  Bounameaux H. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,95,Case Study:  Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 60 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Commercial truck driver Smoking status: Ex-smoker  quit ten years ago Alcohol status: Drinks socially; no alcohol abuse identified  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg after a fracture two years ago which was treated. He has been a type 2 diabetic for the last ten years  controlled with metformin  and has a history of hypertension that is being managed with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine since last year. He is obese with a BMI of 32 kg/m2 and has been advised a weight loss program. He had been asymptomatic since the DVT treatment  with no other significant health complaints.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe presents with sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain that started when resting at home and has progressively gotten worse over the last few hours. He also feels a general sense of unease and anxiety  with mild dizziness.  Initial Observation:  Mr. Doe is alert and oriented but appears anxious and slightly confused. His vital signs are as follows: heart rate: 110 beats/minute; blood pressure: 142/90 mmHg; respiratory rate: 22 breaths/minute; O2 sat: 90% on room air. On physical examination  he is found to be in respiratory distress with a slightly decreased breath sound on his right lower chest.  Based on the patient’s clinical presentation  history of DVT  and current symptoms  a working diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) is made.   This case was designed keeping in mind that pulmonary embolism most commonly affects adults over 60 (as per the demographic data represented in medical literature)  and it carries a higher risk in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism  obesity  chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension  and factors such as previous trauma or surgery which contribute to immobility.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,96,Patient Information: A 70-year-old African American female   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and is a former smoker. The patient also has a recent history of right total hip replacement surgery that was performed 10 days ago.   Key Complaints: The patient arrives at the emergency department looking visibly distressed. She complains of sudden onset chest pain that she describes as “sharp” and “stabbing”  which worsens when she tries to take a deep breath. She also reports feeling increasingly short of breath over the past few hours and lightheaded. She has a slight cough but denies hemoptysis. She also states that she noticed her heart was racing.   Rationale: This case represents several risk factors and clinical features associated with acute pulmonary embolism. These include advanced age  recent orthopedic surgery  use of tobacco  sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea. It should be noted that pulmonary embolism can be seen in a variety of ethnicities but a greater incidence among African Americans is reported over Caucasians hence the choice of the patient's demographics.   Learning Objective:  -Reinforce clinical knowledge regarding the signs  symptoms  and risk factors associated with acute pulmonary embolism. -Encourage appropriate deduction and critical thinking skills with respect to initial diagnostic workup and management options. -Incorporate patient demographic factors to provide a representation accurate to clinical scenarios.  -Highlight the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis for any patient presenting with chest pain and dyspnea  especially with a recent history of surgery or immobilization.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,97,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Rosa Ramirez Age: 63 Gender: Female Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic / Latino Occupation: Retired teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Case Report:  Mrs. Rosa Ramirez  a widow of Hispanic/Latino heritage presented herself to the Emergency Department. She is a retired teacher aged 63. She lives alone with her small dog but maintains close contact with her two adult children  who visit her weekly.  Medical history:  Mrs. Ramirez has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes over a decade ago  which is well-controlled through diet and metformin. She has a history of hypertension  managed with lisinopril. She was a sporadic smoker during her young adult years but quit 20 years ago. She has a BMI of 29  classifying her as overweight but has shown no other signs of heart disease. Recently  she was treated for a broken ankle  resulting from a minor fall and her immobilization lasted for six weeks.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Ramirez arrived at the hospital expressing escalating difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) over the previous several hours. Additionally  she noted an incident of fainting (syncope) in the morning which was an isolated incident. She also reported feeling lightheaded at times over the past two days. Mild chest pain and discomfort that wasn’t tied to exertion was mentioned as well. She stated that she had been largely sedentary since her ankle fracture but was normally active prior to it. Mrs. Ramirez also indicated that she had been experiencing occasional rapid heart rate (palpitations).  Key Points for Discussion:  This case of potential acute pulmonary embolism encourages medical students to explore the connections between immobilization  age  co-existing medical conditions  and the development of pulmonary embolism.  According to literature  acute pulmonary embolism is common among older adults  particularly those that have experienced recent immobilization (such as Mrs. Ramirez's broken ankle)  those with hypertension  overweight or obesity  and those with a history of smoking. Furthermore  individuals diagnosed with diabetes are at a higher risk for developing blood clots  therefore  increasing their vulnerability for pulmonary embolism. Additionally  there is a higher prevalence of pulmonary embolism in the Hispanic population.  Review the signs of acute pulmonary embolism (dyspnea  chest pain  syncopal episode) in this demographic and discuss potential diagnostic tests (D-dimer  CTA  V/Q scan) and treatments (anticoagulants  thrombolytics).
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,98,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Demographic Information: Patient X is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman with an active lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Patient history includes controlled hypertension for 15 years and a recent (6 weeks prior) total knee replacement surgery on the left side. She is a former smoker  quitting about 20 years ago. She has no history of any respiratory diseases such as COPD or Asthma. No family history of thromboembolic diseases or any genetic coagulopathies has been reported.  Presenting Complaints: Patient X presents with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain started two hours prior to her arrival at the emergency department. The pain is sharp  localized on the right side and increases on deep breathing. She rates it as 7/10 on the pain scale. She also reports an associated feeling of breathlessness with minimal exertion and dizziness but denies cough  hemoptysis  fever  or lower limb swelling. She denies recent travels or prolonged immobilization.  Additional Note: The age  gender and post-surgical status of this patient align with the demographic risk factors  as pulmonary embolism is more frequent in elderly patients  postsurgical patients and slightly higher incidence in females.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,99,Case Report: Acute Pulley Embolism  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 70-year-old  white male  retired truck driver  who lives alone in a suburban environment. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but has a history of 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking. He has a moderate alcohol consumption history  consuming approximately two 12 oz beers every evening.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  for which he is currently taking a bronchodilator (tiotropium bromide). He also suffered a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago and completed a course of anticoagulation at that time. In addition  he has well-controlled hypertension  managed by hydrochlorothiazide and losartan  and type II diabetes controlled with metformin. The patient had a physical examination six months ago  and no significant abnormalities were reported. His BMI is 32  indicating obesity.  Key Complaints:  The patient has come to the ER complaining of sudden-onset shortness of breath  chest pain and a sense of unease  and mentions that symptoms started while he was climbing stairs at home. He rates the pain as 7/10  which he describes as sharp and located on the right side of his chest  worsening on deep inspiration. He also mentions a recent trip via airplane where he was immobilized in a seated position for several hours. He denies any cough  fever  haemoptysis  recent surgery  trauma or leg swelling.  Given the patient's presentation and medical history  a high clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) should be considered. The scenario also introduces the concept of Virchow's triad (hypercoagulability  vascular damage  and stasis of blood flow)  which underlies the pathogenesis of thrombus formation leading to a potential PE diagnosis. This case encourages the exploration of risk factors (old age  prolonged immobilization  previous DVT  COPD)  symptoms  diagnostic methods  and treatment options for acute pulmonary embolism.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism,10,100,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. E.F. is a 67-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago  for which he was treated. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to a long-term smoking habit.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. E.F. has unexpectedly presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that increases with deep breaths. He also mentioned experiencing lightheadedness and a coughing episode with rusty sputum in the morning.  Note: As per literature  pulmonary embolism tends to be more prevalent among elderly patients and those with a history of previous vein thrombosis or lung disease. While it can occur in all ethnic groups and genders  a higher risk has been identified in Caucasian compared to other racial and ethnic groups.  The case features some of the common symptoms associated with acute pulmonary embolisms. Should Mr. E.F's chest pain fail to subside with rest or nitroglycerin  further investigation into the possibility of pulmonary embolism becomes a priority  especially given his past medical history of DVT and COPD. As the case progresses  students should learn to appropriately assess such patients  identify risk factors  and manage acute pulmonary embolisms as a matter of emergency.
