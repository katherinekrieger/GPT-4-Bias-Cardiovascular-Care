Coronary artery disease,1,1,"Presentation of the Patient  Today  I present Mr. Richard Thompson  a 64-year-old Caucasian male recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He is a married retiree and a lifelong resident of Manhattan  Kansas. Prior to retirement  Mr. Thompson worked in construction for over 25 years.   Medical History  Mr. Thomson weighs 220 lbs and stands 5' 10"""" tall  indicative of obesity given his BMI. He is an active smoker with a smoking history of 40 pack-years and consumes moderate alcohol. He also has a moderately sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are common comorbidities in patients with CAD. He has been under treatment with Metoprolol for BP control and Metformin for blood glucose control. He reports adherence to his medical regimen and regular follow-up with his primary care physician.   Family History  In terms of family history  Mr. Thompson's father had suffered from a myocardial infarction at 72  and his eldest brother  at 62  was diagnosed with coronary artery disease suggesting a possible genetic predisposition.  Presentation and Early Diagnosis  Mr. Thompson first presented with chest pain that he initially attributed to acid reflux or occasional heartburn. However  the persisting symptoms of exertional chest pain  dyspnea  fatigue  and dizziness over a few weeks led him to seek medical attention. An early diagnosis was suggested through abnormal findings in his electrocardiogram and was later confirmed by an exercise stress test and coronary angiography.  Risk Factors  It is imperative to note the several risk factors augmenting Mr. Thompson's condition. His prolonged tobacco use  poor diet high in processed and fatty foods  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and uncontrolled hypertension  along with his family history of heart disease  are all contributing to his CAD.  Conclusion  In conclusion  Mr. Thompson  like many other individuals with coronary artery disease  exhibits modifiable risk factors  including smoking  obesity  physical inactivity  and an unhealthy diet  indicating that lifestyle modification should be an integral part of his treatment plan  along with medical management.  In the future  it will be crucial for Mr. Thompson to work closely with his healthcare team—consisting of a cardiologist  a dietician  a diabetic educator  and a physical therapist  along with his primary care provider—to ensure optimal care and implement lifestyle changes to manage his coronary artery disease effectively.  Demographic information and aspects of the case were taken and modified from statistics gathered by the American Heart Association 2021 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update."

Coronary artery disease,1,3,Title: Presentation of a Case with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction: Today  I will brief you about a 66-year-old Caucasian male presenting with signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a retired schoolteacher who lives in a suburban community. He presented to our clinic complaining of intermittent and worsening chest pain  particularly during physical activity  which he refers to as angina.   Demographic Details: As per literature  CAD is most common in Caucasians in their middle to late ages  aligns with our patient who is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He lives in a stable  loving family environment with his wife  two grown-up children  and four grandkids. He is an active member of his community.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. Both of these are identified risk factors for CAD. There is also a positive family history of cardiovascular disease  as his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Social History: Mr. Johnson used to smoke in his early years but quit approximately 15 years ago. He enjoys a moderate intake of alcohol. He admits his diet is not always the healthiest and lacks regular exercise  which certainly contributes to his condition.   Symptomatology: Mr. Johnson describes his symptoms as chest discomfort located in the central and left chest area  radiating down his left arm and up to his jaw. The pain often occurs during activities like gardening or carrying heavy grocery bags and occasionally wakes him up from sleep. He also reports symptoms of fatigue  shortness of breath  and occasional dizziness.  Conclusion: Various risk factors contribute to the development of CAD in Mr. Johnson. These include his age  sex  Caucasian ethnicity  history of hypertension and diabetes  family history of cardiovascular disease  previous smoking habit  current diet  and physical inactivity. Therefore  it is essential to take a comprehensive approach for the treatment. It would include lifestyle changes  appropriate medications  routine follow-ups  and possibly cardiac rehabilitation.

Coronary artery disease,1,4,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Information: Mr. Adams  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic with increasing episodes of chest pain over the past few weeks  especially during physical exertion. He is an active smoker and has been smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for over 30 years. He is retired and lives alone.   Family History: There is a strong history of heart disease in his family with his late father having suffered a heart attack at the age of 50. His mother died of stroke and his elder brother was recently diagnosed with CAD.  Medical History: Mr. Adams has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but has been inconsistently following his medication regimen. His lipid profile shows elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol levels. He is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.4 kg/m^2. His past medical history also includes type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he has been advised lifestyle modifications along with antihyperglycemic therapy  but his compliance with these recommendations is questionable. Blood glucose is poorly controlled with a HbA1c value of 8.2%.   Clinical Examination: He presents with shortness of breath and a resting blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. On cardiac examination  there are no apparent abnormal heart sounds. However  an electrocardiogram (ECG) shows suggestive signs of silent myocardial ischemia.  Working Diagnosis: The patient's history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and family history of heart disease  in combination with his chest pains and ECG findings  points to a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Next Steps: Considering the patient’s symptoms and risk profile  a more definitive diagnostic tool such as an angiogram may be considered to confirm CAD and outline the course of treatment. This case emphasizes the importance of risk factor management and patient education in CAD  underlining the need for better compliance with prescribed medication and lifestyle modification.

Coronary artery disease,1,5,Title: Presentation of a Coronary Artery Disease Patient  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe is a 67-year-old Caucasian male. He lives in Toronto  Canada  and works as a financial advisor. He is married  with three adult children. His BMI is 28.   Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been relatively healthy his entire life until 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which he is under medication.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe was admitted to the hospital with chest pain which he described as 'crushing' and radiating to his left arm. He felt nauseous and experienced shortness of breath for the past two days. The symptoms were more evident during physical exertion.  Past Medical History: His paternal grandfather suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 70  and his father had triple bypass surgery in his late sixties.   Smoking/Alcohol History: Mr. Doe quit smoking ten years ago but had a 20 pack-year smoking history prior to that. He drinks alcohol only occasionally.  Relevant Medications: He is on Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril & Atenolol for hypertension.  Unremarkable surgical history – aside from a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) done 3 years ago.  These characteristics of Mr. Doe are consistent with the typical demographic and clinical profile of many Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients. The prevalence of CAD increases with age and is more common among men than women according to literature. Also  his diabetes  hypertension  former smoking habits  and family history of heart disease risk factors all contribute to a higher chance of Coronary Artery Disease.  Early identification and treatment of risk factors  in this case  are crucial to manage the condition and prevent further coronary events. A multidisciplinary approach  incorporating lifestyle modifications  medication  and possibly surgical intervention will be the next steps in Mr. Doe's care plan.
Coronary artery disease,1,6,Title: Coronary Artery Disease Case Presentation   Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented to our clinic with recurrent bouts of chest pain (angina)  exacerbated upon exertion and relieved by rest. He also reported episodic shortness of breath and occasional lightheadedness over the past several months.   Demographic Information: Mr. Smith is a retired bank manager who lives in a suburban setting with his wife. He's an ex-smoker with a 30-pack year history and quit smoking approximately 10 years ago. He reports modest alcohol consumption  consisting of 1-2 drinks per week. Mr. Smith follows a relatively sedentary lifestyle and his diet is high in saturated fats and cholesterol.  Past Medical History: There is a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) established 7 years ago  which is managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He was diagnosed with Hypertension (HTN) about 15 years ago and is currently on antihypertensive medications. His last recorded blood pressure was 150/90mmHg. There is a history of obesity with his current Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as 32 kg/m2. He underwent a gall bladder removal (cholecystectomy) for gall stones 5 years ago and is otherwise healthy.  Mr. Smith has a familial history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 years.   Summary: This case carries significant demographic features associated with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) per literature survey. This includes the age  sex (male)  and race (Caucasian) of the patient. The presence of multiple risk factors such as DM  HTN  obesity  familial history of CAD  high cholesterol diet  sedentary lifestyle  and a significant smoking history suggest a high risk for development and progression of CAD. A thorough evaluation is essential followed by aggressive management to reduce the burden of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,1,7,Title: Presentation of a Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Patient  Introduction: We present today the case of Mr. Jones  a Hispanic male patient aged 65 years  from an urban area of Southern California who attended our clinic with typical features of coronary artery disease.   Demographic Information:  Patient’s Name: Mr. Jones Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired School teacher Living situation: Lives with spouse in an urban residential neighborhood   Medical History: Mr. Jones is a non-smoker but has a documented medical history of Type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia  all of which are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. He has been battling with these conditions for the past 15 years and is compliant with treatment protocols. Mr. Jones has a paternal history of CAD with his father passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His alcohol intake is within moderate limits.   Recent Illness History: Approximately two months ago  Mr. Jones complained of chest pain radiating to the neck  left shoulder  and arms after carrying groceries from his car. At first  he dismissed the pain as fatigue or pulled muscle. However  the chest pain episodes increased in number and intensity over the past seven weeks  especially after physical exertion or heavy meals. The pain is described as a 'pressure-like' feeling in the chest  typically relieved after a few minutes of rest. He also reported shortness of breath after walking up stairs or inclines.   Physical Examination: Mr. Jones' physical examination was notable for an elevated Blood Pressure (150/95 mm Hg) while his BMI was found to be 29 kg/m² suggesting he is overweight. Normal heart sounds were heard with no murmurs or added sounds.   To sum it up  considering his age group  ethnicity  existing comorbidities of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  positive family history  and presenting symptoms  Mr. Jones displays typical features attributable to coronary artery disease. He will now undergo further evaluation including workup of cardiac enzymes  EKG  and necessary imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and to plan further management strategies. It's important to note that CAD is common in older adults  especially males  and those with type 2 diabetes and hypertension  like Mr. Jones. It is also the leading cause of death in Hispanic men above 60 years of age. 
Coronary artery disease,1,8,Presentation of Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  I would like to present the case of Mr. James Allen  a 65-year-old African-American male from Texas  USA. According to data from the CDC  coronary artery disease is prevalent in 6.7% of American males aged over 60 with African American men having the highest prevalence of CAD among all ethnic groups in America.  Mr. Allen is a retired US Army veteran and has a long history of smoking - he smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years  though he was able to quit 5 years ago. The literature confirms that smoking is a substantial risk factor for developing CAD. Prior to his retirement  Mr. Allen held a high-stress job in the military  further contributing to the risk.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  diagnosed at age 52  and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed at age 60. Both are well-documented risk factors for CAD. His 3 years follow-up post-diagnosis revealed uncontrolled hypertension and glycemic levels despite medication indicating poor management of his conditions.  His family history is positive for cardiovascular diseases  his father died at age 62 with myocardial infarction and his mother had a stroke at age 70. Given the prominent family history of cardiovascular diseases  there is an increased risk of Mr. Allen developing CAD.  Mr. Allen's diet is high in fats and he has been physically inactive since his retirement. This lifestyle has led to obesity  with a current BMI of 32. Various studies show that these modifiable lifestyle factors contribute significantly to the development of CAD.  In conclusion  Mr. Allen is a case with multiple risk factors for CAD including advanced age  race  uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  history of tobacco use  family history of cardiovascular diseases  a high-stress job  poor diet  physical inactivity  and obesity. His profile reflects the complex interaction of genetic  environmental  and lifestyle factors that lead to CAD. Further investigations would be required to confirm the diagnosis and appropriate lifestyle modifications and medications should be considered for management.

Coronary artery disease,1,10,"Patient Presentation:  """"Good morning everyone  today we are discussing the case of Mr. Johnson  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  who is presenting with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD). Mr. Johnson resides in a suburban neighborhood in New Jersey and lives with his wife of 40 years. He is a retired laborer with a history of smoking  which he gave up 10 years ago.   From his social history  we learn that Mr. Johnson has led a sedentary lifestyle with an unbalanced diet high in saturated fats. His BMI is 27  putting him in the overweight category. He consumes alcohol occasionally  typically limited to one glass of wine during dinners and the holidays.   Mr. Johnson has a pertinent family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at 65 and a mother who has been dealing with chronic hypertension.   In terms of past medical history  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years ago and hypertension 10 years ago  both of which are currently managed with medications - Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension.   Recently  Mr. Johnson reported experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath  particularly when engaging in physical activities like gardening or climbing stairs. The chest pain is described as heavy and pressing  often radiating to the left arm. This has prompted his visit to our practice today  suspecting CAD.   Upon examination  his blood pressure was recorded as 140/90 mmHg and a resting heart rate of 90 bpm. The rest of his examination findings were largely unremarkable. We plan to arrange further investigations including blood tests  ECG  and a possible angiogram to confirm our suspicions and establish the extent of the possible coronary artery disease.""""  In presenting Mr. Johnson's case  we recognize that he is among the majority demographic suffering from CAD  given that coronary artery disease often affects males over the age of 45 and those with risk factors such as smoking history  high blood pressure  high cholesterol  diabetes  obesity  physical inactivity  unhealthy diet  and a family history of CAD. These accurate demographic and medical factors put Mr. Johnson at a higher risk of developing CAD."

Coronary artery disease,1,12,Title: Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  named Robert 75 Kg in weight  and 172 cm in height  who currently resides in Seattle  Washington. The patient is retired  a former long-haul truck driver  and his socio-economic stratum is lower-middle class. The role of ethnicity  age  occupation  socio-economic factors  and region are significant in affecting the prevalence of CAD  etiologically tied to lifestyle and access to healthcare.   Past Medical History: Robert was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol about 15 years ago for which he was prescribed medication. Both conditions have been generally controlled with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. He is also a former smoker  with a 30 pack-year history but has been tobacco-free for the past five years. Robert has a family history of coronary artery diseases where his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 59. He reports moderate consumption of alcohol and admits to a sedentary lifestyle with a diet high in saturated fats and processed foods.  CAD Presentation: Robert presented with symptoms including exertional chest pain  described as a heavy pressure sensation radiating to his left arm  shortness of breath  and episodes of extreme fatigue and dizziness that had been progressively worsening over the past three months. Prior to these symptoms  Robert experienced occasional exertional chest discomfort that resolved with rest  attributing it to age-related weariness.  Upon examination  Robert appeared anxious and in mild distress with a vital sign: blood pressure of 153/90  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. His BMI calculated to be 25  which falls under overweight.    This case presentation provides an overview of typical CAD patients. According to literature  CAD is most common amongst older adults  usually 65 years and older  and it is more prevalent in males. The risk factors associated with CAD  such as hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking  and family history  are all present in Robert's case  making his case a classic example of a patient at high risk of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,1,13,Title: Case Presentation for Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Introduction: The patient is a 60 years old Caucasian male. He is a retiree  former construction manager  married with three adult children and lives with his spouse in suburban area.  Demographics: According to the American Heart Association  Caucasian males are a high-risk demographic for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The risk of developing CAD further increases after the age of 55  making our patient fall squarely within the high-risk demographics. Epidemiological studies have suggested an urban-suburban gradient in the prevalence of CAD  placing this patient at an intermediate risk level due to his suburban place of residence. Socioeconomic status also plays a role in CAD  with lower rates observed in high socioeconomic classes. His former managerial position allows us to classify him in the medium-high socioeconomic class.  Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history of hyperlipidemia and Type-II diabetes mellitus  which are well-established risk factors for CAD. His fasting blood glucose levels range around 160-200mg/dl and his latest lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol at 210mg/dL and LDL cholesterol at 160mg/mL. The patient has been taking medications for these conditions  but adherence may be sporadic. He has a sedentary lifestyle and history of smoking  which he quit about two years ago. There is no known family history of premature CAD. He is also known to suffer from occasional episodes of high stress.   Conclusion: Considering the age  gender  history of diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and behavioral risk factors like past history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and high stress; our patient presents a textbook case of high risk for CAD. A comprehensive cardiovascular risk management plan is crucial for such individuals  focusing on behavior modification accompanied by optimal medication therapy to ward off potential coronary artery events. It should be noted that the patient’s smoker status and sporadic medication adherence further necessitate a robust and all-encompassing CAD prevention strategy.

Coronary artery disease,1,14,Patient Presentation:   The purpose of this presentation is to discuss a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD).  Demographic Information:   The patient is a retired teacher  residing in Ohio. He is widowed and has two adult children who live in different states. He is relatively socially active  leading a quiet  comfortable life with regular visits to his children and grandchildren. His socioeconomic status can be categorized as middle class.  Past Medical History:   According to the patient's records  he was diagnosed with hypertension approximately ten years ago and has been on medication since then. He also has Type 2 diabetes  controlled through medication and diet. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol and since then  he has been compliant with his lipid-lowering therapy. The patient has a 30-year history of smoking  however  he managed to quit approximately seven years ago. Unfortunately  he still suffers from obesity  with a body mass index of 30. He does not have any known food or drug allergies.  Presenting Symptoms:   The patient has been experiencing episodes of chest discomfort and shortness of breath during his daily walks for the past two months. These episodes have been lasting for more than ten minutes and the typical trend has been for symptoms to diminish upon rest. He has sometimes experienced these symptoms while at rest as well.  Reason for CAD:  The most significant risk factors for this patient are the patient’s age  his long-term history of smoking  obesity  hypertension  and diabetes. Each of these is a well-known risk factor for the development of CAD.  In summary  the patient's demographics and past medical history accurately represent the typical profile of a CAD patient as described in numerous research studies. CAD is common in older age groups  being most prevalent amongst Caucasian males over 45. Modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol levels  obesity  diabetes  physical inactivity  and poor diet also contribute to CAD. These risk factors are well-documented in this patient’s medical history and lifestyle habits.
Coronary artery disease,1,15,"Title: Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Demographics: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male  presented with symptoms consistent with coronary artery disease. He is a retired steelworker who has lived in Brooklyn  New York for 30 years. He has been married for 40 years and has 2 grown children.   Prevalence:  According to literature  coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent type of heart disease in the United States with an estimated incidence of nearly one in 13 men aged 60 to 79 years old. African American men  in particular  have higher prevalence rates of CAD compared to non-Hispanic whites.   Clinical History:   Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed for approximately 15 years with medication. He has a smoking history of 25 pack-years but quit 10 years ago. His father died of heart disease at age 60.   Presenting Symptoms:  He reported chronic symptoms of chest pain  particularly during physical activity  which tends to subside with rest. Lately  he also noticed experiencing shortness of breath and unusual fatigue. He states  """"I'm not able to do as much as I used to without getting tired.""""   On examination  he had a blood pressure of 140/90  heart rate of 80 beats per minute with a slight irregular rhythm  and a BMI of 30  which places him in the obese category. His chest was clear to auscultation  and his heart sounds were normal with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  In Conclusion:  Mr. John Doe's age  sex  ethnicity  medical history of hypertension and diabetes  and past smoking habit are all poignant risk factors for CAD  as per available literature. His presenting symptoms and family history of heart disease further substantiate the concern for CAD. He requires further diagnostic testing to confirm the disease and comprehensive health management moving forward. He may also benefit from lifestyle education  including dietary adjustments and physical activity  to limit disease progression and improve his quality of life."
Coronary artery disease,1,16,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in a Middle-Aged Male Patient  Introduction:  Today we will be discussing the case presentation involving a 54-year-old male patient  Mr. X  who is a longtime resident of New York City  USA. Mr. X identifies as Caucasian with no specific cultural or religious affiliations which might influence his healthcare management. He's unemployed  previously working as a truck driver  with a low socioeconomic status. He is divorced and lives alone. It's important to note here that these characteristics fit with the literature-proven majority  as heart disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD) is more prevalent in men  particularly Caucasian  and in those with lower socioeconomic background.  Description of the Present Complaint: Mr. X presented to the emergency room with severe central chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw  beginning 2 hours prior to arrival. It was associated with shortness of breath  sweating  and nausea. The pain was continuous and not relieved by nitroglycerin tablets that he had at home.  Medical History:  Mr. X has been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension and type II diabetes for the past ten years. He has also been a heavy smoker for almost 30 years and consumes alcohol regularly. His last check-up was six months ago by a local health clinic  but lack of compliance to medical therapy was evident.  Physical Examination: Mr. X appeared anxious and sweaty with a blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate 105/min  respiratory rate 22/min  and body mass index indicating obesity (34 Kg/m²). The cardiovascular exam showed decreased breath sounds at the lung bases and irregular heartbeats.  Investigations: An ECG showed evidence of ischemic changes suggestive of myocardial infarction and his blood test results indicated highly elevated troponin levels. Both these investigations pointed towards an acute coronary syndrome.  Discussion: Taken together  Mr. X's presenting symptoms  history  and findings are consistent with myocardial infarction  a serious manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is a chief contributor to morbidity and mortality among individuals such as Mr. X  who have a combination of risk factors including age  male gender  uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  substance abuse  and low socioeconomic status which often leads to poor access to healthcare and lifestyle modifications.  This case underscores the importance of aggressive management and risk factor modification in such patients to prevent disease progression and complications. Patient education  close monitoring  and reinforcement of adherence to medication and lifestyle changes are integral parts of managing such cases.
Coronary artery disease,1,17,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presentation: Mr. Smith  a retired Caucasian male of 65 years of age  presents himself today with complaints of ongoing chest discomfort  episodes of shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional dizziness over the last few months. The most distressing symptom that incited his visit is the chest discomfort  primarily elicited during moments of physical activity or emotional stress but alleviated during periods of rest.  Demographic Analysis: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a common health condition  more frequently seen in males especially in their middle age and tends to affect Caucasian individuals more in many communities. Mr. Smith's age  sex  and race thus place him squarely within the high-risk demographic group for CAD.  Past History: Mr. Smith has been a smoker for around 40 years but quit a year ago. He has a known history of hypertension for 10 years  for which he has been on medication (Beta-blocker) but with inconsistent compliance. He also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 7 years back  currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally  he had a BMI of 32 (classified as Obesity) on his last visit about 6 months ago.   Family history reveals that Mr. Smith's father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 59. There’s no history of any other familial genetic disorder.  Lifestyle factors: Mr. Smith is a former heavy smoker  with a sedentary lifestyle and a diet frequently high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables. Since retirement  he’s found it increasingly difficult to motivate himself to be physically active and has admitted to weight gain.  In summary: Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of long-term smoking  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and obesity. His advancing age  gender  race  and personal medical history together with his lifestyle choices significantly increase his risk for the progression of Coronary Artery Disease. 
Coronary artery disease,1,18,Title: Patient Presentation - Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction:  Today  I introduce a 65-year-old African American male  Mr. Henry Davis  currently residing in Chicago  Illinois. He presents with classic symptoms of coronary artery disease  which is primarily characterized by chest pain or angina.   Demographic Information:  Data reflects that coronary artery disease (CAD) is most prevalent in African American males aged over 45. Mr Davis leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle  which coupled with an unbalanced diet high in saturated fats  contributes to his risk factors. He is married  living with his wife  and has two adult children. He is a retired school teacher  and he currently has medical insurance through Medicare.   Symptoms:  He has come today for worsening chest pain that he describes as sharp and sometimes burning  radiating to his left arm and jaw. In addition  he has been experiencing shortness of breath  especially with exertion  occasional dizziness  and easy fatigability over the past few months.  Past Medical History:  Mr Davis has a history of managed Type-II Diabetes and Hypertension  diagnosed around 8 years ago. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for about 20 years  but quit 10 years ago. There has been no significant alcohol consumption. His father had died from CAD at the age of 62  which points towards a genetic predisposition. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose Aspirin. He has an allergy to Penicillin.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination reveals a BP of 140/90mm Hg  heart rate- 90 bpm  respiratory rate-18/min  and BMI at 30  placing him in the category of obesity. His cardiovascular examination exhibited diminished heart sounds and an irregular rhythm.  In conclusion  Mr. Davis's demographic background  personal habits  and hereditary factors predispose him unusually strongly to CAD. Given his symptoms  a routine of regular exercise  a balanced diet  adherence to prescribed medication  along with any other physician-recommended interventions are key to managing and possibly reversing his condition. 
Coronary artery disease,1,19,Title: Presentation of a patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular conditions witnessed globally  with a higher propensity in males over 50 years of age and postmenopausal women.   Patient Demographics: Presenting is Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old white male of non-Hispanic origin. Mr. Doe is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  and drinks alcohol moderately. He is a retired Army officer and currently lives with his wife in an urban setting in New York. He is of average socio-economic status and has healthcare coverage. He is currently sedentary  and has a family history of CAD.  Health History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  for which he is on medication. He has also been controlling his cholesterol levels with medication for 7 years. He has a history of being overweight  but has had regular control of his weight for the past 5 years through diet and occasional exercise.  Presenting Condition: He presented symptoms of chronic stable angina pectoris with occasional shortness of breath. He describes the pain as a tightness in the chest  primarily after physical activity  which resolves with rest. Recent episodes have increased in frequency and intensity.   The electrocardiogram (EKG) performed showed patterns indicating possible ischemia. Given his past medical history  behavioral factors like his sedentary lifestyle  age and family history  he is at a significant risk for coronary artery disease.   Conclusion: In conclusion  Mr. Doe's presentation and health background indicate that he may be experiencing the onset of Coronary Artery Disease. He fits within the demographic often associated with CAD - males over 50 years old. His history with hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia add to the risk. The report strongly recommends further diagnostic investigations like an exercise stress test or a coronary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis of CAD.   No intervention recommendation can be made without further diagnostic certainty. However  it is advised that Mr. Doe is counseled regarding lifestyle modifications such as a regular exercise routine  a healthier diet  and adhering to prescriptions for his existing health conditions.
Coronary artery disease,1,20,Title: Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith is a 62-year-old African American male  retired as a bank manager  who resides in Houston  Texas. He is married and lives with his wife and has two adult children. He is a former smoker with a 25-pack year history  and quit 5 years ago. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and type 2 diabetes 5 years ago. Both his conditions are partially controlled under medications. Over the years  he has maintained a consistent slightly overweight to obese BMI with occasional fluctuations.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with complaints of recurrent chest pain over the last three weeks. The pain is severe and crushing in nature  mostly centered in the chest  radiating to the left jaw and arm. It tends to precipitate on exertion and relieves partially on rest.   Medical History : John has been on medication for hypertension (Lisinopril) and Type 2 diabetes (Metformin). He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia three years ago and is on Atorvastatin. He also experiences occasional episodes of angina for which he has been prescribed Nitroglycerin as needed. He has a documented history of non-compliance to diet and prescribed medication.  Family History: His mother died from a stroke at the age of 68  and his father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 72. His elder brother  currently 65  underwent angioplasty two years ago.  Reducing Risk Factors : Given his current condition  it is recommended for the patient to maintain a healthy BMI  mediterranean diet  follow a moderate-intensity physical activity regimen  and engage in cardiac rehabilitation. He is also urged to adhere to his prescribed medication to better manage his health conditions and slow down the progression of his disease.  Management : Due to recurrent episodes of angina and his high-risk profile  Mr. Smith might benefit from further diagnostic tests  including ECG or possibly a coronary angiogram. He may require a revision in his medication regimen with the possible addition of drugs like Beta-Blockers and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Given his family history and past medical history  revascularization procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery may also be considered in the future.  In conclusion  Mr. Smith's diagnosis of coronary artery disease is likely due to the interplay of non-modifiable risk factors like genetic predisposition and age  and modifiable factors such as smoking  poorly controlled hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Management will involve both lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy depending upon his risk stratification.
Coronary artery disease,1,21,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient's Name: Mr. Robert Henderson Age: 62 Years Old Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Construction Engineer Residential Area: Chicago  Illinois  Brief Patient History: Mr. Henderson presents with a documented medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In the past  his levels of cholesterol have been widely fluctuating  despite being under medication. He has also been a smoker for the past 40 years with numerous failed attempts to quit. Additionally  he reports a family history of heart disease  specifically his father suffered from a fatal myocardial infarction at a similar age.  Recent Symptoms: Over the past few months  Mr. Henderson has been experiencing episodes of chest discomfort and pain. The discomfort is mainly located in the center of the chest and often radiates to the left arm or neck. Mr. Henderson reports that these episodes usually last for about 5 minutes and are commonly triggered by exertion or stress  however  are quickly alleviated with rest. Recently  he has noticed these symptoms can occasionally appear during rest as well. Accompanying these episodes  he also experiences shortness of breath  night sweats  and fatigue.  Physical Examination and Test Results: Upon examination  Mr. Henderson has a noticeable increase in heart rate and blood pressure  consistent with his previous medical history. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed occasional ST-segment depression during chest pain episodes. The results of the stress test were positive  with episodes of angina being triggered under controlled conditions. His lipid profile showed elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.  Final Statement: Considering Mr. Henderson's medical and family history  his ethnicity  and the fact he is a long-term smoker  he is at high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). His symptomatology and test findings further solidify the CAD diagnosis. Mr. Henderson should have a consultation with a cardiologist to undergo angiography to confirm the extent of coronary blockage and discuss potential therapeutic strategies including lifestyle changes  pharmacological intervention  stenting or bypass surgery as necessary. His case is representative of epidemiological trends indicating African American males  over the age of 60  smokers with a family history of heart disease are at heightened risk for coronary artery disease.

He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation which gets worse with physical activity and stress and reported some episodes of shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a medical history significant for hypertension  diagnosed 5 years ago  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 7 years ago. Both conditions are being managed with oral medications including Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. His diabetes has been fairly controlled with recent HbA1c levels at around 7.1%.  Family History: There is a known history of coronary artery disease in his family. His father had a myocardial infarction at 65 years and his elder brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 59.  Lifestyle: Mr. Johnson is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. His diet consists largely of processed foods with high salt content. He is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 and his physical activities are minimal since his retirement.  Preliminary Assessment: Given Mr. Johnson's age  gender  ethnicity  family history  existing co-morbidities  unhealthy diet  and sedentary lifestyle  he is at a higher risk for coronary artery disease. His symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath further suggest the same.  Planning: Mr. Johnson has been scheduled for further diagnostic tests including electrocardiogram  lipid profile  and a potential angiogram based on the results. It has also been recommended that he start a low-sodium diet  increase physical activities  and consult with a diabetes educator for better glycemic control.  In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's case is a typical presentation of coronary artery disease with a strong contribution from several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. His management plan will likely require medical interventions  as well as lifestyle modifications.   The demographics of this case have been selected to highlight the higher prevalence rates of coronary artery disease in older males - particularly of African American ethnicity - who have a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular disease.

Coronary artery disease,1,25,Title: Case Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease  Patient profile:  Mr. J.D is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired  married  and lives in a suburban setting in Indiana. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but had a history of 30 pack-years. He drinks alcohol socially  usually one drink per week  and has a diet high in saturated fats.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. J.D presented with a four-week history of intermittent chest tightness that radiates down his left arm. The chest discomfort is associated with mild shortness of breath and palpitations  usually triggered by physical activity or emotional stress  and lasts for roughly 10 minutes  ceasing with rest. In the last week  the symptoms have increased in severity to include episodes of dizziness.   Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension for the past 20 years  controlled with Lisinopril. His cholesterol level has been increased - LDL 170 mg/dL measured last year and he is on Atorvastatin for the same. He also has type 2 diabetes which is controlled with Metformin. He had a cerebrovascular accident 5 years ago with no residual deficits.   Family History: His father passed away at the age of 74 due to a myocardial infarction  and his elder brother  72 years old  has undergone angioplasty for coronary artery disease.   Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  he was found to have a BMI of 29 kg/m2  Blood pressure is 135/88 mmHg  pulse rate is 78 bpm regular  respiratory rate is normal. Cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormalities - normal heart sounds  no murmurs  and lungs were clear bilaterally. There were no peripheral signs of chronic vascular deficiency.   Based on the characteristics of the chest pain  associating symptoms  risk factors  and physical examination  Mr J.D likely has stable angina due to coronary artery disease. This patient will require an urgent referral for further investigative procedures involving cardiac imaging and  if necessary  invasive strategies to establish the diagnosis.    This concludes the presentation. From here we can discuss the potential management plan and prognostic considerations for Mr. J.D.
Coronary artery disease,1,26,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Information: The patient is Mr. John Williams  a 63-year-old African American male currently residing in an urban environment in Chicago  Illinois. He is a retired taxi driver  presently living with his wife. Mr. Williams is a nonsmoker but has a history of heavy alcohol use however he has been sober for the last 3 years.  Medical History: Mr. Williams has a significant medical history. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ten years ago  which he manages with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has also been managing hypertension for the past eight years using anti-hypertensive medication. There is a familial predisposition  as his father and older brother both had heart diseases.   Current Presentation:  Over the past couple of months  Mr. Williams has been experiencing progressive chest pain  particularly with exertion. The pain is often central  crushing  and sometimes radiates to his left arm. He experiences relief from pain when he is at rest. Apart from this  he has been noticing a shortness of breath  fatigue  and unexplained episodes of sweatiness.   These concerning symptoms have prompted his visit to the clinic. Preliminary analysis indicates angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. As his symptoms are gradually worsening and because of his medical history  there is a high risk of acute complications  such as a myocardial infarction.   Mr. Williams' demographic of being a 63-year-old African American male  alongside his medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and familial predisposition to heart diseases  align with literature findings that these are risk factors for coronary artery disease. This routine check-up would be vital to decide the further line of management for his symptoms  encompassing potential lifestyle modifications  medication review  and possible invasive procedures.   The team managing Mr. Williams would keep cardiovascular health as a prime focus  aiming to control his symptoms and delay the progression of the disease. It is also pertinent to involve Mr. Williams in his healthcare decisions  educating him about his disease  and expected outcomes to promote better overall care.

Narration: Today  we discuss the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a truck driver by profession currently experiencing symptoms consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD). According to literature  Caucasian males aged 60-69 years have a higher prevalence of CAD.  Slide 2: Medical History Patient's Past Medical History  • Hypertension • Dyslipidemia • Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus • Cigarette smoker (40 pack-years) • No known drug allergies.  Narration: The patient has a significant past medical history. He has been a long-time smoker  hypertensive  and carries a diagnosis of dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These are all recognized risk factors for CAD. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.  Slide 3: Clinical Presentation Signs and Symptoms  • Exertional chest pain (angina) • Shortness of breath • Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) • Difficulty in doing physical activities  Narration: Our patient presents with typical exertional chest pain that radiates to the left arm and jaw  which he describes as a heavy squeezing sensation or pressure. This is accompanied by shortness of breath  frequent episodes of excessive sweating  and decreased tolerance for physical activities - all classic symptoms of CAD.   Slide 4: Conclusion and Clinical Alerts • The patient's condition  compounded by his age  gender  history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia  makes him a high-risk patient for coronary artery disease.  • The patient must be thoroughly evaluated  including an EKG  cardiac enzymes  and possibly an exercise stress test to confirm the diagnosis  understand the disease severity  and devise an optimal management plan. • This case underscores the importance of managing modifiable cardiac risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and diabetes to prevent the development of CAD.   Narration: The confluence of risk factors present in our patient makes most clinicians highly suspicious of CAD. Facilitating a thorough clinical evaluation  including cardiac investigations  is a necessary next step. The presence of preventable risk factors in this case underscores the importance of comprehensive secondary prevention strategies in patients at high risk of developing CAD.
Coronary artery disease,1,30,Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male named Mr. Henry Brown. He was born and raised in Birmingham  Alabama  making him a part of the South Medicare Region in the U.S.  where the prevalent rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) is reportedly higher.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a significant past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  all of which are identifiable risk factors for CAD. He has been a smoker for approximately 40 years but quit five years ago. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.   Mr. Brown has been on medication for his hypertension and diabetes (Metformin 500mg twice daily and Lisinopril 40 mg daily) for the past ten years. His hypercholesterolemia has been managed by a statin (Atorvastatin 20 mg daily) and diet  but he admits difficulty in maintaining a healthy diet due to his cultural cooking traditions which are often high in sodium and fats.  Unfortunately  Mr. Brown has had minimal physical activity throughout his life due to the nature of his work (truck driving). He has a family history of CAD  with his father suffering a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  Mr. Brown was brought into the hospital after experiencing symptoms consistent with angina pectoris (chest pain  shortness of breath) for the past few weeks. The pain is described as pressure-like  located in the substernal region and occasionally radiating to the left arm and neck. The symptoms seemed to increase upon exertion (e.g.  climbing stairs) and relieved by rest.   On physical examination  Mr. Brown was documented as overweight (BMI: 29)  with a slightly raised blood pressure reading. He showed no signs of heart failure.  Overall  Mr. Brown's profile - older age  male gender  African American race  southern residency  uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  sedentary lifestyle  past smoking habit  and family history of CAD - places him at an elevated risk for CAD  as documented in medical literature. His current symptoms of exertional angina pectoris and elevated blood pressure further suggest possible underlying CAD. This preliminary diagnosis warrants further evaluation by diagnostic tests like an electrocardiogram (EKG) and possibly cardiac angiography for a confirmed diagnosis.
Coronary artery disease,1,31,Title: A Case Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information: A 62-year-old African-American male  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a three-month history of experiencing sporadically occurring tight  squeezing chest pain that radiates to his left arm. The patient also mentions shortness of breath during moderate physical activities  which were not a problem for him before.  Past Medical History: The patient admitted to a past history of high blood pressure diagnosed 10 years ago for which he takes Lisinopril  a family history of atherosclerosis  and heart disease. His father had sudden cardiac death at the age of 65. He quit smoking 6 years ago but smoked 1 pack per day for about 35 years. His brother  aged 67  has a history of myocardial infarction. Other than the hypertension  the patient has no previous history of cardiac diseases.   Life Style: The patient is an office worker and leads a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. He admits having an unbalanced diet consisting of high fat and carbohydrate content.  Recent History: Over the last two months  he noticed repeated episodes of chest pain and occasional shortness of breath  especially during the exertion or under stress. These pains usually reduce after rest.  Physical Examination: BMI 30 kg/m2  Blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg  Pulse 75 bpm regular. His lipid profiles show triglycerides 173 mg/dl  total cholesterol 230mg/dl  LDL 140mg/dl  and HDL 36mg/dl  fasting blood sugar 110mg/dl.  Impression on Presentation: The intermittent chest pain on exertion and relieved by rest suggests typical stable angina. The patient’s age  gender  race  family history of heart disease  history of hypertension  past smoking habit  sedentary lifestyle  unbalanced diet  and abnormal lipid profile are all risk factors that predispose him to coronary artery disease.  Clinical Plan: The findings from the patient's history and physical exam suggest that the patient may have coronary artery disease. Further investigations are warranted  including stress testing and potentially a coronary angiography. Consideration should also be given to optimizing the management of his risk factors including the enforcement of lifestyle modifications and adjustment or addition of medical therapy.  Acknowledgement: The details provided accurately reflect the potential demographic representation of patients with coronary artery disease based on literature reviews. African American males are found to have a relatively higher prevalence rate  and the disease typically presents around the age of 60 to 75. Risk factors like hypertension  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  unbalanced diet  and family history of heart disease are fairly characteristic.
Coronary artery disease,1,32,Title: Clinical Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease in a Hispanic Elderly Male Patient   Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity named Mr. Sanchez. He is a retired construction worker  married  father of two children  and a resident of Houston  Texas. He speaks both Spanish and English but is more comfortable in Spanish. He is a non-smoker but consumes alcohol occasionally.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Sanchez visited his healthcare provider due to recurrent episodes of chest pain that’s been intensifying over the past few days. He describes the pain as a severe heaviness in the middle of his chest  which occasionally radiates to his left arm and jaw. The discomfort tends to occur during physical exertion and is often relieved by rest.    Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both managed with lifestyle modification and medication (metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension). His father had a heart attack at age 50  indicating a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite these conditions  Mr. Sanchez is reportedly non-compliant with his prescribed medications and diet.  Recent Investigation Results: Recent lipid panel shows high LDL cholesterol levels (170 mg/dL) and low HDL cholesterol levels (35 mg/dL). Blood pressure is consistently high  averaging around 145/90 mmHg. Fasting glucose levels are elevated (155 mg/dL). Body Mass Index (BMI) is 30 kg/m^2 which indicates obesity.  Discussion: Given his symptoms and past medical history  Mr. Sanchez’s clinical presentation is suggestive of stable angina due to Coronary Artery Disease. Known risk factors include hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  diet non-compliance  and strong family history of CAD. The demographic profile is consistent with research  indicating a higher prevalence of CAD and related risk factors in Hispanic populations  particularly among men and individuals over 60. It is critical for Mr. Sanchez to better manage his risk factors to prevent CAD progression. 
Coronary artery disease,1,33,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile  Name: Mr. Smith Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Lansing  Michigan  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presented with complaints of intermittent chest pain  especially during physical activities  which subsides with rest. He mentioned feelings of pressure  tightness  and discomfort in his chest. He also reported associated symptoms of breathlessness  fatigue  and occasional bouts of dizziness. He has not reported any incidences of fainting or syncope.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been managed with medications for the past 10 years. He had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. His medical history also indicates presence of peripheral artery disease.   Lifestyle:  Mr. Smith has a diet rich in fats and processed foods with minimal daily physical activity. He has a past history of tobacco use but quit smoking approximately 15 years ago  although he occasionally indulges in moderate alcohol consumption. There is a family history of heart disease  with his father having passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72.  Investigations:  Laboratory tests indicate elevated LDL cholesterol levels and slightly increased blood sugar levels. Electrocardiogram revealed signs suggestive of decreased blood flow. An exercise stress test further indicated abnormal blood flow to the heart muscle.   This comprehensive patient profile  the existing cardiovascular risk factors  in conjunction with the results of medical investigations  leads to a working diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The patient is recommended to visit a cardiologist for further evaluation  which may include coronary angiography  and optimisation of management.   Note: It's important to remember that this presentation is typical of the average patient with coronary artery disease based on literature – predominantly older  male  and of Caucasian ethnicity. However  it is crucial to note coronary artery disease also affects women  people of all ages and demographics; therefore  risk factors and symptomatology may vary accordingly.
Coronary artery disease,1,34,Presentation of Patient Case: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male from an urban setting. His occupation involves sedentary office work  and his financial status is middle-income category. He is married and has a family history of heart diseases.  Past Medical History: The patient has a longstanding history of hypertension and diabetes  both of which have been managed with oral and injectable medications respectively for ten years. In the last three years  the patient has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia with a consistently high level of LDL cholesterol. He also had a transient ischemic attack about a year ago  which was promptly managed and did not result in any significant morbidity or disability. His regular medications include a statin  antihypertensive medication  insulin  and an antiplatelet agent.  Lifestyle Habits:  The patient has a 40 pack-year smoking history but managed to quit about five years ago. His diet is predominantly high in fats and carbohydrates. He has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity; reportedly less than 90 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Alcohol history reveals moderate consumption. He has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30  which indicates obesity.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient arrived at the hospital with chief complaints of shortness of breath and chronic stable chest discomfort usually induced by physical exertion and stress but relieved by rest or Nitroglycerin use. The chest discomfort is typically described as a pressure or heaviness in the central chest  radiating to the left arm.   This patient fits the demographic profile of CAD patients as found in most epidemiological studies  where there's a higher prevalence of CAD in males over 60  and an escalated risk in African Americans. Furthermore  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and smoking are all well-established risk factors for CAD  and the patient's lifestyle choices  including a poor diet  physical inactivity  and obesity have certainly contributed to his condition. The adherence to the medications and control of comorbidities is essential to slower progression of CAD. Given his age  ethnicity  and medical history  this patient falls into a high-risk category  warranting immediate evaluation and a comprehensive cardiac risk reduction strategy.

Coronary artery disease,1,35,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)   Patient Profile: James Bell  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents a unique case of coronary artery disease. James resides in a suburban setting in Austin  Texas  with his wife. He is a retired computer analyst and has a stable socio-economic background. James falls under the demographic group that represents the highest prevalence of coronary artery disease  as data suggests that more than half of patients affected are Caucasian males  primarily aged 65 and above.  Medical History: James has a significant medical history notable for hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago and Type II diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago. Both conditions are well-controlled through medication and lifestyle modifications. However  it can be observed that his past medical history puts him at greater risk of developing CAD  as both hypertension and diabetes are prominent risk factors. There's no family history of coronary artery disease.  Presenting Complaint: James visited the clinic reporting recent episodes of chest discomfort. These episodes  characteristically described as a feeling of pressure or tightness in his chest  primarily occur when he engages in physical activities or is under emotional stress but relieves with rest. He sometimes experiences shortness of breath and occasional fatigue but denies having symptoms suggestive of heart failure such as edema  prominent nocturnal symptoms  or weight gain.  Social History: James is a former smoker  with a history of 20 pack-years; however  he quit smoking ten years ago. He drinks alcohol socially but within recommended limits. James lives a sedentary lifestyle  with very little regular physical activity.  Screening: Blood pressure: 130/80 mmHg BMI: 30 (Obese) Fasting glucose: 125 mg/dL Total cholesterol: 220 mg/dL Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): 150 mg/dL High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): 45 mg/dL  Conclusion: James’s symptoms  age  gender  race  medical history  and lifestyle choices altogether pose a high risk for the development or progression of Coronary Artery Disease. Working on lifestyle and dietary changes  maintaining regular medications and constant monitoring will be imperative. In this context  further evaluation and appropriate intervention will be pivotal in managing his condition and improving his quality of life.
Coronary artery disease,1,36,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Insurance: Medicare Place of Residence: Urban region  Florida  Presentation: Mr. Doe presents with a six-month history of angina which has been progressively worsening. The angina is typically precipitated by physical exertion and lasts approximately 5-10 minutes. It is characterized by a heavy  pressure-like sensation in the center of the chest  occasionally radiating to the left arm. The pain is often relieved by rest and/or sublingual nitroglycerin medication.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Type II diabetes ten years ago; it is adequately controlled on metformin therapy. His other major comorbidity is hypertension which is controlled with lisinopril. Approximately five years ago  he was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and prescribed atorvastatin which the patient admits to taking irregularly.  Lifestyle factors: Mr. Doe smoked for 30 years  averaging one pack a day but quit 15 years ago. He reports having a moderate alcohol intake of about 30 units per week. His diet is high in sodium and saturated fats with limited fruits and vegetables intake. He admits he is relatively sedentary with minimal physical exercise.  Family History: There is a notable family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and his older brother  who is 68  having undergone coronary artery bypass grafting due to extensive coronary artery disease.  In summary  Mr. Doe is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of type II diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. He presents with a classic history of progressive angina  suggestive of a severe underlying coronary artery disease. His risk factors include a former smoking habit  excess alcohol intake  poor diet  lack of exercise  and irregular medication adherence.  Mr. Doe's presentation aligns with trends observed in the prevalence of coronary artery disease in the US  which is often higher in individuals with similar demographic characteristics  lifestyle factors  and comorbidity profile. It also exemplifies the need for comprehensive lifestyle modifications and compliance with medication management in addition to medical intervention.
Coronary artery disease,1,37,Title: Presentation of a Male Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction:  Today  we bring into focus a 62-year-old African American male  a demographic proven by studies to have a high prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The patient is a resident of Philadelphia's urban region  Pennsylvania. As identified in literature  the social determinants of health in an urban setting  such as lifestyle  socio-economic status  and access to health care  often contribute significantly to the onset and progression of CAD.  Demographics:  The patient is retired and has a low-income status with his previous occupation being in the manual labor field. He has completed high school education. He is unmarried and currently lives alone  with a son who visits him occasionally.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 48  Type 2 diabetes mellitus at the age of 53  and high cholesterol levels at the age of 59. Each of these conditions appears to be under control with consistent use of medication. However  his poor diet and sedentary lifestyle heighten the risks. Further  he has a 20-year history of smoking  but he quit 5 years ago.   Family History:  Our patient's family history reveals an elevated risk of CAD. His late father suffered from the same disease  and his mother had high blood pressure.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient complains of recurring chest pain for the past few months  especially during physical exertion and emotional stress. He also experiences shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional episodes of indigestion.  Conclusion:  Taking into account his demographic information  previous medical history  family history of CAD  and current symptoms  CAD is a significant concern. Adequate consideration is necessary for these details during clinical assessment and treatment plan formulation for this patient.  This case highlights the importance of adequate focus on high-risk subsets of the population (like African-American males in the age group of 40-65 years  residing in urban settings) with early intervention and proactive measures being key in managing CAD prevalence effectively. 
Coronary artery disease,1,38,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile:  The case at hand involves Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Wilkes-Barre  Pennsylvania. As per the census data  coronary artery disease (CAD) is primarily prevalent among older adult White males in America. This demographic portrait aligns with Mr. Smith's profile.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has struggled with a few health issues over the past years  gaining clinical relevance in the assessment of his current situation. Diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension ten years ago  Mr. Smith has been getting his regular check-ups while adhering to prescribed medication. With an extensive family history of heart diseases as both his father and grandfather succumbed to heart attacks  Mr. Smith was always at high risk for cardiovascular ailments.  His other relevant histories include hyperlipidemia  which increases the risk of CAD  and a 30-pack-year history of smoking  adding another significant risk factor for CAD. Five years back  he also suffered a mild ischemic stroke but recovered well without any lingering neurological deficits.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith recently visited his primary care doctor complaining of recurrent chest discomfort over the last two months. He reports experiencing pressure-like discomfort in the mid-sternum area during exertional activities. These symptoms  associated with exertion and relieved by rest  suggest stable angina  a common presentation of CAD.  Overweight with a sedentary lifestyle  Mr. Smith’s physical examination indicates mild obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. The quick examination reveals an elevated blood pressure reading of 150/90 mmHg.  These symptoms  coupled with the patient's medical history and demographic  point towards a probable case of CAD  warranting further investigation. The immediate line of action includes confirming the diagnosis with an electrocardiogram (ECG)  lipid profile  fasting glucose  and if required  more conclusive imaging studies. Mr. Smith's treatment plan will then be individualized to his cardiovascular risk and tailored to best manage his CAD. This plan may involve lifestyle modifications  pharmacological intervention  and if necessary  invasive procedures.    Disclaimer: Please note that while this case represents a typical patient with coronary artery disease  individual patient presentations can vary significantly based on their unique medical history  risk factors  and symptoms. Early diagnosis and a tailored approach to treatment are key elements of effective CAD management. 
Coronary artery disease,1,39,Presentation of Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  I. Demographics  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male named John Stuart  a retired engineer from New York  New York. According to census data  Caucasians aged 65 and above constitute a significant portion of those diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Mr. Stuart is married  living with his wife in a suburban community and has two adult children. He has a high school education and his through his past employment  had sufficient access to medical care all his life.   II. Medical History  Significant aspects of Mr. Stuart's medical history include a 40-year history of cigarette smoking  although he quit five years ago. He has a consistent medical history of stage 2 hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which he has managed for the past 20 years with medication  including Atorvastatin and Lisinopril. However  his adherence to medication routines and lifestyle modifications has not been consistent.  He also has a family history of heart disease  specifically  his father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. No history of diabetes mellitus but there is presence of obesity (BMI: 32 kg/m2)  increasing his risk factor for CAD.   III. Symptoms  John presents with a classical symptom of chest pain  which has been particularly prominent over the last two weeks. The pain  often left-sided  is described as heavy and constrictive  occurring mostly upon moderate exertion like climbing upstairs or walking for long distances and relieved by rest. He occasionally experiences shortness of breath during these episodes.   IV. Diagnosis  The primary diagnosis  considering his demographic and medical history coupled with his symptoms  is Coronary Artery Disease. The next step would be further evaluation with EKG and stress tests  followed by potential coronary angiography to confirm diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease.   To summarize  demographic details of age  ethnicity  family history  personal risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  and specific symptoms contribute to the patient's high probability of CAD. His demographic representation is consistent with epidemiological data on CAD which presents a higher prevalence among the elderly  males  and those with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and physical inactivity.
Coronary artery disease,1,40,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Profile:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired from working as an engineer  and currently residing in the suburban areas of Boston  Massachusetts. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol but has a deliberate consumption of a diet rich in carbohydrates and fats. He leads a sedentary lifestyle having limited physical activities.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension about 10 years ago. He has been managing these conditions with regular medications and routine follow-ups with internal medicine. He was diagnosed and treated for high cholesterol levels 5 years ago. His BMI is 28  placing him in the overweight category. His father had a history of premature coronary artery disease  having experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 50.   Current Presentation:  Recently  Mr. Smith consulted his doctor about recurrent episodes of chest pain that generally occur on exertion  like when climbing stairs or carrying groceries  and are relieved with a period of rest. This has been associated with occasional shortness of breath. No associated palpitations  dizziness  or syncope was reported. The chest pain has progressively been becoming frequent and prolonged over the past month. These symptoms are consistent with stable angina.  Conclusion:  Mr. Smith exhibits several risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) which include: age  male sex  personal medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia  genetic predisposition due to a family history of CAD  and lifestyle factors such as an unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise. His symptoms indicate a potential onset of CAD which should be managed with prompt investigations and treatment. 
Coronary artery disease,1,41,Title: A Case Study of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Demographic Information:  Mr. Grayson Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who resides in a small suburban town in the Midwest United States. He is a retired mechanical engineer and is currently living with his wife of 45 years. Mr. Smith mostly spends his time gardening and taking short walks  however  he is a former smoker who quit the habit a decade ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of the same at an early age.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus around 15 years ago  and he also has a known history of hypertension for the past ten years. Both conditions have been relatively well controlled with medications.  He first experienced symptoms of angina five years ago  which were confirmed to be due to coronary artery disease (CAD) through angiography. Since then  Mr. Smith has been on aspirin  statins  and beta-blockers for the management of CAD.  Mr. Smith also has occasional episodes of heartburn that is managed with over-the-counter antacids. He had a cholecystectomy more than 20 years ago. His other surgical history includes an appendectomy during his childhood and a hip replacement surgery about eight years ago. He maintains a regimen of annual flu vaccines and he received a pneumococcal vaccine five years ago.  Mr. Smith's high-risk factors include his age  being male  possessing a genetic disposition to CAD  being a former smoker  and having a personal history of diabetes and hypertension. These factors make him an excellent example of the type of person who commonly presents with CAD  as suggested by a wide body of literature.  Current Presentation:  He presented to the clinic today with complaints of increased frequency of chest pain over the last two weeks. The pain is typically precipitated by activity and relieved by rest  following the pattern of stable angina. However  the episodes are more frequent and are unrelieved by his usual medications.  Physical examination showed an overweight male with a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 78 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 95% in room air. Cardiovascular exam noted regular rhythm without murmurs. There was mild lower limb edema.   Given his current symptoms and Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was sent for further evaluation to assess the progression of his CAD.

Coronary artery disease,1,44,Title: A Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics:  Patient Mr. X is a 65-year-old African American male residing in New York  USA. He is retired and previously worked as a factory worker. He's a long term smoker  with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He drinks alcohol occasionally and has an inactive lifestyle with minimal physical activity. He lives with wife in their suburban home.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a significant past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed with medications for the past 15 years. He also has a family history of heart disease; his father passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 70. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol ten years ago  and since then he has been on and off statin therapy due to cost issues. He has early-stage chronic kidney disease diagnosed five years ago  currently managed by diet modification.  Current Presentation:  Mr. X presented to the clinic with persistent chest heaviness and shortness of breath that started several weeks ago. The pain radiates to his left arm and occasionally to his neck. This occurs particularly when he exerts himself  but lately  it has also happened when he's resting. He often feels light-headed and has excessive sweating during these episodes.   Notes:  This presentation is typical of a patient presenting with coronary artery disease. Studies show that African-American men  in particular  have the highest risk for coronary artery disease  compared to other racial backgrounds. The patient’s advanced age  history of poor glycemic control  long-term smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and male gender are all contributory risk factors seen in literature. Furthermore  the exacerbating factors such as exertion are typical of angina  a clinical manifestation of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,1,45,Title: A Case Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Male - Age: 65 - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  formerly in a managerial role - Smoking Status: Ex-smoker  quit 10 years ago - Alcohol: Occasional drinker - Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle  Presenting Complaint:  The patient arrived at the clinic citing increasing episodes of substernal chest pain typically brought on by physical exertion over the past six months. There has been an increased frequency in these episodes in the past two weeks.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 8 years ago  which he controls through oral medication and diet. He also has hypertension for the past 10 years  which he manages with daily antihypertensive medication. The patient mentions he is compliant with medication. His other past medical history includes hyperlipidemia and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease 3 years ago for which he has been on low-dose aspirin. He also had an appendectomy in his early 20s.   Family History:  The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 62 and his paternal uncle underwent coronary artery bypass surgery at 65. His mother has type 2 diabetes and his older sister suffers from rheumatoid arthritis.  Medications:  - Metformin 1000mg Twice daily - Lisinopril 10mg Daily - Atorvastatin 20mg Daily - Aspirin 81mg Daily  The patient's symptoms indicate potential Coronary Artery Disease. Given his age  gender  past medical history  and family history  his risk factors align closely with common demographics of CAD patients. Specifically  his type 2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking could contribute significantly to coronary artery disease development.  Physical Examination:  - Blood pressure: 145/90 mmHg - Weight: 210 lbs - BMI: 28 - Heart rate: 78 beats/min and regular - Respiratory rate: 16 breaths/min  Cardiovascular examination revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. However  his high blood pressure and slightly elevated heart rate are a concern and indicative of increased workload on the heart.  The patient has been advised to undergo further diagnostic tests  including ECG and coronary angiography  to confirm the presence and extent of Coronary Artery Disease and to guide appropriate management.
Coronary artery disease,1,46,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction: Good day  everyone. Our case for today involves a patient suffering from Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   Demographics:  Our patient  Mr. Robertson  is a 65-year-old Caucasian Male  retired civil engineer  residing in Phoenix  Arizona. He is married with two adult children.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Robertson presented to the clinic complaining of recurring chest pain (angina) characterized mainly by a sense of pressure  tightness  or aching across the chest  usually appearing when performing strenuous activities or under emotional distress. In addition  he complained of breathlessness even after normal daily activities like climbing stairs.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Robertson has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years  which are known risk factors for coronary artery disease. He is also known to have hypercholesterolemia and a 20-year history of smoking  having quit 5 years ago. He had an episode of myocardial infarction 3 years ago and had been stably controlled on medication (aspirin  statins  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers) until recently.  Family History:  Mr. Robertson has a strong familial predisposition to cardiovascular disorders. His father suffered a fatal heart attack at age 56  and his older brother has been diagnosed with CAD.   Lifestyle:  Despite being a non-smoker now  his past smoking history significantly contributes to his cardiovascular risk. He has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise and dietary habits more inclined towards processed and high-fat food.  Summary:  Taken together  Mr. Robertson's advanced age  male gender  past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  as well as his smoking history and family history  all significantly place him at a higher risk for developing CAD. His current physical manifestation of angina and breathlessness further supports the diagnosis. Prompt management involving pharmaceutical intervention  lifestyle modifications  and possibly accompanied by invasive procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be required to prevent severe complications such as myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac arrest. 
Coronary artery disease,1,47,"Slide 1: Introduction  Patient X is a 65-year-old African American male who presents with coronary artery disease (CAD)  also known as ischemic heart disease. This case study highlights the prevalence of CAD among older  African American males  which is demonstrative of the wider trend within the medical literature.   Slide 2: Patient Profile  The patient is a retired engineer  weighing 220 pounds at a height of 5'8""""  making his Body Mass Index (BMI) 33.4 which falls into the obese category. He lives in an urban environment with a high prevalence of smoking and poor diet. He has a history of moderate alcohol consumption but has been abstinent for ten years.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Patient X has a history of hypertension  diagnosed ten years ago  and type 2 diabetes  diagnosed five years ago. Both conditions are currently controlled with medication (metformin for diabetes and a diuretic for hypertension). Additionally  the patient has had high cholesterol levels for the past seven years. His family history includes a father who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and a mother who has hypertension.   Slide 4: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) History  The patient was diagnosed with CAD five years ago  shortly after his diagnosis of diabetes. His diagnosis was confirmed by angiography  which showed a 50% blockage of his left anterior descending artery.   Slide 5: Current Presentation  Patient X currently presents with complaints of occasional  mild chest pain  usually after exertion. He also reports experiencing shortness of breath during moderate physical activity  such as walking up a flight of stairs  but not at rest.    Slide 6: Conclusion  Given his age  ethnicity  obesity  presence of hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol levels  and his family’s cardiac history  patient X's profile fits the demographic pattern typically associated with CAD. His symptoms of occasional chest discomfort and shortness of breath indicate a continued progression of the disease  underscoring the importance of ongoing management and lifestyle modifications."
Coronary artery disease,1,48,Good Afternoon   Our patient today  Mr. John Smith  is a 65-year-old African American male who has come in complaining of sporadic chest pain  fatigue  and shortness of breath for the past month. His symptoms have progressively been worsening over time. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  which has been treated with medication for the past ten years.   In his lifestyle  Mr. Smith is a retired bus driver and has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit smoking around 10 years ago. He admits to exercising infrequently and follows a diet high in processed foods and saturated fats. Mr. Smith is overweight with a BMI of 29 with a history of minimal weight loss attempts. He lives in a suburban area with his wife of 40 years and has three adult children.   On taking a more detailed history  he mentions a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 59  and his elder brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his early 60s.  His primary care physician has been managing his past medical conditions  but over the last three months  his blood pressure and cholesterol levels show little improvement despite medication  compliance  and dosage increases.   Based on his symptoms and past medical history  it is highly suggestive of the development of coronary artery disease. Further cardiac diagnostic tests have been recommended  such as electrocardiogram  stress testing  and an angiogram for a definitive diagnosis.   This case brings to light the enhanced risk factor for coronary artery disease in African American males over 60 with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a lifestyle that encompasses unhealthy dietary choices and physical inactivity.   For Mr. Smith  a multi-pronged approach should be considered involving lifestyle changes  medication adjustments  and possibly  depending on the results of his tests  interventional procedures. It is crucial for him to understand his condition  the need for improved lifestyle behaviors  and potential impacts if left untreated.   Thank you for your attention to Mr. Smith's case. Please feel free to comment and suggest further actions in his treatment plan.
Coronary artery disease,1,49,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in 65-Year-Old African American Male   Good day  everyone.   Today I present to you Mr. James Thompson  a 65-year-old African American male who presented with exertional chest pain which he describes as 'squeezing' in nature  radiating to his left arm  and associated with shortness of breath. The chest discomfort is usually relieved by rest. He states he has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two months but they have now been increasing in frequency and intensity.  Mr. Thompson works as a high school teacher and he is married with two children. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history but stopped 10 years ago. He comes from a low socio-economic background  has limited physical activity  and is frequently under stress. He admits to a diet high in sodium and saturated fats.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed with medication. He has a family history of heart disease and stroke on the paternal side. He has been non-compliant with his regular health checkups.   Mr. Thompson represents a prototypical example of an individual at high risk for coronary artery disease. African American descent tends to worsen this risk due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in their population. His prior history of smoking  alongside stress  poor diet  and inadequate physical activity  contributes to his increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Early intervention strategies through lifestyle modifications and appropriate medications  as well as regular health checkups  are key to managing Mr. Thompson's condition and to prevent the progression of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,1,50,Title: Coronary Artery Disease Presentation in an Elderly Male Patient   Presentation:  The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male who resides in the suburban region of the Midwest  United States. The patient presents with a chief complaint of persistent chest pain particularly more severe on physical exertion  shortness of breath  and fatigue  which have persisted over the last few weeks.   Demographically  males over the age of 60 are an at-risk group for coronary artery disease (CAD)  especially in developed regions such as the United States. Ethnic background is also a relevant factor as Caucasian populations have been found to have a higher risk compared to other races.  Upon medical evaluation  the patient reported a past medical history notable for hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  and managed with amlodipine. He also reported being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus  6 years ago  which is controlled with Metformin. It is well-documented in medical literature that both these conditions can significantly increase the risk for CAD.  The patient is also a former smoker  having quit approximately 15 years ago  but had a 30 pack-year smoking history prior. Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for developing CAD.  The patient admits a family history of heart disease  with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at age 72. The family history puts him at a higher genetic risk for CAD.  Regarding lifestyle  the patient follows a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity and admits that his diet is relatively high in trans fats and cholesterol  which increases his risk for CAD. He consumes alcohol moderately.  On examination  the patient was overweight with a BMI of 28  showing symptoms of angina pectoris during a stress test.  In conclusion  CAD has been deeply explored through research  and its strong associations with age  gender  race  hypertension  diabetes  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and family history have been noted. Our patient falls into several of these demographic and medical categories that make him high-risk for CAD. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are being planned for an effective treatment course.
Coronary artery disease,1,51,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Introduction: Today  we are presenting a case study of a patient diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease. This case provides an opportunity to understand the clinical presentation  risk factors  management  and prognosis of CAD.  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith from a suburban neighborhood in Boston  Massachusetts. He is a retired mechanical engineer who has been retired for about five years now. He is married and lives with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension for the past ten years  managed with Lisinopril. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol and has been on statin therapy (Simvastatin). He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is controlled with Metformin. He was a smoker but quit about 15 years ago when he was diagnosed with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His family history includes CAD  with his father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith presented with a chief complaint of progressive  severe chest pain during exertion  usually relieved with rest  which started approximately six months ago. The pain is located in the center of the chest and is described as pressure-like. There is no radiation of pain. He also admits to experiencing shortness of breath and occasional episodes of dizziness. In the past two weeks  these symptoms have become more frequent.  Clinical Assessment: On physical examination  Mr. Smith's blood pressure was 145/92 mmHg  pulse 78 bpm  BMI 28  O2 saturation 95% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed no gallops or murmurs  and lungs had minimal wheezing. Laboratory results showed elevated LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL and HbA1c was 7.2%. ILD showed no acute pathology. An EKG showed ST-segment depression in the anterolateral leads. Troponin levels were normal.   Conclusion: Given Mr. Smith's age  gender  personal medical history  family history  and presenting symptoms  the diagnosis of stable angina due to coronary artery disease was made. The next step of management includes obtaining a coronary angiography for accurate visualization of coronary artery occlusion and making decisions about revascularization strategies like stenting or bypass surgery. His risk factors such as poor blood pressure control  elevated LDL levels  and uncontrolled diabetes need to be addressed as well. His case emphasizes the importance of aggressive management of modifiable risk factors in patients presenting CAD.

Coronary artery disease,1,52,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  I. Introduction Today  we present the case of a patient diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  II. Demographic Information  Patient X is a 66-year-old Caucasian male  retired and currently living with his wife. A recent US study reports that CAD incidence rates are highest among white males aged 65-74.  III. Presentation He has recently started experiencing chest pain or discomfort that feels like a tight ache  heavy pressure  or crushing pain. The pain can be felt anywhere from the patient's upper body  particularly on the left side and it occasionally radiates to his arms. Along with chest discomfort  the patient has also experienced shortness of breath  fatigue  sweatiness  and lightheadedness. Furthermore  he has reported having episodes of angina - a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.  IV. Past Medical History Patient X has a significant past medical history. He was diagnosed with borderline hypertension and dyslipidemia roughly ten years back  and has been managing these conditions with diet modification and physical activity. He has been a smoker for 40 years but quit ten years ago.   His father passed away at age 59 due to a heart attack  highlighting a family history of heart disease  which contributes significantly to his risk profile.   V. Assessment The combination of his age  sex  personal and family medical history  and clinical presentation leads us to consider CAD as a plausible diagnosis for Patient X. He has undergone a series of diagnostic tests  including electrocardiogram  stress test  echocardiogram  and coronary angiography.  VI. Conclusion Understanding the demographic and clinical profile of our patient will aid in tailoring a proper evidence-based and patient-centered management plan for our patient. Such management plans may include lifestyle changes  medications  and potentially angioplasty or bypass surgery.  It's essential to monitor his condition  given that CAD is a chronic disease and the world's leading cause of death. Patient education about his condition and treatment will also play a pivotal role in improving his symptoms and quality of life.
Coronary artery disease,1,53,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction: Today  we present a case of coronary artery disease (CAD)  a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.   Case Presentation: The patient is Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male residing in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. He is a retired construction worker and a Vietnam War veteran. He is married with two grown children and is a lifetime non-smoker  though he does consume alcohol moderately  possibly one to two drinks per occasion. He was referred by his primary care physician after experiencing chest pain during his routine morning walks.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which have been managed adequately with medication for the past 15 years. Moreover  he has dyslipidemia  for which he has been prescribed statins. Regrettably  his adherence to medication and routine check-ups has been inconsistent. His family history is remarkable for early-onset coronary artery disease – his father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 58. There is no history of stroke or other vascular diseases in the family. According to the CDC  CAD prevalence is more concentrated among non-Hispanic blacks  especially men and those over the age of 65  reflecting Mr. Doe's demographics.  Presenting Complaints and Signs: Mr. Doe presents complaining of an intermittent  central  squeezing chest pain that radiates to the left arm. These episodes typically last 5-10 minutes and are provoked by physical exertion  like his morning walks  and relieved by rest. Classic symptoms like these are commonly seen in patients with stable angina  a common presentation of CAD.  Discussion: This case highlights CAD as a common problem among elderly African American males with comorbid conditions like hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia. Increased awareness of risk factors and compliance with recommended pharmacotherapy is an essential patient-centered approach to managing this disease. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a regular exercise routine  modifying diet  and ensuring regular follow-ups to monitor disease progress effectively.   Conclusion: Early identification and management of risk factors for CAD can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. It is also key to identify potential barriers to adherence to treatment that might exist for patients within this demographic  thus requiring personalized care strategies.
Coronary artery disease,1,54,Title: A Case Presentation of A Patient with Coronary Artery Disease   Introduction:   Today we present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a significant medical history  who has been recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Smith is a retired mechanical engineer who lives with his wife in Springfield  Illinois. He is originally from the United States  of Caucasian descent  which places him within the largest ethnic demographic affected by CAD. According to recent research  CAD is the leading cause of mortality nationwide  especially affecting Caucasian males.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has been a smoker for the past 40 years  approximating about a pack per day  which significantly elevated his risk for CAD. He also has a known history of hypertension and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years  both of which are under control with medication. Mr. Smith also has a family history significant for heart disease; his father had myocardial infarction at the age of 55.  Apart from the cardiac-related history  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with benign prostate hyperplasia  5 years ago  which is currently under management with drugs. There is no known history of any allergies. He consumes alcohol moderately and denies any illicit drug use.  Recent Clinical History:  Mr. Smith visited his primary care physician with complaints of chest discomfort and shortness of breath that occur during exertion and relieved by resting. These symptoms were particularly noticeable when he was going up the stairs or during cold weather and have been progressively getting worse over the last few months. His Electrocardiogram showed ST-T segment changes suggestive of ischemia  and his subsequent stress test was positive for myocardial ischemia  leading to the diagnosis of CAD.   His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31  putting him in the category of obesity  which is another risk factor for CAD. His lipid profile also revealed elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides  and reduced HDL-Cholesterol level.   Conclusion:  Mr. Smith's demographic details  longitudinal medical history  lifestyle factors  and family history reflect a typical presentation of a patient at risk of CAD. It is clear that persistent smoking  obesity  poorly managed hypertension  and Type-2 Diabetes are significant risk factors for the development of CAD.   This case offers an opportunity to discuss CAD's preventive strategies  lifestyle modifications  and treatment strategies  emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing patients with CAD.   Mr. Smith has been referred to a cardiologist for a further management plan  which may include angiography for further assessment and potential angioplasty or bypass surgery given his significant cardiac risk factors.
Coronary artery disease,1,55,Patient Presentation:   I would like to present a case of a patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith hails from a middle-class suburban neighborhood in Boston  Massachusetts.  He is a former smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit about ten years ago. He has no known drug allergies and does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs. He is married  retired  and lives with his wife. He reports to be relatively sedentary since his retirement  with diet largely consisting of high fat and cholesterol-rich foods.   Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history. He has been treated for hypertension for the past 10 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years  both of which are under somewhat control with medication (Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes). He also has a family history of heart disease; his father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 60.  In terms of his CAD  Mr. Smith has been experiencing chronic stable angina for the past six months  usually with moderate to high-intensity activities. The pain is typically relieved by rest or Nitroglycerin tablets. He reports no symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath  fatigue  or fluid retention.   His worsening symptoms and high-risk factors for CAD prompted further investigations  including an electrocardiogram (ECG) that showed T-wave inversion  and a coronary angiogram  which confirmed the diagnosis of CAD. He has significant stenosis in two of his coronary arteries.  His current medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  Aspirin  a statin (Atorvastatin)  and Nitroglycerin (as needed).  In summary  Mr. Smith is representative of the demographic and health history commonly associated with CAD: an older  sedentary  male  ex-smoker with hypertension  diabetes  and unhealthy diet  as well as a family history of heart disease.
Coronary artery disease,1,56,Title: Case Presentation: A 68-Year-Old Male Muslim Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  I. Chief Compliant: Mr.Abdul Rahman  a 68-year-old Muslim male from the UAE  presented to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain that worsens with exertion and relieved by rest  shortness of breath  and increased fatigue in the past three weeks.  II. Demographics: Mr. Rahman  originally from Abu Dhabi  is an ex-smoker (45 pack years)  and his diet is predominantly of high trans-fat food  reflecting a trend towards unhealthy lifestyle practices commonly seen in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). His family history is significant  with his father having suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  III. Medical and Surgical History: His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both being managed pharmacologically for the past ten years. He had appendectomy when he was 20 with no post-surgical complications.  IV. Medications: The patient is under medication for his pre-existing medical conditions  which includes Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes  and Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide 20-25 mg once daily for hypertension.  V. Physical Examination and Diagnostic Evaluation: On examination  his vital parameters were stable  but he demonstrated signs of peripheral edema  possibly indicative of congestive cardiac failure. His cholesterol levels were found to be above normal range. In the diagnostic evaluation  an ECG indicated possible ischemia. His stress test confirmed positive for myocardial ischemia  and on further evaluation  the coronary angiogram revealed significant blockage in his coronary arteries.  VI. Summary: Coronary Artery Disease is a predominant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and has been linked to lifestyles  diet  and genetic predisposition. For Mr. Rahman  it appears the disease may have been a progression from his untreated hypertension  diabetes  and unhealthy lifestyle. His case emphasizes the need for early detection and continuous monitoring of conditions predisposing individuals for heart diseases in high-risk demographics. His treatment options will include lifestyle changes  medications  and possibly surgical intervention. To efficiently manage his condition  a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  dietetics  and endocrinology will be sought. Also  consideration of his ethnic and religious beliefs is imperative in the holistic management of his condition.

Coronary artery disease,1,60,Title: A Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Profile: The patient is Mr. John Doe  a 67-year-old African American male residing in urban Chicago  Illinois. He is retired  married and has three adult children. He has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years  although he quit ten years ago.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe's medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which was diagnosed 15 years ago. He has been managing his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. He had been diagnosed with moderate hypertension five years ago for which he has been taking antihypertensive medication. He also has a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD); his father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 72.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe reported experiencing episodes of chest pain  primarily on exertion. This has been happening for a span of three months. The episodes usually last for less than ten minutes and are relieved by rest. The chest pain is described as a “heavy” feeling  located in the central chest  and often radiates to his left arm. Besides  he has lately been having shortness of breath on exertion  easy fatigue  and occasional light-headedness. There is no associated nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis.  On further questioning  the patient admitted to having poor dietary habits  high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables. His physical activity is minimal mostly due to his recent retirement and the aforementioned chest discomfort. Mr Doe admitted that he does not regularly follow up with his doctor and therefore  his medications are not always taken as prescribed due to low health literacy.  This patient’s demographic  comorbidities  family history and lifestyle all contribute to his risk of developing CAD. African American race  male gender  advanced age  diabetes  hypertension  family history of CAD  and a past smoking history have all been identified as risk factors for CAD as per literature review. This case serves as an example of the need for vigilant screening and early intervention to manage CAD in similar high-risk populations. Additionally  it underlines the importance of health literacy in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.
Coronary artery disease,1,61,Title: Patient Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease   Introduction:  I will be presenting a case of a 62-year-old African American male with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD). Research consistently shows that CAD exhibits a higher prevalence in males and the rates increase with age.

Coronary artery disease,1,65,Title: Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in an Elderly Male Patient  Introduction:   I present to you Mr. Patrick  a 68-year-old African American male  living in a suburban setting with his wife. He is a retired truck driver with a history of smoking for the last 45 years  although he quit smoking seven years ago. His BMI (Body Mass Index) is 28.4  implying that he is overweight.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Patrick was diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ten years ago. His hypertension is managed with a daily dose of lisinopril and his diabetes with metformin and lifestyle modifications. He also has a history of hyperlipidaemia  managed with the use of statins. Mr. Patrick underwent a cholecystectomy eight years ago because of gallstones. He had a minor stroke four years before  from which he fully recovered with no residual deficits.  Presenting Conditions:  He came to the hospital with complaints of increasingly severe chest pain over the last six months. The chest pain is primarily exertional and gets relieved by rest  suggesting angina pectoris. He also reports experiencing shortness of breath  fatigue during minimal exertion  and an occasional light-headedness. Family history reveals that both his father and one of his older brothers suffered from coronary artery disease (CAD).   Considering Mr. Patrick's advanced age  his history of uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and a positive family history  all these contributing factors make him a high-risk candidate for coronary artery disease.   Conclusion:   Close clinical examination  relevant investigations  risk mitigation  and appropriate medical therapy are of utmost priority to manage Mr. Patrick’s symptoms and prevent severe consequences like an acute coronary syndrome. It is also crucial to emphasize lifestyle modifications  including a balanced diet  regular exercise  and maintaining a healthy weight. Further investigation like an ECG and stress test is planned to establish the diagnosis  quantify the level of coronary obstruction  and plan out the further treatment course.
Coronary artery disease,1,66,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease    Today  I would like to present a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. John  who presented with typical signs of coronary artery disease (CAD). This demographic is chosen as coronary artery disease is most prevalent in white males over 55  as per the American Heart Association.  Patient Information: Mr. John is a retired construction worker living in an urban setting with his wife. He is of an average economic background and has a family history of coronary artery disease. No known allergies were reported.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. John presented with complaints of chest discomfort on exertion  increasing fatigue  and shortness of breath. He described his chest pain as a heavy or squeezing feeling in his chest and it seemed to worsen with activity and improving with rest. He also noticed some discomfort in his left arm.  Past Medical History: Mr. John has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  conditions which pose as significant risk factors for CAD. He is also a former smoker with a history of 30-pack years  quit 10 years ago. He has been on medication for his diabetes and hypertension  with variable compliance. There is no history of previous ischemic heart disease  stroke  or any other major health issues.  Lifestyle: He reports a sedentary lifestyle in his retirement with minimal physical activity. His diet is rich in fats and carbohydrates and has a moderate consumption of alcohol.  Physical Examination: His blood pressure on examination was found to be slightly raised at 145/90 mm Hg. Other physical findings were unremarkable.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed concerns for possible ischemic changes. Further cardiac stress testing and coronary angiography may be necessary for diagnosis confirmation.  In this case  Mr. John's age  gender  race  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  unhealthy diet  and family history of CAD all put him at higher risk for developing coronary artery disease.  Next Steps: To confirm CAD and to understand its severity  further investigations like a cardiac stress test  echocardiogram  and coronary angiography might be required. In terms of management  the patient would need personal lifestyle counselling supplemented with medical therapy to control his risk factors. In case of severe CAD  coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty may be considered.     That brings us to the end of this presentation of a patient with coronary artery disease symptoms. The next steps would focus on patient education  lifestyle modifications  and optimal medical therapy. These comprehensive approaches to care have been shown to significantly improve long-term patient outcomes.
Coronary artery disease,1,67,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Good day  colleagues. Today  I would like to present a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. Smith  who presented with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This demographic is chosen based on literature suggesting the prevalence of CAD is higher in men than in women and increases with age. Also  Caucasians are often more affected by CAD when compared with many other racial groups.  Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker  currently living in rural Tennessee  married with three adult children. He has a history of smoking for over 30 years but quit five years ago. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 29  indicating he is overweight. He takes no regular exercise and has a high-fat diet  which is common in his geographical locality.  He has a few significant aspects in his past medical history. Mr. Smith has been previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and has been managing his condition with Metformin for the last ten years. He has also been diagnosed with Hypertension six years ago and takes an ACE inhibitor daily. His father  a former smoker  was diagnosed with CAD at 62 and ultimately died from an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 66.  Over the past few weeks  Mr. Smith has noticed episodes of chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue  especially during physical activities. These symptoms led him to seek medical attention from our institution.  In summary  the demographic distribution of CAD largely portrays late middle-aged to elderly Caucasian males  particularly those with a history of smoking  poor diet  sedentary lifestyle  and a life course perspective of unfavourable economic conditions. The strong genetic predisposition  coupled with acquired comorbidities such as Diabetes and Hypertension  places this patient in a high-risk group for CAD. We aim to manage his disease in a way that prolongs life expectancy while improving the quality of life.
Coronary artery disease,1,68,Title: Coronary Artery Disease Clinical Presentation   Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. Carlos Rodriguez Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired auto mechanic Insurance: Medicare  Presenting Problem:   Mr. Rodriguez has been experiencing intermittent chest pain  fatigue  and shortness of breath  particularly on exertion  over the past couple of months.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant past medical history  which includes:  - Hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Lisinopril. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 8 years ago  managed with Metformin.  - Obesity with a BMI of 30. - Was a 30-year pack smoker but quit smoking about 5 years ago. - Family history of heart disease (father and older brother). - No previous diagnosis of heart diseases.   Social History:  Mr. Rodriguez is a widower  father to one daughter  and a grandfather to two grandchildren. He lives with his daughter and grandkids. He is a non-drinker. He is retired but attempts to maintain an active lifestyle.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Carlos appeared anxious. He had a blood pressure reading of 150/85 mmHg  a pulse of 72 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breath per minute. There were no notable cardiovascular abnormalities upon examination. His BMI was confirmed to be 30.  Based on his present symptoms  past medical history  age  and ethnicity  there is a high suspicion of coronary artery disease. Further diagnostics  including labs and imaging studies  have been suggested to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity.  Demographics Note: Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality among adults in the United States. It disproportionately affects males and individuals aged 65 and older. Additionally  certain ethnicities  including Hispanic populations  have increased risk due to higher prevalence of risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. The above presentation is an illustration of a typical patient who may present with coronary artery disease symptoms.   References will be provided upon request.
Coronary artery disease,1,69,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Richardson  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the office with complaints of gradually worsening exertional chest pain and frequent bouts of breathlessness over the past six months. He described the pain as a pressing sensation behind the sternum  often radiating to his left arm and occasional cold sweat. Mr. Richardson has a history of hypertension  diagnosed approximately five years ago and type 2 diabetes for seven years. Both are sub-optimally controlled. His daily medication includes Metformin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine.   He lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood and recently retired from his job as a banker. He has a 35-pack year smoking history but quit eight years ago. He admits to an unhealthy diet routine  rich in saturated fats  despite requests from his wife and healthcare provider to modify it.   His father suffered from a myocardial infarction at 55  and his mother is a known case of diabetes mellitus. He has one younger brother who has recently been diagnosed with hypertension. He also has four children  all of whom are currently healthy.  On physical examination  Mr. Richardson has a BMI of 29 kg/m². His blood pressure is 148/92 mmHg  respiratory rate is 18/min  pulse is 92 beats/min  and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally. His lower extremities indicate mild edema.  This presentation of chest pain coupled with his hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and family history suggest coronary artery disease. Further tests such as electrocardiography and potentially coronary angiography are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of his illness. A modification of lifestyle and re-evaluation of his current medication is necessary to manage his condition effectively. 
Coronary artery disease,1,70,Title: Patient Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She was raised and still resides in the Midwest of the United States. Her BMI is in the obese range at 32. She is a retired schoolteacher who currently lives with her husband. Her socioeconomic status is middle class. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30-year pack-a-day habit.  Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes 20 years ago  which has been managed effectively with medication and diet. She has a consistent record of hyperlipidemia over the past 14 years. High blood pressure was diagnosed 8 years back and has been inconsistently controlled through medication changes and diet. The patient is clinically obese and has struggled with weight throughout her lifetime. Unfortunately  her sedentary lifestyle doesn’t support weight loss. The patient had an ankle fracture requiring surgery 2 years ago and recovered well.  Concerns & Symptoms: She came to the clinic complaining about substernal chest discomfort during the past week  particularly when going for her daily walk or climbing stairs at her home  which resolves at rest. She also reported experiencing shortness of breath  occasional palpitations  and an increasing sense of fatigue. These symptoms  along with her personal and family history (her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 72)  collectively put her at significant risk for coronary artery disease (CAD).  Initial Conclusion: Considered in light of her age  gender  race  diabetes  smoking history  high blood pressure  high cholesterol  obesity  a sedentary lifestyle  and family history of heart disease  the presenting symptoms are concerning for stable angina related to coronary artery disease. The patient will be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and possible treatment intervention. Lifestyle modifications and strict control on diabetes and hypertension are advised along with angina-based medical therapy pending further clinical evaluations.
Coronary artery disease,1,71,Patient Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease  I. Demographics  Patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male residing in an urban setting. He is a retired machinist and a former smoker  having smoked for over 20 years  but reports cessation 10 years ago. Patient is overweight with a BMI of 30 and follows a diet high in saturated fats and sodium. His alcohol consumption is moderate.  II. Past Medical History   The patient has a documented history of hypertension which has been inconsistently controlled with antihypertensive medications. There is a familial history of heart disease as his father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 64. Additionally  the patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago and has been managing the condition with oral hypoglycemic agents. His compliance with medications and regular follow-ups has generally been poor due to a reported lack of perceived severity.  III. Presenting Symptoms  The patient has come for consultation related to worsening exertional chest pain that he has been experiencing for the past few months. The chest pain is described as a squeezing pressure sensation located centrally in his chest  radiating to his left arm. The discomfort usually arises with physical activity or emotional stress and subsides with rest or taking his prescribed nitroglycerin tablets. Recent episodes have been increasing in frequency and intensity. He also has associated symptoms of shortness of breath  sweating  and occasional vomiting.  Given the patient’s age  strong family history of heart disease  lifestyle factors  and concurrent health conditions like uncontrolled hypertension  obesity  and diabetes  there is a high suspicion of coronary artery disease and his symptoms are strongly suggestive of stable angina. Further diagnostic procedures including EKG  stress test  and possibly more invasive procedures like coronary angiography will be carried forward to confirm the diagnosis.  IV. Concluding Remarks  This case underscores the importance of early detection and preventive lifestyle modifications  particularly in patients with significant risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. It also exemplifies the impact of patient education on adherence to medications and follow-ups for managing chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes  which are both important in preventing the progression of coronary artery disease. 
Coronary artery disease,1,72,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile:  Mr. A is a 65-year-old African American male  presently residing in an urban locality in New York City  USA. He has been previously married and currently lives alone. He is a retired veteran and reports a family history of heart disease with his father having suffered from a heart attack at a similar age. Mr. A is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28kg/m2 and reports occasional tobacco usage. He has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension  which he claims to manage with diet  exercise  and medication.    Medical History:  Mr. A was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 45 and hypertension at age 50  both of which are controlled with medication. He has had no prior major surgeries. He mentioned that he has been on a regimen of Metformin for his diabetes  and Lisinopril for his hypertension. His exercise regimen has been non-consistent in the past few years and his diet irregular. He had a thallium stress test performed three years ago  with no abnormal findings. Recently  however  he has experienced episodes of chest tightness in the last six months  predominantly while performing physical activities.   Present Complaints:  Over the past three weeks  Mr. A has noticed an increase in the frequency and duration of chest tightness  occasionally radiating to his left shoulder and arm. He reported that the chest discomfort also occurs with minimal exertion  such as climbing a flight of stairs or walking for short distances. He has also been experiencing shortness of breath  unexplained sweating  and episodes of dizziness. Furthermore  he has faced discomfort during restful periods  particularly at night. Mr. A mentioned that these symptoms often alleviate when he is at rest.  Given Mr. A's age  ethnicity  comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension  lifestyle choices  and concerning symptoms  the differential diagnosis to be considered is primarily coronary artery disease (CAD). These symptoms and risk factors align with the clinical presentation and demographic risk impact  correlating with epidemiological data in current literature on coronary artery disease.  Further diagnostic testing  including an electrocardiogram  stress test  and if indicated  a coronary angiogram would give further insights into his coronary artery status and guide the appropriate intervention strategy.   If confirmed  a multifaceted approach  including lifestyle modifications  weight management  intensive glycemic control  strict lipid management  antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy  and possibly revascularization strategies (Stent or bypass surgery) will be contemplated to prevent morbidity and mortality from CAD.
Coronary artery disease,1,73,Title: Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Age: 62 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Former Machine Operator Location: Lives in rural North Dakota  Patient History:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of cigarette smoking (40 years  1 pack/day) and a sedentary lifestyle. He is a former machine operator and has been retired for 2 years. He has a prior medical history of hypertension  which has been controlled with medication (Lisinopril) for the past 10 years. His father passed away at 55 due to myocardial infarction  suggesting a family history of heart disease. He typically drinks alcohol occasionally and has a diet that is high in saturated fat and low in fruits and vegetables.   He presents today with a new complaint of intermittent chest pain  described as tightness or pressure in the chest  especially during physical exertion. He reports episodes of fatigue  dyspnea  mild nausea  and episodes of lightheadedness associated with the chest pain.   He denies any recent significant weight loss  fever  or cough. He has no history of diabetes  stroke  autoimmune diseases  or any other major health conditions.   Current Medication: Lisinopril 10mg/day for hypertension  In summary  this is a classic presentation of an elderly Caucasian male from a rural area with several primary risk factors for CAD including advanced age  male sex  hypertension  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  history of consuming a diet high in saturated fat  and family history of CAD. His current symptoms suggest angina pectoris which correlates with the onset and progression of CAD. It emphasizes the need for immediate diagnostic workup and intervention to prevent possible adverse outcomes.  References: 1. Yeh RW  Sidney S  Chandra M  Sorel M  Selby JV  Go AS.

Coronary artery disease,1,74,Title: Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a Caucasian male aged 65 years  presents with concerns related to cardiac health. He currently resides in upstate New York and is retired  having spent the majority of his career in construction. He is a widower and lives alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has had a medical history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension for the last 15 years and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 6 years ago. His medication regimen includes a beta-blocker  a statin  and an oral hypoglycemic agent. Unfortunately  he admits to inconsistent medication adherence due to forgetfulness.   His father passed away at 70 due to a myocardial infarction and his mother at 80 due to stroke. Mr. Doe reports he quit smoking 10 years ago  having smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His lifestyle includes limited physical activity and a diet rich in saturated fats.   Presentation: The presenting complaints include recurrent episodes of chest discomfort  shortness of breath  and noticeable fatigue during bouts of physical exertion over the past three months. The chest discomfort typically improves with rest. Additionally  he also mentions occasional dizziness and episodes of sweatiness.  Conclusion: Combining his symptomatology  demographics  medical history  familial predispositions  and lifestyle factors  the patient appears to be showcasing signs suggestive of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Further diagnostic procedures like an electrocardiogram  stress test  and potentially a coronary angiogram would be beneficial to confirm the diagnosis and guide effective treatment strategies.  This presentation represents a typical patient profile for CAD  considering Mr. Doe is a Caucasian male over the age of 65  possessing a significant risk due to his personal and familial medical history  smoking history  poor diet  and limited physical activity. Early diagnosis and management are necessary to potentially reverse some of the disease progression and improve prognosis.
Coronary artery disease,1,75,Title: A Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who belongs to a middle-class family. He is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He is originally from the Midwest region of the United States.  Presenting Complaint: The patient came with a complaint of recurrent episodes of chest discomfort mainly after physical exertion  which tends to disappear after taking rest. He has been experiencing these complaints for the past six months but they have been gradually increasing in severity over the past month. The discomfort is a heavy 'pressure' sensation situated centrally in his chest.  Medical History: He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with these conditions about 10 years ago and has been on medication (Losartan 50mg once daily and Atorvastatin 20mg once daily) with not always regular follow-ups.   Social History: The patient has a 45 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally  mostly on social gatherings. His diet is moderate in fats and cholesterol  and his level of physical activity is low due to an inactive lifestyle since retirement.  Family History: He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases -- his father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 67 and his older brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in his early 60s. There's no history of diabetes in his family.  Discussion: Given the patient’s middle to old age  male sex  personal history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  family history of CAD and presenting complaint  he falls into a high-risk category for coronary artery disease according to American Heart Association (AHA) risk stratification. Therefore  it is imperative to initiate aggressive management in a timely fashion to prevent severe complications like myocardial infarction or heart failure.  The following tests may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease: physical exam  electrocardiogram (ECG)  blood tests  stress tests  echocardiogram  coronary angiography  and cardiac CT scan. The patient’s therapy could potentially be adjusted based on the findings from these tests. Management will also include lifestyle modifications and close monitoring of his cardiovascular risk factors.
Coronary artery disease,1,76,"Title: Patient Presentation - Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)   Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who is presenting with symptoms consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD).   Demographic Background: Mr. Smith is originally from Texas  married  and has two grown children. Prior to retirement  he worked in operations in a chemicals company  a job that involved high-stress decision-making. He lives in a suburban area with his wife and leads a quite sedentary lifestyle.   Presenting Concerns:  Mr. Smith reports experiencing chest pain  particularly during physical activity  which subsides when he rests. He describes the pain as """"crushing"""" and it sometimes radiates to his left arm. He also reports shortness of breath and occasional bouts of fatigue.   Medical History:  John was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol five years ago and takes medications for both conditions. He has been a smoker for 40 years  with an approximate pack a day habit  although he quit smoking two years ago. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 60.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  Mr. Smith’s Blood Pressure was 145/90 mmHg  heart rate was 80 beats per minute and BMI was 30  falling in the ‘obese’ category. He had normal heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops.   Given Mr. Smith's age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  family history  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and typical chest pain - he is at a high risk for coronary artery disease. He will undergo further diagnostic testing such as EKG  echocardiogram  and possibly coronary angiography for a definitive diagnosis  followed by appropriate management.  Prevention Strategy: In the interim  Mr. Smith is advised to exercise regularly  and maintain a healthy diet which is low in saturated fats  cholesterol  and sodium. His medications for hypertension and cholesterol would need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted.  Conclusion:  Coronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Mr. Smith’s case reflects a typical presentation of CAD in older  Caucasian males. His prevailing risk factors and lifestyle behaviors emphasize the need for behavioral modifications along with suitable medical intervention to manage the disease."
Coronary artery disease,1,77,Title: Patient Presentation - Coronary Artery Disease  I. Patient Profile  The patient  Mr. James Thompson  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  born and residing in Los Angeles  California. He is married and has two adult children. He is a retired lawyer and lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He has a history of smoking for about 40 years  although he quit ten years ago. He considers himself fairly sedentary but tries to maintain a balanced diet  albeit with a high fat intake.  II. Past and Current Medical History  A few years ago  Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with Hypertension (high blood pressure) and Type 2 Diabetes  which are both medically managed. He checks his blood sugar levels daily  and they have been consistently around 180 mg/dL. His hypertension is also monitored  with readings typically around 145/90 mmHg. He has a BMI of 26  putting him in the overweight category.  He has been experiencing intermittent chest pain that increases with exertion over the past few months. His primary care physician referred him to a cardiologist due to increasing concern for angina. Further investigations  including an exercise stress test  were suggestive of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   III. Family History  Mr. Thompson's father passed away after a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his mother has a history of stroke. His older brother was also diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease at an early age.  IV. Social & Personal History  James quit smoking about 10 years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol consumption  usually drinking 2-3 glasses of red wine per week. He admits that his diet could use some improvements  as he tends to indulge in fatty meals a bit too often. His job was fairly stressful  which could likely have contributed to his existing comorbid conditions  but he has been retired for the past five years. He does not partake regularly in any form of physical workout  instead preferring a more sedentary lifestyle.   V. Conclusion  Given Mr. Thompson's demographic profile  past medical  personal and family histories  and his current presentation  it is clear that he possesses multiple risk factors for the development and progression of Coronary Artery Disease. His case aligns with the dominant literature  which suggests that gender  age  race  lifestyle habits  comorbid conditions  and heredity play significant roles in CAD risk.

He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history but reports cessation of smoking over 10 years ago.  Past Medical History: He has a complex past medical history which includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both diagnosed about 7 years ago and being managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. Despite ongoing management  he has intermittent control of these conditions. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago  which is managed with Metformin. His BMI falls into the obese category (30.5) and he has a sedentary lifestyle. He acknowledges a family history of early coronary disease in his father who died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.  Current Presentation: The patient reports a 6-month history of chest pain that is typically exertional  substernal in location  with radiation to the left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and relieved with rest. Recently he has noticed increasing frequency and intensity of the symptoms  now occurring with lighter activities than before which is concerning for increasing severity of coronary artery disease.  Conclusion: In summary  this is a 64-year-old male with risk factors including age  male gender  Caucasian race  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  family history of early CAD  and past smoking history presenting with symptoms highly suggestive of worsening coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis. The patient’s representation  his demographic data  and medical history are consistent with the literature suggesting the leading risk factors for coronary artery disease: age  gender  race  high blood pressure  high cholesterol  diabetes  obesity  physical inactivity  smoking  and family history.
Coronary artery disease,1,79,"Title: Case Presentation of a Patient Presenting with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 62-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. Antonio Fernandez. His height is recorded at 5'10""""  and he weighs 229 pounds  putting him in the obese category. He is a retired construction worker and currently lives with his wife in an urban area. Mr. Fernandez is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago. However  he still consumes alcohol occasionally and follows a diet high in saturated fats.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Fernandez has a significantly extensive history of medical conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) for which he has been on medication for 15 years. He is also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents for the past six years. His lipid profiles have been unremarkable  although occasional increments were evident in the latest reports. He has been receiving treatment for hypercholesterolemia with statin medications for eight years.   There is a family history of heart diseases  as Mr. Fernandez's father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. Besides these conditions  Mr. Fernandez is on mediation for mild osteoarthritis in his knees.  Recently  Mr. Fernandez has been reporting symptoms of angina - characterized by severe chest pain  shortness of breath  fatigue  and frequent sweating. These symptoms led to referral to the Cardiology department to investigate the possibility of Coronary Artery Disease.  The demographic information aligns with several characteristics of a typical patient with Coronary Artery Disease as represented in literature. Many risk factors are present  including advanced age  male sex  hypertensive and diabetic background  obesity  his consumption of a high fat diet  and a family history of heart disease. It is important to note that the Hispanic population is showing an increasing prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease due to factors like diabetes and obesity.   Transient shortness of breath and chest discomfort are prominent symptoms relating to Coronary Artery Disease which corresponds to the complaints of the patient  thereby necessitating further investigations."
Coronary artery disease,1,80,"Presentation Title: Case Profile: Coronary Artery Disease in an Elderly Hispanic Female   Patient Background: The patient is a 72-year-old Hispanic female  Maria Lopez  currently residing in Los Angeles  California. She is a retired schoolteacher  a widow with three adult children  and lives independently. She is non-smoker but has history of mild alcohol consumption. She presents today primarily with episodes of chest pain that she describes as """"an uncomfortable pressure.""""   Demographics and Risk Factors: It is important to note that despite the common stereotype that Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) primarily affects men  approximately one in three women are diagnosed with heart disease annually. The prevalence of CAD among Hispanic women is noteworthy  with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealing that around 17.9% of Hispanic women aged 55-64 years have CAD. Additionally  genetic predisposition  poor dietary patterns  inadequate physical activity  and higher levels of stress are additional risk factors prevalent in this demographic.   Medical History: Ms. Lopez suffers from Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension  both managed for around 15 years with medication. Past records indicate good compliance to medication and lifestyle recommendations. She has a BMI of 29.8  falling into the overweight range  with her last lipid profile revealing elevated LDL and total cholesterol. Sadly  Ms. Lopez lost her husband 8 years ago to a stroke  which has been a major life stressor.   Recent Symptoms: Recently  Ms. Lopez has been experiencing chest pain  particularly during physical exertion. She denied any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath  nausea  or dizziness. She has also noted these episodes after experiencing emotional stress.  This clinical presentation  considering her demographic factors and existing comorbidities  strongly suggests the possibility of Coronary Artery Disease. Further investigations including ECG  stress testing  cardiac catheterization and/or imaging will be required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent and severity of her CAD."
Coronary artery disease,1,81,Title: Patient Presentation: John Smith with Coronary Artery Disease  Demographics: Patient Name: John Smith Gender: Male Age: 66 Years Old Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Construction Worker Residence: San Francisco  California  Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith came into the hospital complaining of chest discomfort during physical activity  which is relieved by rest. He has expressed feeling 'pressure' or 'heaviness' in his chest  along with shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional episodes of lightheadedness.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Metoprolol) and type 2 diabetes managed by diet  Metformin  and insulin. He underwent surgery for a hernia repair 15 years ago  followed by a successful recovery.  Family History: His father died at the age of 72 due to myocardial infarction and had a history of coronary artery disease. His mother had hypertension and died at 78 years old due to stroke.  Lifestyle: Mr. Smith was a smoker for 40 years (2 packs/day) but quit 5 years ago. His diet is high in saturated fats and sodium. He drinks alcohol occasionally and leads a sedentary lifestyle  with limited physical activity.   Observation & Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Smith's BMI was noted to be 30.4  reflecting obesity. His blood pressure readings have been consistently high  indicative of uncontrolled hypertension. No palpable abnormalities in the abdominal region were found.  Conclusion: Given the family history of cardiovascular disease  combined with Mr. Smith's personal medical history and lifestyle factors  he falls into the high-risk category for coronary artery disease. His symptoms of chest discomfort alleviated by rest are indicative of angina pectoris  a common manifestation of coronary artery disease. Further investigations – including an ECG  stress test  and blood tests estimating lipid profile – are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and discuss management options.   In addition to pharmacological management  lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  dietary changes (low salt  low saturated fats)  and optimal control of hypertension and diabetes are crucial in managing Mr. Smith's condition effectively and reducing the risk of complications. Mr. Smith will be referred to a cardiologist for specialised assessment and management.

Mr. Wilson reports intermittent compliance with his medications  and his blood pressure measurements and blood glucose levels have been poorly controlled. There is a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) as his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.  Given the chest pain symptoms  the long history of smoking  poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes  sedentary lifestyle  high-fat diet  and family history of CAD  Mr. Wilson represents a typical patient at high risk for coronary artery disease.  In light of his past medical history  current lifestyle  and symptomatology  it is crucial to initiate a detailed diagnostic work-up for coronary artery disease in Mr. Wilson. The appropriate diagnostic pathway may include an electrocardiogram  stress test  and possibly coronary angiography pending the results. Early detection and management of coronary artery disease could greatly reduce the risk of severe cardiovascular complications  such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) or even death. 
Coronary artery disease,1,83,Title: Coronary Artery Disease: A Patient Case Presentation  I. Introduction: Today  we discuss the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). His name has been withheld due to confidentiality laws. He presents usual risk factors and provides an opportunity for assessing the typical trajectory of CAD.  II. Demographics: The patient is an unmarried  retired school teacher originating from Rochester  New York. He is a non-Hispanic Caucasian of mid socioeconomic status.  III. Past Medical History: Aside from occasionally experiencing minor  non-specific chest discomfort over the past few months  the patient has had no major pressing health issues until now. His past medical history includes treated hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type II diabetes. He has not undergone any previous surgeries  and his family history reveals his mother had early-onset CAD  dying from myocardial infarction at 52.  IV. Lifestyle: The patient lives alone and has a daughter who stays overseas. He has been a smoker for approximately 15 years  averaging about a pack per day. He reported quiescent alcohol intake  drinking only socially and moderately. He reported marginal physical activity; a daily routine that includes walking his dog.  V. Medication: The patient has been on medications for blood pressure (lisinopril)  cholesterol (atorvastatin)  and type II diabetes (metformin). He has no known drug allergies.  VI. Summary:  In conclusion  this patient being an older  Caucasian  moderately active  diabetic male smoker with a history of controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia  a family history of CAD  and current symptoms of chest discomfort  represents the common demographics and risk factors of patients with CAD  as seen in most epidemiological studies.  The next steps of his healthcare management would involve a thorough clinical evaluation  including functional testing and imaging to evaluate and possibly quantify the extent of coronary artery disease  followed by individualized management plans to alleviate symptoms  halt disease progression  and decrease probability of potentially life-threatening events.
Coronary artery disease,1,84,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: The patient  Mr. Martinez  is a 66-year-old Hispanic male who lives with his wife in San Antonio  Texas. They have three adult children.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Martinez visited the clinic  complaining of persistent chest pain for the past two weeks  typically experienced during physical exertion such as walking uphill or carrying groceries. He described the pain as a heavy pressure  similar to """"an elephant sitting on my chest."""" In addition  he also reported shortness of breath  fatigue  and some episodes of lightheadedness.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years and quit ten years ago. His dietary habits  which he admits could be healthier  lean towards traditional Hispanic cuisine high in sodium and fat. He consumes alcohol occasionally  usually in social gatherings.   Familial Medical History: There is a strong familial history of heart disease. Both his mother and father were diagnosed with coronary artery disease in their 60s. His younger brother had a stroke three years ago at the age of 62.  Social History: Mr. Martinez is a retired construction worker. He and his wife enjoy traveling in their RV  spending time with their grandchildren  and attending their local church activities. Mr. Martinez admits he has been less physically active since he retired three years ago.  Discussion: Mr. Martinez's age  sex  ethnicity  sedentary lifestyle  and family medical history all place him in a higher-risk demographic for coronary artery disease. Particularly  according to CDC  Hispanic men are significantly affected by coronary artery disease. The presence of co-existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes  in addition to his long history of smoking  could also contribute to his condition.   Prompt diagnosis and management will be critical for Mr. Martinez to reduce future risk and potential cardiac events. Managing his coronary artery disease will involve a multi-pronged approach that includes pharmaceutical intervention  lifestyle modifications  and possibly surgical interventions."
Coronary artery disease,1,85,Title: Case Presentation: A Hispanic Female Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  I. Patient Demographics The patient known as Rosa Gonzales is a 64-year-old Hispanic female  born and raised in El Paso  Texas. She is a first-generation US citizen  having had grandparents who emigrated from Mexico. Ms. Gonzales is a mother of three and grandmother of two  cohabitating with her youngest daughter and grandchildren. She identifies as a Catholic and retired as a middle school Spanish teacher after 35 years of service.   II. Chief Complaint Ms. Gonzales primarily presents with discomfort in her chest  often described as a sensation of pressure  especially during exertion. She also reports experiencing breathlessness on exertion and occasional bouts of heart palpitations. The discomfort is relieved with rest.  III. Relevant Medical History Ms. Gonzales has a significant past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which was diagnosed about 15 years ago. This illness is generally under control with Metformin and a practical low-sugar diet. She has also been suffering from hypertension for the last 20 years  managed with a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril. She battled obesity in her early adult years but has maintained a healthy weight for the past decade due to a balanced diet and regular exercise. Unfortunately  she has a genetic predisposition to CAD which is evident from her previous cardiac history where her father died of a heart attack at the age of 62  and her elder brother was diagnosed with CAD at 58.  IV. Lifestyle and Socio-Economic Factors She retired three years ago  which has brought noticeable changes in her lifestyle  leading to less physical activity. She admits to being a non-smoker and occasionally indulges in alcohol during family celebrations. Economic factors do not appear to limit Ms. Gonzales access to healthcare services  as she has health insurance through the teachers' pension plan and Medicare.  V. Conclusion Based on demographic trends in the literature  the incidence of CAD has been rising  particularly among the Hispanic population  making Ms. Gonzales's case representative of this trend. Factors contributing to her condition include her Hispanic descent  her gender  her age  her genetic predisposition  and associated comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. It is also noteworthy to mention that while she has some protective factors such as no history of smoking  her post-retirement sedentary lifestyle might have exacerbated her risk. It is critical to continually manage her existing conditions and encourage a more active lifestyle to prevent the progression of CAD.  Thank you  any questions?
Coronary artery disease,1,86,Title: Case Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease in a 64-year-old African American Female  I. Introduction We present today a 64-year-old African American female patient  Mrs. A.B.  who resides in an urban area. She is a retired teacher  married with three grown-up children. Research literature suggests that coronary artery disease (CAD) disproportionately affects African Americans  with an increased prevalence in elderly women compared to men.   II. Presenting Symptoms Mrs. A.B arrived at our facility complaining of persistent chest discomfort  shortness of breath  and occasional dizziness. The chest discomfort is often precipitated by physical activity or emotional stress but lately has been occurring spontaneously. These symptoms have limited her daily activities and exerted emotional distress on the patient  prompting her to seek medical attention.  III. Past Medical History  Mrs. A.B has a notable past medical history for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both currently managed with medications. She reports having been a smoker for about 20 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. She also admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet regularly containing high calories and fats. Her family history is significant for her father  who suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 years.   IV. Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  Mrs. A.B was found to have a BP reading of 140/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 80 beats per minute  and a body mass index (BMI) of 30.2 kg/m2  indicating obesity. A preliminary electrocardiogram (ECG) showed some abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia.   V. Conclusion Given Mrs. A.B's demographic information  presenting symptoms  and clinical findings  she demonstrates several risk factors for CAD  including her age  race  gender  hypertensive and diabetic status  history of smoking  obesity  and high-fat diet. A definitive diagnosis will be confirmed through further cardiac investigations such as a coronary angiogram. If diagnosis is affirmed  a combination of lifestyle modifications and targeted pharmacotherapy will be essential components of her management strategy.  This case illustrates the high-risk demographic for CAD and underscores the importance of early screening and preventive interventions for individuals within this demographic categorization. Initiating discussions about healthy lifestyle modifications during routine visits could significantly decrease morbidity and mortality related to CAD.
Coronary artery disease,1,87,Title: Patient Presentation for Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Demographics  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. John Allen  who resides in urban Southern California. He is a retired mechanical engineer and is married with two adult children. His primary language is English  and he is insured through Medicare. Mr. Allen has a BMI of 27  indicating he is slightly overweight. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but reports a 20 pack-year history. Mr. Allen has a history of moderate alcohol use but stopped drinking five years ago.   Past Medical History  Mr. Allen has been diagnosed with several chronic conditions over the past decade. He has type 2 diabetes which is managed with Metformin  a history of hypertension controlled with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 67. His mother  who lived to 89  was diagnosed with stroke in her late 70s.   Presenting Symptoms   Mr. Allen presents with a six-month history of progressive chest pain  especially during physical activity  like walking and gardening. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in his chest which sometimes radiates to his left arm. He also reports shortness of breath and occasional episodes of dizziness. His wife has also noted an increase in his fatigue level  and he has been waking up at night due to shortness of breath more frequently over the last few months.   In Conclusion  Considering his demographic profile and presenting symptoms  Mr. Allen represents a typical case of a patient at risk for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). His age  sex  past smoking history  presence of comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension  as well as family history of heart disease  puts him at a high risk of CAD. His symptoms of chest pain  radiating to the left arm  fatigue  and shortness of breath are classic signs of angina pectoris  often associated with CAD.
Coronary artery disease,1,88,Title: Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease in a Typical Patient  Introduction: Discussing today is a typical patient representing the most common demographic affected by coronary artery disease (CAD). This will highlight the potential risk factors  common symptoms  and necessary interventions related to CAD.  Demographic Information: The patient  Mr. Smith  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male of Irish descent. This demographic profile aligns with current literature indicating that CAD is most prevalent among Caucasian men above 65 years. Mr. Smith is retired  prefers a sedentary lifestyle  and has a 40-year pack history of tobacco use.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a past medical history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. He is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.5 and has a familial history of heart disease. His diet has been high in saturated fats and cholesterol  while low in fruits and vegetables. He has been irregular with his antihypertensive medication due to his nonchalance towards his health conditions.  Presentation: Mr. Smith presents to the hospital with complaints of typical angina pain which he describes as a pressure-like sensation in his mid-chest  radiating to his neck  jaw  and left arm. The duration of these episodes has experienced an increase in the past month  provoking with lesser exertion and increasingly occurring at rest.   This symptomatic representation  together with Mr. Smith's demographic profile and past medical history  points strongly towards CAD as the primary suspect.  As we navigate this case further  our main focuses will be on risk factor modification  lifestyle changes  initiation of optimal medical therapy  and assessing the need for invasive procedures to improve Mr. Smith's health condition and prognosis.   Closing: Through Mr. Smith's case  it becomes evident that CAD is a disease that stems from the confluence of multiple lifestyle factors and underlying medical conditions. With properly structured interventions  Mr. Smith's quality of life can be significantly improved  and the progression of his CAD can be efficiently managed.

He's lived a sedentary lifestyle  is a pensioner  and has been a heavy smoker for most of his life. James is widowed  lives alone  and his children live in various parts of the country  only visiting during the holidays. As per literature  CAD is commonly observed among males  specifically those of Caucasian ethnicity  and is more common as age advances.  III. Present Medical Condition:  James arrived at the hospital complaining of persistent chest pain (angina) that has been occurring over the last few months. He noticed the pain is more pronounced when exerting himself or under stress. Recently  he has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath.  IV. Past Medical History:  James has a known history of elevated cholesterol levels and Type 2 diabetes  both inadequately controlled. He's been prescribed statins and metformin in the past  but admits irregular use of these medications. He's made occasional attempts to quit smoking but has been largely unsuccessful. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug use.   V. Family History:  James's father died from myocardial infarction at age 65  his mother has a history of hypertension  and his elder brother had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at 59.   VI. Preliminary Diagnosis:  Based on the age  gender  smoking history  poor glycemic control  elevated lipid levels  family history  and presenting symptoms  Mr. James is likely to have coronary artery disease.  VII. Further Investigations:  An ECG  cardiac enzymes & biomarkers  Lipid profile  Echocardiography  Treadmill stress test  and Coronary angiography are recommended for further confirmation and management.   VIII. Conclusion:  High index of suspicion for CAD is warranted in this case due to several red flags  including striking risk factors  symptomatology  and relevant past and family history. Early diagnosis may lead to better patient outcomes through timely medical or surgical intervention and comprehensive lifestyle modifications.

Introduction:  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  is a retired financial consultant who currently resides with his wife of 40 years in Denver  Colorado. He has been referred to our cardiology department due to symptoms suggestive of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   2. Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a long-standing history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  managed for the last decade with medication (Lisinopril 10mg/daily and Atorvastatin 20mg/daily  respectively). He has Type 2 diabetes  controlled via metformin. Historically  he was a smoker for over 30 years but quit 12 years ago. He admits to having a sedentary lifestyle and mostly consumes a diet high in fat. Doe's family history is significant for CAD  with his father dying from a myocardial infarction at age 70.  3. Presenting Symptoms:  In the last three months  Mr. Doe has experienced intermittent chest discomfort  particularly while climbing stairs. He described the pain as a heaviness in his chest  radiating to his left arm. His wife has noted his pallor during these episodes. They last 10-15 minutes and resolve with rest.  Critically  the frequency and intensity of the discomfort have increased over the last 2 weeks. During his last episode  he grew dizzy and felt shortness of breath  prompting his visit.  4. Conclusion:  Given his age  gender  past medical history  and symptoms  Mr. Doe is at a high risk for CAD. It's vital he undergoes tests including an EKG  stress test  and possibly coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of disease. Considering his lifestyle and diet history  it is also necessary to commence a discussion on lifestyle modification and diet control to manage and slow the progression of CAD.  Of note  CAD is the most common type of heart disease and leading cause of death in the US  affecting more than 18.2 million adults over 20. Especially  men are at elevated risk after the age of 45  and women after 55  like in this case representing an average patient population with CAD.
Coronary artery disease,1,96,Title: Coronary Artery Disease - Case Presentation   Patient Information -  Mr. John Smith  a 62-year-old African American male  presents to the clinic reporting acute chest pain and difficulty in breathing. The patient is married and works as an accountant. Currently  he resides in Houston  Texas with his wife and two children. Mr. Smith is also an active smoker  smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years  and admits to consuming alcohol on the weekends. He does not exercise regularly claiming a busy work schedule as the primary reason for physical inactivity.  Medical History -  Mr. Smith has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with medication and diet changes. His last check was six months ago  and he has been inconsistent in maintaining his appointments owing to his work demands. There are no known drug allergies.  Family History -  On exploration of family history  it was recorded that his father succceeded in his battle against prostate cancer but died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. Also  his mother has a history of chronic heart disease. His older brother  currently 64 years old  has been diagnosed recently with coronary artery disease.   Current Presentation -  Mr. Smith reports pain in his chest radiating to his left shoulder along with shortness of breath. These symptoms occur frequently during exercise or stressful situations  but this time they woke him from sleep and have lasted longer than usual. He rated the severity of the chest pain as 7/10. His blood pressure readings were high today. The initial EKG reflected ST changes indicative of coronary ischemia.  Conclusion -  Considering his age  gender  race  active smoking habit  history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  strong family history of heart disease  and symptoms  Mr. Smith is at high risk of coronary artery disease. The provisional diagnosis  based on his symptoms  is Unstable Angina. Further testing  such as a stress test or angiogram  is warranted to confirm the diagnosis  assess the severity of the disease  and plan for appropriate intervention.  Many current studies highlight the higher prevalence of coronary artery disease among African American men over the age of 60  with multiple risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and family history  which is consistent with Mr. Smith's case. Appropriate intervention and lifestyle modification can help manage his condition.
Coronary artery disease,1,97,**Title:** Presentation of a patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  **Demographics:**  The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  married with two grown children. He carries ethnicity relevant risk factors as CAD is more prevalent in Caucasian men over 60 years of age. He lives in an urban area in New Jersey  USA and is a retired engineer. His socioeconomic status is within the mid-to-upper level.  **Past Medical History:**  Mr. Johnson has a known history of hypertension controlled with an ACE inhibitor and hyperlipidemia managed on statin therapy  which are known risk factors for coronary artery disease. He is an ex-smoker and quit smoking 4 years back after a 30 years smoking habit. He does moderate exercise but is on an unhealthy diet  especially high in salt and processed/trans-fats.   Family history is positive for his father who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and his mother with diabetes. Mr. Johnson himself was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus three years ago which is also significant as it is a major risk factor for CAD. He checks glucose level frequently and maintains a good glycemic control.  He recovered from a mild stroke 2 years ago with minimum residual deficits and had been diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) 5 years ago. Both conditions share a common pathophysiology with CAD  enhancing the risk.  He does not consume alcohol excessively and denies any recreational drug use. There are no known allergies to any drug.   **Presentation:**  Mr. Johnson has been complaining of recurrent episodes of chest pain  often radiating to his left arm and jaw which worsens with exertion and relieves on rest over the past six months. It is mostly associated with dyspnea. Critical review of his symptoms indicates a probable diagnosis of angina pectoris due to CAD.  **Summary:**  Mr. Johnson’s risk factors for CAD include age  male sex  Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  past smoking history  unhealthy diet  DM-2  family history  stroke  PAD  and sedentary lifestyle. These have contributed to his current presentation with angina pectoris  indicating the need for further evaluation and management.  **References:** Benjamin EJ  Muntner P  Bittencourt MS.

Coronary artery disease,1,99,Title: Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe is a 64-year-old African American male who currently resides in a suburban neighborhood in Chicago  Illinois. He is  apparently retired from a career in law enforcement and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker  but admits to moderately consuming alcohol during his leisure time. He has a family history of heart disease - his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72.  Existing Medical History:  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus five years ago. He follows treatment regimen mainly consisting of antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemic agents as prescribed by his primary care physician. His blood pressure and sugar levels are fairly under control  largely due to both the medication and dietary adjustments. He has been overweight most of his adult life  with a current BMI of 28.4 kg/m2. He suffered from a minor stroke a year ago from which he has made satisfactory recovery.  Presenting Complaint:  He is presenting with complaints of non-specific chest discomfort  particularly during physical exertion  which has been ongoing for the past 2 months. He describes the pain as dull and pressing in nature  often radiating towards his left arm; relieved upon rest. He also reports episodes of shortness of breath  fatigue and occasional dizziness. His symptoms are suggestive of stable angina.  Summarized History:  Upon reviewing his exposure history  he has no recent out-of-state travel or contact with sick individuals. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity and a diet that frequently includes high fat foods.  These symptoms  coupled with his medical history and lifestyle  indicate a strong possibility of coronary artery disease. Further diagnostic tests like ECG  stress test  echocardiogram and possibly angiogram would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.   Discussion:  Mr. Doe's advanced age  gender  and African American ethnicity may influence his risk for coronary artery disease. His presence of comorbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and overweight condition further increase his risk. Other additive factors affecting his CAD likely include his dietary behavior  lack of exercise  moderate alcohol consumption  and family genetics.   Healthcare Plan:  Once a definitive diagnosis has been established  a comprehensive approach to management including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions needs to be implemented. A dedicated team of healthcare professionals would carry out the management plan to improve Mr. Doe's cardiovascular health. This would include initiating therapies like antiplatelet medication  betablockers  ACE inhibitors and statins among others. A comprehensive lifestyle modification strategy including a balanced diet  regular exercise  and weight management needs to be instituted  and Mr. Doe needs to be educated on the importance of adhering to such a regimen. Regular follow-ups for monitoring his condition would be suggested.
Coronary artery disease,1,100,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. James Peterson Age: 68 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupational History: Retired Accountant Living Conditions: Lives alone in an urban area  Clinical history: Mr. Peterson has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been managing these conditions with medication for the past 10 years and is relatively compliant with his treatment regimen. However  he has a history of smoking for 40 years  although he quit 10 years ago. He has experienced mild obesity throughout his life  but he has made recent efforts to maintain a stable weight through diet and exercise. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  indicating a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Peterson visited the clinic complaining of recurring chest pain for the last two weeks. The pain often comes when he is engaging in physical activity but also happens when he is resting. He described the pain as a sensation of pressure and fullness in the center of his chest which occasionally radiates to his left arm. The episodes are intermittent  lasting 1-2 minutes  and usually relieved by rest or nitroglycerin treatment which he was prescribed.  Additional Sypmtoms: Mr. Peterson also reported experiencing shortness of breath  fatigue  and feelings of light-headedness during these episodes.  Conclusion: Given Mr. Peterson’s age  sex  lifestyle  and family history of cardiovascular disease  in combination with his clinical symptoms  he is at a high risk for developing coronary artery disease. A more detailed evaluation and tests including ECG  blood tests  and possibly an exercise stress test or angiography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Also  a lifestyle modification that includes a low-fat diet  regular exercise  weight management  and continuous monitoring of his blood pressure and cholesterol levels is strongly suggested. Regular follow-ups are also recommended to keep track of his condition.
Coronary artery disease,2,1,Patient Presentation:  Mr. David Thompson  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the medical clinic with complaints of chest discomfort  particularly on exertion  which has been increasingly getting worse over the past two months. He describes the chest discomfort as a pressing sensation behind his breastbone  occasionally radiating to his left arm. The discomfort is frequently relieved after rest or use of his prescribed Nitroglycerin spray.   Mr. Thompson has a past medical history significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  all of which have been managed with medication but with suboptimal control. He reports a 40 pack-year history of smoking  although he quit around 8 years ago. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 65  and his older brother underwent a coronary bypass surgery at age 58.   On examination  his blood pressure noted to be 140/90 mmHg and pulse 80 bpm. His body mass index is 30 kg/m²  indicating obesity. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression on precordial leads during a bout of chest pain  which resolved after the pain subsided.  These symptoms and findings suggest the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Given his significant cardiovascular risk factors  including age  male sex  hypertension  dyslipidemia  diabetes  obesity  a significant smoking history  and a family history of premature CAD  Mr. Thompson is at high risk for progression of his disease and further cardiovascular events. His risk level and the consequences of CAD progression necessitate aggressive risk factor management  potentially including the consideration of revascularization options.
Coronary artery disease,2,2,Patient Presentation:  A 57-year-old African American male presents to the clinic with recent episodes of chest discomfort while exerting himself in daily activities. He describes the pain as a tightness in his chest  which seems to dissipate with rest. He also has experienced associated symptoms of shortness of breath and unusual fatigue. Occasionally  he has noticed a similar discomfort radiating to his left arm. Over the past week  these episodes seem to have become more frequent and severe.  He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he has managed with diet  exercise  and oral metformin. He has a 25-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago.  He lives alone and is retired  previously working in construction. He denies any alcohol or illicit substance use. He has a family history significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father experiencing a heart attack at 65 years old. The patient's BMI falls within the overweight range  and he admits to a diet high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables.  On physical examination  he is mildly hypertensive with a blood pressure of 142/90  pulse regular  respirations unlabored  and BMI of 28. Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation  and there is no peripheral edema. His glucose is slightly elevated on routine bloodwork. His lipids  specifically his low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  are also high according to bloodwork results. Resting EKG shows non-specific changes.  Based on this patient's age  race  sex  risk factors (hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  former smoker  positive family history) and presenting symptoms  he is at high risk for coronary artery disease and needs immediate further diagnostic evaluation.
Coronary artery disease,2,3,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jose Ramirez is a 58-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He presents today with discomfort in his chest  shortness of breath  and fatigue.

Relevant past medical tests include elevated cholesterol levels and an EKG performed locally two years ago  displaying T wave inversions in lateral leads. Today  an immediate EKG is recommended to assess his current cardiac status given the circumstances."
Coronary artery disease,2,4,Patient Presentation   Mr. Hernandez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presents himself to the outpatient clinic with complaints of angina (chest discomfort)  characterized as a squeezing pain in his chest occurring over the past two months. He reports the pain is mostly triggered by physical activities and emotional stress  to which it subsides after rest or nitroglycerin use. He also mentions experiencing shortness of breath and occasional dizziness. He denies any history of syncope  palpitations  or edema.  Mr. Hernandez has a past medical history notable for hypertension for 15 years  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 years  and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia are regularly controlled with lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively  and his diabetes is managed with metformin. He had a 40-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. He used to work as an electrician but is retired now. His father died at 55 due to a myocardial infarction and his mother died at 85 due to stroke. He follows a typical western diet and admits his physical activities are limited. His BMI last measured was 28.  Given his symptom history  risk profile  and family history  he was suspected to have coronary artery disease (CAD). He was then referred for diagnostic tests including ECG  stress testing  and potentially an angiogram.
Coronary artery disease,2,5,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Joseph Alvarez  a 63-year-old Hispanic male  with a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  presents to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest discomfort over the past 8 weeks. Chest discomfort is described as a pressure-like sensation located in the substernal region  radiating towards the left arm. The pain characteristically begins with physical exertion  like climbing stairs or carrying heavy objects  and is typically relieved at rest within few minutes. Occasionally  Mr. Alvarez also experiences symptoms of shortness of breath  particularly during physical efforts or exertional activities. He is a retired police officer  with a 20-year smoking history but managed to quit 10 years ago. He leads a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity  and his diet is high in saturated fats and sodium.  Family history is significant as his father had a myocardial infarction at age 67  and his mother  who is currently 82  has long-standing hypertension. He denies episodes of dizziness  syncope  or palpitations. He has been adhering to his prescribed medications for diabetes and hypertension  which include Metformin and Lisinopril.  Apart from hypertension and diabetes  his past medical history is unremarkable. He consumes alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use.

Assessment: Based on the symptoms  history  and examination  the patient falls into a high-risk group for coronary artery disease. Immediate diagnostic testing and cardiology consultation would be appropriate."
Coronary artery disease,2,7,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Wilson  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the clinic complaining of persistent chest discomfort for the past 4 weeks. Mr. Wilson is a retired school teacher and lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He reports that this pain typically emerges when he is carrying out activities such as climbing stairs or walking uphill  and is alleviated with rest. He describes the pain as a squeezing sensation located typically in the mid-chest region  often radiating to the left arm; he doesn't identify the pain as being extremely sharp or stabbing in nature.   Further questioning reveals that Mr. Wilson has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Hypertension (HTN) for over a decade  which are currently controlled with medications. He used to smoke a half-pack of cigarettes daily early in his adulthood but quit smoking around 20 years ago. His dietary history reveals a preference for high-fat and high-cholesterol foods. He also admits to maintaining a sedentary lifestyle with little physical activity  although he used to be more active in his younger years.   Mr. Wilson’s father died of a heart attack at the age of 59 and he reports that a few of his male family members have also had cardiac events in their late fifties. On his last visit 3 months ago  his body mass index was recorded as 28.5 and his blood pressure was 145/85 mm Hg. His LDL cholesterol was 145 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol was 35 mg/dL. His HbA1c was 7.5%.   Given the multiple risk factors — advanced age  male gender  African American ethnicity  family history of coronary artery disease (CAD)  personal history of DM and HTN  history of smoking  a high-fat diet and sedentary lifestyle — Mr. Wilson is at a high risk for CAD  which may be responsible for his symptoms.
Coronary artery disease,2,8,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old African American male who presents with a chief complaint of increasing bouts of agina over past three months. He describes a left-sided chest pain that he characterizes as a “heavy feeling ” accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue. The pain is especially severe after moderate exertion such as climbing stairs or after a meal but it also occurred at rest twice in the last week. He reports that his symptoms are relieved with rest in 15-20 minutes.  Mr. Johnson has a past medical history significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications include Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes. He does not take any medication for the chest discomfort. He is a former smoker  having quit 5-6 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 25 years. His mother and father died at ages 70 and 75 respectively  and both had heart diseases.  Social history reveals that he lives with his wife and is a retired mechanic. He admits to poor diet  occasional alcohol use and his exercise regimen is limited due to consistent lower back pain. On physical examination  he appears in moderate distress. His height and weight are 5'8"""" and 190 pounds respectively. His BMI is 28.9 kg/m2 indicating he is overweight. His blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg  heart rate of 82 bpm  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.  His diagnostic test including ECG indicated T-wave inversion and 2D Echo revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory results showed elevated LDL and HbA1c levels confirming poor diabetes control. These findings along with his clinical presentation  risk factors such as hypertension  dyslipidemia  diabetes  a positive family history  and his demographic (African-American male older than 60 years) highly suggest the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. "
Coronary artery disease,2,9,Patient Presentation:  A 63-year-old African-American male presents to the clinic with complaints of chronic chest pain for the last 3 months  with increased severity over the last few days. The pain is described as a heavy pressure sensation centrally located in the chest  radiating to the left arm  and often occurs during physical activity or bouts of extreme stress but subsides at rest.  He reports a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 25 years  but has quit for 7 years. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension managed with lisinopril for the last 5 years and hyperlipidaemia managed with atorvastatin for 3 years. His father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.  His BMI is 31  vital signs are BP 140/90 mmHg  HR 78 bpm  RR 18 per minute  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. No evidence of acute distress noted. On auscultation  cardiac sounds S1 and S2 are appreciable and rhythm regular with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  He currently works as a middle school teacher and lives with his wife. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. His diet history reveals frequent consumption of high-fat foods.  These presenting symptoms  demographic attributes  and lifestyle habits are suggestive of possible stable coronary artery disease with high-risk factors. Further diagnostic workup including EKG and echocardiogram is recommended to rule out other differential diagnoses. The patient is at high risk for a major cardiovascular event due to his age  race  chronic hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of premature coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,2,10,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Juan Garcia  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic complaining of persistent substernal chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw  often experienced during exertion but resolves with rest. The pain is described as a crushing sensation and has been occurring intermittently over the past three months. He has associated symptoms of dyspnea  easy fatiguability  and episodes of diaphoresis.  Mr. Garcia lives with his wife in the city and is a retired construction worker. He has a 30-year history of smoking but claims to have quit ten years ago. His diet is high in red meats and processed foods  with minimal consumption of fruits and vegetables. He lacks consistent physical activity. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.  His past medical history includes uncontrolled type 2 diabetes diagnosed eight years ago and hypertension diagnosed ten years ago.

Upon physical examination  the patient appears diaphoretic. His blood pressure reads 150/95 mmHg  pulse 90/min  oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals no rubs  gallops  or murmurs. Pulmonary examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Given his symptoms  long-standing smoking history  family history of heart disease  and hypertension  there is concern for a presentation consistent with stable angina from possible coronary artery disease. "
Coronary artery disease,2,39,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 62-year-old African American male who came to the clinic reporting escalating chest discomfort over the past three weeks. He described the pain as dull  heavy  and occurring intermittently  located on the left side of his chest  which sometimes radiates to the left arm and accompanied by shortness of breath and episodes of fatigue.  Mr. Smith is a retired postal worker  a smoker with a 40-pack-year history  and has been consuming alcohol moderately for the past 30 years. His dietary history reveals high saturated fat intake and low physical activity  which has led to his current body mass index (BMI) of 31  categorized as obese.  His past medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed five years ago  currently controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. Mr. Smith also suffers from hypertension under treatment with antihypertensive medication for the last eight years. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 59 and his mother has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and hypertension.  He is currently on Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes and Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for hypertension.

He is married with two grown children. He is a smoker and has a 20-pack year history of smoking. He admits to rarely exercising and adheres to a diet high in red meat and processed food.  Past Medical History:   His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  diagnosed five years ago and is currently on medication (Amlodipine for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia). He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having had a myocardial infarction at age 55. He also reports being moderately obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) 30 kg/m2.  Given the patient's age  sex  smoking history  lack of physical activity  unhealthy diet  and family history  he corresponds well to the demographic of a typical patient with coronary artery disease as represented in prevalent clinical study data.
Coronary artery disease,2,63,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Selvam  a 65-year-old Asian-Indian man  presents to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain for the past two months. The patient describes the chest pain as a heavy  squeezing sensation located in the mid-sternal area that radiates to his left arm and lasts about 10 to 15 minutes. The pain was initially induced by heavy physical activity but is now also occurring at rest. Given these symptoms  the patient is experiencing a decreased interest in performing his daily activities  such as gardening  citing shortness of breath and fatigue.  The patient is a retired engineer  married with two adult children  and lives with his wife. He has lived in the United States since he was 30 years-old. He has a 15-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He admits he doesn’t exercise much and follows a typical Indian diet that is rich in fats and carbohydrates.  His medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both conditions were diagnosed eight years ago and are managed with medications: Losartan 50 mg/day for hypertension and metformin 1000 mg twice a day for diabetes. Despite compliance with medications  blood sugar levels and blood pressure have been persistently elevated in recent clinic visits.  Family history is significant for heart disease. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 52 and his elder sister was recently diagnosed with angina.  Article sources have stated that South Asians  particularly Asian Indians  have a higher prevalence of coronary artery diseases. Other risk factors like age  gender  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  poor dietary habits  hypertension  diabetes  and family history present in Mr. Selvam further increase his risk for coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,2,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic with progressive  exertional chest discomfort over the last several months. He describes the pain as a pressure sensation  located in the central chest  which radiates to the left arm. The pain typically lasts for 10-15 minutes and improves with rest. He also reports associated shortness of breath.   Smith reports a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus  for which he currently takes lisinopril and metformin respectively. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history but has quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has a diet high in high-fat  high-sodium foods.  His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his mother was diagnosed with stroke at the age of 68. His elder brother  aged 70  is also diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Smith leads a sedentary lifestyle with minimal daily exercise. He is currently retired and states that he has been feeling a significant amount of stress due to financial concerns which is also leading to occasional insomnia.   He also reports a history of erectile dysfunction for the past couple years.   In summary  Smith is an elderly  African-American male presenting with typical angina  and multiple risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) including older age  male gender  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  familial history of early CAD  unhealthy diet  psychosocial stressors  erectile dysfunction  and physical inactivity.
Coronary artery disease,2,65,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Joe Davis  a 60-year-old African American male patient  presented himself in the clinic today. He is retired and lives with his wife and two adult children with no history of substance abuse. He complains of recurrent chest pain for the past few months  which he describes as a heaviness or pressure in his chest. Mr. Davis mentions the episodes are often triggered by physical exertion and are often relieved by rest. Recently  he has also noticed shortness of breath during these episodes  accompanied by fatigue and occasional dizziness. It's worth noting he also reports having intermittent episodes of heartburn but antacids seem to provide little relief.  His past medical history shows a diagnosis of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the past few years  and Type 2 diabetes that was diagnosed 5 years ago. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia and was prescribed statin therapy but has been inconsistent in taking the medication over the last year. Additionally  he reports a 20 pack year history of smoking  though his last cigarette was approximately a year ago. There's also a relevant family history of Coronary Artery Disease with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  His current medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for cholesterol. No known drug allergies are reported. On general physical exam  he appears slightly overweight with a BMI of 28 and blood pressure reading high at 150/90 mmHg. He denies any illicit drug use and alcohol consumption. The patient conveys concern about his symptoms and is keen to know what could be wrong.  Based on the patient’s presentation and his risk factors including his age  race  medical history of untreated hypertension and high cholesterol  poorly controlled diabetes  previous smoking habits  overweight status  family history  and the fact that his symptoms are relieved by the rest  a differential diagnosis directed towards coronary artery disease (CAD) (Angina Pectoris) might be reasonable.

The pain is described as pressure-like  radiating to his left arm  mostly occurs with physical activity  and is relieved by rest. He also reports associated symptoms such as shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional dizziness.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a known history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus which have been managed by Lisinopril and Metformin  respectively  over the past 5 years. He quit smoking about 10 years ago after a 30 packs/year habit and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He has a history of dyslipidemia and his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. His BMI is calculated at 29  indicating overweight.  On regular follow-ups  he has been documented with relatively poor glycemic control (HbA1c ranging from 7.5 – 8.0) for diabetes and occasional blood pressure spikes above the target range. His most recent lipid profile  6 months ago  showed total cholesterol of 220mg/dL  HDL 35mg/dL  LDL 160mg/dL  and triglycerides 180mg/dL.     The patient has been non-compliant with recommended dietary restrictions and seems to be leading a sedentary lifestyle. He admits no regular exercise habits and his diet frequently contains processed  high-fat content food. He denies illegal drug use and no noted allergy was reported to any medications.    Given the nature of his symptoms along with underlying comorbidities  poor lifestyle measures  and a positive family history  a provisional diagnosis of Chronic Stable Angina (coronary artery disease) is being highly suspected.
Coronary artery disease,2,85,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 62-year-old African American male who presents with a three-week history of intermittent  central chest discomfort radiating down his left arm  often associated with exertion and relieved with rest. These episodes occur approximately three times a week and last approximately 10 minutes each time. He also reports shortness of breath  especially during physical activities and has mentioned numerous instances of sudden  unexpected fatigue. He denies any recent history of cough  fever  weight changes  or night sweats.  The patient has a 20-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which is currently being managed with Metformin  and a 5-year history of Hypertension controlled by Lisinopril. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He has never had a myocardial infarction or stroke  and there is no known family history of premature cardiovascular disease. He has been non-compliant with his daily exercise routine and follows a diet high in saturated fats.  On physical examination  the patient has a BMI of 29.5  blood pressure of 150/90mmHg  heart rate of 78 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  The patient's demographics and presentation strongly suggest stable angina due to coronary artery disease  and hence  warrants further investigations and management. His age  gender  race  and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes mellitus  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and unhealthy diet all contribute to his high risk of coronary artery disease. The characteristic nature of his chest discomfort strongly points towards angina pectoris secondary to coronary ischemia.
Coronary artery disease,2,86,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Thompson is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the clinic with a two-week history of chest pain. He is a retired factory worker who lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He has been experiencing a discomforting pressure in his chest  particularly when exercising  described as a heavy feeling that is sometimes accompanied by a shortness of breath. He states that the pain is relievable by rest.   Mr. Thompson has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which have been managed with medication for the past ten years. He is a former smoker  having quit approximately 15 years ago  but he did smoke a pack a day for approximately 20 years. He admits to having a sedentary lifestyle and a diet that is high in fats and cholesterol.   He had a myocardial infarction ten years ago  at the age of 53  and has been on aspirin and a statin since then. There is a family history of coronary artery disease  with his father having undergone coronary artery bypass surgery at the age of 60.   On examination  his blood pressure is elevated at 145/95mmHg and his BMI is 29 kg/m2  indicative of overweight. His lungs are clear to auscultation  and heart sounds are normal with no murmurs or gallops. He is in no apparent distress at rest.  Laboratory investigations reveal elevated LDL cholesterol and HbA1c. EKG shows ST-segment depression indicative of myocardial ischemia. Given these findings  he is referred to Cardiology for further evaluation for suspected Coronary Artery Disease.
Coronary artery disease,2,87,Patient Presentation:  Gender: Male    Age: 65   Race: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired Construction Worker    Chief Complaint:   Patient complains of a chronic chest pain that worsens upon exertion and improves with rest past 2 months.  History of Present Illness:   The patient reports intermittent chest discomfort described as a pressing sensation behind the sternum  often radiating to the left arm and sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He says that it mostly occurs while walking his dog or during an emotional event but always improves with rest. He denies any symptoms when he is at rest. The patient also reports feelings of unusual fatigue and has noticed a decrease in his exercise capacity.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes 12 years ago  for which he takes metformin and lisinopril daily. He quit smoking 10 years ago but had a 30-year pack history prior. He also has a known history of hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 8 years ago  for which he had been prescribed statins. Patient occasionally takes nitroglycerin for angina as prescribed by the cardiologist.  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at 70 and his elder brother  68  underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 2 years ago due to severe coronary artery disease.  Social History: The patient is a widower who lives alone. He is a retired construction worker. He admits to alcohol consumption of 1-2 drinks per day. He has stopped smoking and does not use illicit drugs.  Review of Systems: Positive for chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue. Negative for fever  cough  weight loss  palpitations  dizziness  and syncope.  On examination:    Vital signs: BP 140/85mmHg  HR: 85 bpm  RR: 18/min  Temp: 98°F   Physical examination is largely unremarkable except for an obese abdominal stature  and bilateral ankle edema.  In conclusion  given the patient's age  sex  symptoms  and past medical and family history  the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is suspected. Further investigation is required for confirmation and potential intervention. 
Coronary artery disease,2,88,Patient Presentation:  A 63-year-old Caucasian male presents to the clinic complaining of recurring episodes of chest pain  typically following physical exertion or emotional stress. He describes it as a crushing pain in the middle of his chest that sometimes spreads to his left arm and jaw. It occasionally coincides with shortness of breath  sweating  and nausea  and generally resolves with rest.   He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes. The patient has a 30 packs/year history of smoking though he quit five years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. Family history is notable for his father who passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  The patient currently takes medications including metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. He admits that he does have a sedentary lifestyle and does not adhere to a diabetes-friendly diet. He is otherwise independent in all activities of daily living and is retired. The patient lives with his wife in a suburban community and his only stress at the moment is related to his recent financial loss.  On initial assessment  his blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg  heart rate is 80 beats per minute  respirations are 18 per minute  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Upon auscultation  his heart sounds appear to be normal and lung fields are clear bilaterally.  Given his age  gender  race  symptoms  and risk factors  a suspicion of coronary artery disease is warranted. A thorough cardiovascular evaluation including 12-lead electrocardiogram and possibly further tests such as coronary angiography are scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and severity of his condition  as well as to guide appropriate management.
Coronary artery disease,2,89,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male who presents with a chief complaint of persistent  crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw. Accompanying symptoms include episodes of shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and fatigue  particularly after moderate physical activity. His symptoms have been progressing over the past several months.  He has a significant history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both managed on medication for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago  for which he takes a statin. He also has a 20-year history of smoking  which he quit about 1 year ago.   He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father and elder brother both suffered myocardial infarctions in their early sixties. He is retired and has a history of poor adherence to a healthy diet and poor exercise habits. He is 5'8” tall  weighs 248 lbs  and has a body mass index of 37.7  putting him in the category of obesity.  The patient denies any allergies to medication. He is currently on the following management: Metformin for his type 2 diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia.  Given the patient's history  symptoms  and risk factors  there is a high suspicion for coronary artery disease. Further investigation  including an electrocardiogram  stress test  and potential angiography  is warranted.
Coronary artery disease,2,90,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 56-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic complaining of recurring chest discomfort that worsens with activity over the last two months. He describes his chest pain as a dull pressure in the central chest region  which sometimes radiates to his left arm. He has also noticed experiencing shortness of breath and feeling unusually tired when climbing stairs.  This patient is a manager at a local retail chain  working long hours with irregular meal patterns. He states he used to smoke a pack of cigarettes daily for about 20 years but quit ten years ago. He consumes alcohol socially and has a family history of heart disease; his father died of a heart attack at age 60.  Mr. Johnson's past medical history reveals he has been living with type 2 diabetes and hypertension for over seven years  for which he is on Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. He also has hyperlipidemia  controlled with a statin (Atorvastatin). Despite this  he struggles with weight reduction and has a body mass index (BMI) of 32  classifying him as obese.  His vitals today are stable except for a slightly elevated blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg. Further assessment and diagnostic tests have been scheduled to evaluate the severity of his probable coronary artery disease. 
Coronary artery disease,2,91,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic retired engineer  presents to the clinic with complaints of sporadic chest discomfort  irregular heartbeats  and shortness of breath-especially during physical exertion over the past two months. The patient also reports feeling increasingly fatigued  occasional dizziness  and cold sweats. His discomfort tends to lessen with rest and intensify with physical exertion or emotional stress.  His medical history includes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes about eight years ago and hypertension for the past five years. He was a smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has a body mass index of 29  indicating that he is overweight. His father died at 55 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother had a stroke at 75  indicating a significant family history of heart disease. His regular medications include Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. He admits to a low physical activity level due to his recent retirement and confesses that he has been indulging in unhealthy food more frequently.  On examination  his blood pressure is elevated at 145/90mmHg  his heart rate is irregular  and his respiration rate is slightly increased. Sounds heard through a stethoscope reveal mild crepitations at lung bases suggesting fluid overload. On inspection  another significant finding includes mild peripheral edema. No significant findings in the abdominal and neurologic examination.   The findings accurately represent the common demographics and characteristics of individuals with coronary artery disease as indicated in literature: older age  male  heritogeneity  diabetes  hypertension  overweight  and a history of smoking.
Coronary artery disease,2,92,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 64-year-old African American male who comes to the clinic complaining of recurrent chest pain  discomfort in his upper body  shortness of breath  fatigue  and lightheadedness over the last three weeks. He describes the pain as """"heavy"""" or """"pressing"""" and sometimes radiating to his left arm. These symptoms seem to worsen with physical activity but improve with rest.   He works as an accountant and lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He is a smoker with a 20 pack-year history and admits to having a diet high in red meat and processed foods. He has a BMI of 29  which is considered overweight. He states that he only engages in minimal physical activity and mostly leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Mr. Johnson's past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which were diagnosed about 10 years ago. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 65 and his older brother was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. These family histories further increase his own risk for coronary artery disease. He is under medication for his chronic illnesses  taking Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. However  he admits to inconsistently taking his medications.  The combination of his chest pain symptoms  male gender  age group  citizenry  African-American ethnicity  smoking history  poor diet  low physical activity  parental history of heart attack  hypertension  diabetes  overweight  and inconsistent adherence to medication  makes Mr. Johnson a high-risk individual for coronary artery disease."
Coronary artery disease,2,93,Patient Presentation:  John  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  weighs 220 lbs with a height of 6ft  presenting with chest discomfort and shortness of breath on exertion for the past few weeks. John lives in Los Angeles  California and is a retired mechanic. He admits to a 30 pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His diet is high in saturated fats  and his lifestyle is mostly sedentary.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both diagnosed 7 years ago and managed by medications. He also has a familial history of cardiac disease. His father died of a heart attack at 72  and his older brother had a stent placed for coronary artery disease at the age of 63.   John's current medication regimen includes lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension and atorvastatin 40mg daily for hyperlipidemia. He does not have any known drug allergies.   On further questioning  he describes the chest discomfort as a squeezing sensation  lasting for 10-15 minutes and usually relieved by rest. The shortness of breath is typically concurrent with the chest discomfort. He had no known episodes of syncope  but he reports occasional episodes of dizziness particularly on exerting.  The persistent chest discomfort and shortness of breath on exertion  along with his established risk factors  strongly suggest underlying coronary artery disease. The patient needs immediate further evaluations including an EKG and stress testing to assess the severity of the suspected coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,2,94,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Antonio Vega  a 62-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the clinic today with chief complaints of intermittent chest pain radiating to the left arm  especially during physical activities  as well as shortness of breath  and fatigue for the past 2 weeks. He describes the pain as """"tightening"""" that improves with rest. He also reports episodes of lightheadedness but no reports of syncope. There is no history of nausea  vomiting or diaphoresis associated with the pain.  Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin  dyslipidemia managed with a statin  and hypertension controlled with amlodipine and lisinopril. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history but quit 10 years ago. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in processed foods.   He has a family history significant for coronary artery disease; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. He lives with his wife and is retired  they have two adult children.

Coronary artery disease,3,1,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Case Study – Coronary Artery Disease Subtitle: An Overview of Heart Health in Demographic Context  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who is a non-smoker  living in a metropolitan area. - He is slightly overweight with a BMI of 27  works as a shift consultant  and has a history of low physical activity. - The literature suggests the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is comparatively high in this demographic due to lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled by medication. - He has no previous diagnosis of diabetes but shows signs of insulin resistance  suggesting a pre-diabetic state. - The patient was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia two years ago. - His father passed away from a heart attack at age 65  indicating a strong family history of heart disease.  Slide 5: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - CAD  also known as ischemic heart disease  is most commonly due to a buildup of plaques in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the heart. - Risk factors include old age  male sex  smoking  physical inactivity  poor diet  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and family history.  Slide 6: Symptom Presentation - The patient visited the emergency department complaining of recurrent chest pain and shortness of breath  particularly when performing physical activities. - He reported that the pain often spreads to his shoulders  arms  and neck.  - Further cardiac examination suggested symptoms of angina pectoris.  Slide 7: Diagnosis & Treatment - Cardiac diagnostic tests  including electrocardiogram and coronary angiography  confirmed CAD. - The patient was prescribed antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  statins  and lifestyle-modifying measures. - The patient is also advised to have regular follow-ups to monitor his condition.  Slide 8: Connecting Demographics with CAD  - The lifestyle of a metropolitan  desk-bound employee coupled with age and genetic predisposition significantly contributed to his CAD.  - As per literature  men  especially Caucasian men  over the age of 60  have a higher risk for CAD. - This case reinforces the need to focus on preventive strategies  early diagnosis  and management for at-risk demographics.  Slide 9: Conclusion - CAD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.  - Our understanding of the inherent link between CAD and specific demographics can help guide proactive healthcare measures.  End of Presentation.
Coronary artery disease,3,2,Title: A Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease in the Elderly  Slide 1: Introduction - Age: 70-year-old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupations: Retired factory worker  Slide 2: Past Medical History - Hypertension for the past ten years  currently managed with medication. - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes five years ago and is currently under control with diet modification and medications. - Family history of heart disease  his father passed away from a heart attack. - Former smoker  quit smoking 15 years ago. - Low physical activity  sedentary lifestyle.  - Previous history of overweight  current BMI now in a normal range due to recent weight loss.  Slide 3: Presenting Concern  - The patient presents with consistent angina  which has been progressively becoming severe over the past year. Recently  he has been experiencing shortness of breath  dizziness  and excessive sweating on minor exertion.  Slide 4: Diagnosis  - A comprehensive examination including Electrocardiogram (EKG)  Stress Test and ultimately Coronary Angiography confirmed the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). - There is significant obstruction in two out of three major coronary arteries.   Slide 5: Management and Prognosis  - Encouragement of healthy lifestyle changes  such as diet and exercise - Medication for managing symptoms and slowing disease progression i.e.  beta-blockers  calcium channel blockers  nitroglycerin. - Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) could be considered for severe cases. - Regular follow-up for monitoring disease progression and medication side-effects.  Slide 6: Conclusion  - Early diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease are crucial to prevent harmful complications like heart attacks.  - Regular follow-ups for a patient like this are critical due to the combination of CAD  hypertension  and diabetes  making the case severe. - Positive prognosis with lifestyle changes and ongoing treatment.   Please note while this presentation is based on a typical case of CAD  the disease can present differently based on various factors such as genetic predisposition  general health condition  lifestyle etc. Always look at the individual case.
Coronary artery disease,3,3,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease   Slide 1: Introduction This presentation describes a case of a 60-year-old African American male diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent literature shows that African American males are disproportionately affected by CAD  often due to lifestyle factors and unique genetic susceptibilities.   Slide 2: Demographics Our patient is a 60-year-old retired construction supervisor living in Washington  D.C. He is a widower with two adult children. He is a non-smoker but admits to a history of poor dietary habits and infrequent exercise.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient's medical history includes grade 2 hypertension and dyslipidemia  well-managed with medication. Notably  the patient's mother died early from CAD. Unfortunately  this family history further elevates his risk for CAD.   Slide 4: Presentation Mr. Smith presented to the doctor with frequent chest pain and shortness of breath  particularly when engaging in physical activities. He also experienced episodes of indigestion that he initially associated with dietary issues.  Slide 5: Diagnosis CAD was suspected based on his symptoms and risk factors. ECG showed T-wave inversion  and subsequent angiography confirmed significant occlusions in his coronary arteries. He was then formally diagnosed with CAD.  Slide 6: Management and Prognosis The patient was prescribed a regimen of aspirin  statins  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and beta-blockers. He underwent angioplasty and had a stent placed in the obstructed artery. Lifestyle modifications  including a heart-healthy diet  exercise  and cardiac rehabilitation  were also encouraged. With compliance  the prognosis for this patient is cautiously optimistic. However  it reinforces the importance of screening and prevention strategies in at-risk populations.    Slide 7: Conclusion This case highlights the importance of considering CAD in patients with known risk factors  even if their symptoms may seem unremarkable. Regular follow-ups and aggressive management of modifiable risk factors in such high-risk patients are essential in preventing any cardiovascular event.

Coronary artery disease,3,7,Title: A Brief Study of a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Slide 1: Introduction  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common heart conditions  impacting millions of adults globally. It is typically characterized by damage or disease in the heart's major blood vessels. CAD is strongly associated with major health risk factors such as high blood pressure  high cholesterol  obesity  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 2: Demographic Details   Our subject for this study is Mr. Smith. He is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  representative of the demographic group most commonly affected by CAD. This demographic is consistently represented in medical literature as being the most at risk for CAD  which increases with age  particularly among men and postmenopausal women.  Slide 3: Lifestyle and Occupational History  Mr. Smith is a retired mechanical engineer who led a largely sedentary lifestyle during his professional years. He has a 35-pack year history of smoking  although he has managed to quit smoking for the last five years. His diet mainly includes high saturated fat food items with a slight preference for sugary drinks  which is indicative of an unhealthy dietary pattern.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both untreated. He has a family history of CAD - his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.   Slide 5: Symptomatology and Diagnosis   Recently  Mr. Smith has complained of discomfort in the chest region  particularly on exertion  which reduces at rest. He has reported feelings of pressure  heaviness  and burning sensation in the chest. Occasionally  he also experiences shortness of breath and fatigue  indicative of angina pectoris. Mr. Smith was diagnosed with CAD upon clinical examination and confirmed following an angiogram.  Slide 6: Management and Recommendations   Mr. Smith has been advised a healthy eating plan and regular exercise to manage his weight and reduce his cholesterol levels. He has been prescribed antiplatelet drugs  beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins. He will undergo revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Additionally  he has been recommended smoking cessation therapies  diabetes control  and control of hypertension to prevent further complications.  Slide 7: Conclusion  CAD is a serious condition that requires holistic  multidimensional care. By managing Mr. Smith's high blood pressure and cholesterol  addressing his sedentary lifestyle  and improving his diet  we can significantly impact his quality of life and cardiac health prognosis. Continued patient education and encouragement are fundamental to his long-term health status.

Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  which are effectively managed with lifestyle modifications and medication. He has been a smoker for 25 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. There’s a family history of cardiovascular diseases: his father died at the age of 60 from a heart attack and his older brother had a bypass surgery at the age of 55.  III. Case Presentation:  Mr. Johnson presented to the outpatient clinic with chief complaints of discomfort and pressure typical of angina in the centre of the chest  particularly during physical exertion  for the last couple of months. The symptoms are relieved by rest but have gradually been increasing in frequency and intensity. He denies symptoms of shortness of breath  palpitations  dizziness  and syncope. He has been noticing some episodes of post-meal fullness and belching.  On further questioning  Mr. Johnson also reported associated fatigue  mild weight loss  and decreased exercise tolerance. He continually keeps tabs on his blood sugar levels and blood pressure at home; these values haven't seen any significant variations recently. His current medications include Metformin and Lisinopril.  IV. Physical Examination:  A thorough physical examination is conducted  emphasizing cardiovascular examination. It revealed that Mr. Johnson was anisocoric with bilateral pupil sizes within the normal range  cheeks slightly flushed. His BP was 140/90 mmHg; Pulse - 80/minute  regular; Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs or gallops; lung fields were clear bilaterally.   V. Differential and Possible Diagnosis:  Mr. Johnson's age  gender  past medical history  and clinical presentation significantly raise the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). The clinician should also consider possible differential diagnoses  such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD)  Pancoast tumor  and hiatal hernia  which can also present with similar chest symptoms.   VI. Investigations:  Given Mr. Johnson's history and clinical presentation  the following investigations are necessary: laboratory tests  including CBC  FBS  lipid profile  ECG  exercise stress test  and possibly an angiography  considering the high index of suspicion for CAD.  VII. Conclusion:  CAD is a common condition in elderly male populations  especially those with risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and smoking history. Early recognition and effective management are critical for preventing significant cardiovascular events like coronary artery occlusion.

Coronary artery disease,3,32,Title: A Clinical Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease  Slide 1: Introduction Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most commonly encountered pathologies in clinical practice. It predominantly affects the elderly population  it is observed that men are more likely to be diagnosed with CAD at an earlier age compared to women. It is closely associated with comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case is about a 68-year-old African American male. According to the CDC  CAD is more prevalent in African American males aged 60 years and above compared to their Caucasian counterparts.  Slide 3: Past medical history The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which he has been managing for 15 years. He is a smoker with a 20-pack-year history. He also has a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity and consumes a diet high in fats and carbohydrates.  Slide 4: Presentation of Symptoms The patient presented with a history of chest pain  exacerbated by physical exertion and relieved by rest. The pain was described as 'crushing' in nature  radiating to the left shoulder and associated with shortness of breath.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Work-Up The EKG revealed signs of myocardial ischemia - ST segment depressions and T wave inversion. His blood investigations showed elevated cardiac enzymes (Troponin and CPK-MB). An exercise stress test was positive for ischemia. Finally  coronary angiography demonstrated significant (>70%) occlusion of left anterior descending artery (LAD).  Slide 6: Management Given the symptomatology and diagnostic findings  the patient was taken up for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) of the LAD. He was advised lifestyle modifications including regular aerobic exercise  balanced diet restricting salt and fatty foods. He was also advised smoking cessation  stringent control of his hypertension and diabetes  along with medication regimen that included aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case study emphasizes the importance of managing patient comorbidities  maintaining a high index of suspicion for CAD particularly in high-risk demographics  and ensuring early diagnosis and optimal intervention to improve patient outcomes. 
Coronary artery disease,3,33,Title: A Case Evaluation of Coronary Artery Disease in Hispanic Middle-aged Adult  Slide 1: Introduction  Coronary artery disease  one of the most common heart diseases  involves the narrowing or blocking of the coronary arteries due to cholesterol and plaque deposition. It's a significant global burden  striking indiscriminately across all social and ethnic groups. Our presentation today revolves around a Hispanic male patient who falls within the highest demographic risk for coronary artery disease.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Patient X is a 55-year-old Hispanic male  living in Houston  Texas. Hispanic men represent a significant portion of the population suffering from coronary artery disease  indicating an alarming ethnic disparity. Texas  with its dense Hispanic population  records higher rates of CAD patients.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Patient X has Type 2 Diabetes - a significant risk factor for cardiovascular conditions. He also has a history of smoking and reveals a family history of coronary artery diseases  which further escalates the risk. However  Patient X maintains moderate physical activity and adheres to a diet  which somewhat counterbalance his risk profile.  Slide 4: Details of Current Condition  Even though his diabetic condition is managed with oral medications  the patient recently started complaining about experiencing chest discomfort and shortness of breath. After undergoing stress tests and an electrocardiogram  obstructions in his coronary artery were identified  confirming the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.  Slide 5: Associations with Demographics and Disease Prevalence  Research shows that certain genetic dispositions in Hispanic populations - particularly Mexican Americans - can lead to elevated risk factors (like Type 2 diabetes) that contribute to higher CAD prevalence. The ethnic inequality in health care access and quality also intensifies the condition.  Slide 6: Discussion  Patient X's case underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the heightened risk levels in certain demographic groups due to genetic  socio-economic  and lifestyle factors. In preventative care  patient education and culturally sensitive interventions can play an essential role in minimizing CAD impact on high-risk communities.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Understanding the demographic disparities in coronary artery disease prevalence assists medical professionals in providing specialized care. By investigating such a case  we can help devise tactics to reduce disease prevalence within significantly affected communities and improve their health outcomes.

Coronary artery disease,3,35,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in a Middle-aged Female: A Case Presentation   Slide 1: Introduction  Good afternoon everyone. Today we shall discuss a case of a 58-year-old African-American female patient  codenamed Mrs. L  who has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD).  Slide 2: Demographics  Mrs. L is from a low-income community. African-Americans  particularly women  have been cited having higher morbidity and mortality from CAD. As well  low socioeconomic status is associated with higher prevalence of CAD.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mrs. L was diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension five years ago  which she has been managing with medications. She has a 30-pack year smoking history and a strong family history of heart disease. These factors are known to increase the risk of CAD.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms   Mrs. L presented to the clinic with central chest pain that radiates to her left arm and intermittent shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. These symptoms have been occurring over the past six months but have progressively worsened.  Slide 5: Physical Examination   Her body mass index is 33  placing her in the obese category. Her blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg. All these factors further increase her risk for CAD.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests   The ECG demonstrates T wave inversions which can indicate myocardial ischemia. The cardiac enzymes Troponin T and I are also slightly elevated which suggests recent heart damage. Further  a stress test was positive for inducible ischemia.  Slide 7: Conclusion   Given her presenting symptoms  risk factors  and confirmed tests  Mrs. L has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.

Coronary artery disease,3,36,Title: Case Study of Coronary Artery Disease in an Elderly Caucasian Male   Slide 1: Introduction Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease in the United States  affecting approximately 16.5 million people aged 20 and over. CAD is more prevalent in men compared to women  and the risk increases with advancing age.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case involves a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Brown. He is a retired engineer  married with two children  and lives in a suburban neighborhood.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Brown has a documented history of hypertension and has been a smoker for the past 40 years  both of which significantly increase his risk for CAD. He also has a family history of heart disease – both his father and paternal grandfather were diagnosed with CAD in their early 60s.  Slide 4: Symptoms and Diagnosis Mr. Brown presented with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm  shortness of breath following minor exertion  and episodes of dizziness. On examination  he showed signs of obesity and mild peripheral edema. His ECG showed possible signs of myocardial ischemia and later confirmed by a stress test and coronary angiography.  Slide 5: Treatment and Management Mr. Brown was started on a regimen of antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  and statins to manage his coronary artery disease as recommended by ACC/AHA guidelines. He was encouraged to make drastic lifestyle changes  including quitting smoking  adopting a cardiac-friendly diet  losing weight  and incorporating regular exercise into his daily routine.  Slide 6: Follow up and Prognosis Regular follow-ups were scheduled  focusing on monitoring Mr. Brown's symptoms  blood pressure  and cholesterol levels. Changes to his medication plan were made as necessary. Given Mr. Brown's demographic and medical history  he is at a high risk for complications related to CAD  including heart failure and arrhythmias. Hence  adherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications are critical to his prognosis.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case highlights the effect of lifestyle choices and how they often combine with genetic predisposition to exacerbate CAD risks. It underscores the necessity of considering all aspects of a patient's health – including demographic factors  lifestyle choices  and medical history – when diagnosing  treating  and managing coronary artery disease.

Coronary artery disease,3,37,Title: A Case Study on Coronary Artery Disease  Slide 1: Introduction According to the American Heart Association (2018)  coronary artery disease (CAD) affects an estimated 16.5 million Americans aged 20 years and above. Highlighting this significant public health concern  our case study today will focus on a typical patient diagnosed with CAD.  Slide 2: Demographics Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired factory worker hailing from Lincoln  Nebraska. He lives with his wife and has a strong family history of heart disease. CDC data suggests that CAD is most prevalent in Caucasian males over the age of 45  highlighting the representation in our case (CDC  2020).   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which he manages with medication and lifestyle modifications. He does not smoke but was a smoker until his early 40s. Additionally  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol about 15 years ago. His BMI categorizes him as obese  and he admits that maintaining a regular exercise routine has been challenging.   Slide 4: Symptoms and Diagnosis Over the past month  Mr. Johnson has experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath  particularly during exertion. An EKG  stress test  and coronary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of CAD. He showed significant blockages in his two major coronaries - the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery.   Slide 5: Risk Factors  Mr. Johnson's major CAD risk factors include his age  gender  family history  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  previous smoking habit  high cholesterol  and obesity. A sedentary lifestyle also contributes to the risk.  Slide 6: Therapeutic Management  Mr. Johnson is put on a regimen of medications such as beta blockers  calcium channel blockers  aspirin  and cholesterol-lowering drugs. He is referred to a dietary counselor for a heart-healthy diet  and a physiotherapist for guided regular exercise. Angioplasty with stent placement is considered to open up clogged arteries.  Slide 7: Conclusion and Future Perspectives  CAD  as seen in Mr. Johnson's case  is a complex disease with a multitude of overlapping risk factors. While medical intervention is crucial  lifestyle modifications play an equally important role in managing the disease. Education about the disease and adherence to prescribed therapy can make a significant difference in improving quality of life and preventing future cardiac events.

Coronary artery disease,3,44,Title: A Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease  Case Introduction: Today  we will be discussing the case of Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African-American male with a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Literature shows that CAD remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide  imposing a huge health burden (Benjamin et al.  2018). Age  race  and gender are key demographic factors in CAD prevalence. African-American men  especially those aged 65 and above  are at a significantly higher risk of developing CAD (Yazdanyar & Newman  2009).   Patient History: Mr. Doe is a retired military officer who lives with his wife. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years. Apart from this  he’s been diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both known risk factors for CAD (Booth et al.  2014). His mother passed away at the age of 72 from a heart attack  suggesting a possible family history of heart disease.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Doe reported episodes of chest discomfort that typically lasts for a few minutes  which he described as heaviness  radiating to his left arm. He noticed that these pains often occurred during physical activity or emotional stress but relieved by rest  indicative of angina pectoris  a trademark symptom of CAD.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment depression  suggestive of myocardial ischemia. His lipid profile is abnormal  with an LDL cholesterol level of 160 mg/dl and HDL cholesterol of 35 mg/dl  which further increased his risk for CAD. An exercise stress test was positive for myocardial ischemia. Consequently  a coronary angiography was performed which detected significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.  Conclusion: Mr. Doe's case is a classic representation of a patient with CAD. His demographic data  past medical history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and smoking  as well as family history of heart disease  all contribute to his current condition. Early detection and management of modifiable risk factors is crucial in controlling the progression of CAD.  References: - Benjamin  E. J.  et al. (2018).

Coronary artery disease,3,46,Title: Understanding a Clinical Presentation of Coronary Artery Disease  Slide 1: Introduction Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  also known as ischemic heart disease  is a leading cause of death worldwide. It primarily affects men and populations of high-income countries. The disease predominantly affects individuals above 65 years of age. Today  we'll be discussing a typical case of CAD to deepen our understanding of the disease.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr. James  is a 68-year-old African-American male from middle-income background. He is a retired serviceman and lives in an urban setting with his wife. He has a family history of CAD  with his father having passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 72.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. James was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 10 years ago. He is also hypertensive  a condition that was discovered 7 years prior. He has been on medication for both conditions which are fairly well-controlled. Additionally  Mr. James was a smoker but quit 15 years ago. He leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle and has a BMI that classifies him as overweight.  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation Recently  he has been experiencing chest pain that radiates to his left shoulder and arm. The pain is often associated with shortness of breath and cold sweats  and usually occurs during physical exertion or stress  but has recently been occurring even at rest.  Slide 5: Preliminary Diagnosis and Rationale Given the age  sex  ethnicity  history of smoking  and existing conditions of Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension  Mr. James fits into the high-risk category for coronary artery disease. His symptoms of chest pain  radiating discomfort  and dyspnea on exertion are indicative of angina  suggestive of coronary artery blockage.   Slide 6: Investigations and Confirming Diagnosis A thorough clinical evaluation  including an ECG  stress test  echocardiogram  and coronary angiogram  will likely be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis and explore treatment options.  Slide 7: Concluding Remarks  This case highlights the importance of understanding the demographic and lifestyle factors contributing to CAD  as well as recognizing its signs and symptoms for timely intervention. It underlines the need for comprehensive management approaches  including lifestyle modification and  if necessary  procedural interventions.

Coronary artery disease,3,47,Slide 1:  Title: Case Presentation: A Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Slide 2:  Title: Demographics According to the World Health Organization  coronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide  affecting both males and females. Data from the American Heart Association in 2018 showed that approx. 18.2 million adults aged 20 years and older in the USA have CAD.  Today's case study focuses on a Hispanic male  Mr. Hernandez  aged 62 years old from southern Texas. This demographic is chosen as according to the literature  CAD is the leading cause of death among the Hispanic population.   Slide 3:  Title: Past Medical History Mr. Hernandez has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Hypertension (HTN)  both controlled with medications for about ten years. He is also a former smoker who quit six years ago. His father died at the age of 56 due to a heart attack. Mr. Hernandez has a sedentary lifestyle and admits to having a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables.  These factors contribute to his risk of developing CAD due to the accumulation of fatty plaques in his coronary arteries  which can result in a decreased blood supply to the heart muscle  causing heart-related symptoms and problems.  Slide 4: Title: Conclusion In conclusion  Mr. Hernandez represents a common scenario seen in clinical practice. His age  ethnic background  gender  unhealthy dietary habits  sedentary lifestyle  T2DM  HTN  smoking history  and familial predisposition all increase his risk for CAD. Early identification and management of risk factors could help prevent the progression of the disease.   Slide 5:  Title: Discussion Point Engaging in a healthy lifestyle is critical for CAD prevention  especially for high-risk groups. Medical educators play a vital role in informing patients about modifiable risk factors and preventive measures. Let's discuss potential interventions that we could recommend to Mr. Hernandez and similarly situated patients.

Coronary artery disease,3,52,Title: A Case Study on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Slide 1: Introduction  Our case revolves around a 68-year-old African American male diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). African Americans have higher rates of CAD  but lower rates of coronary revascularization than their white counterparts.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a retired factory worker who resides in an urban area. He has lived most of his life in moderate socio-economic conditions  a factor that has been established to influence CAD outcomes.   Slide 3: Lifestyle  The patient has been a smoker for 35 years  averaging one pack per day. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a diet high in saturated fats  both of which are risk factors for CAD.  Slide 4: Medical History  Explored findings reveal that he was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes 15 years back. Both conditions have not been optimally managed  increasing his risk further for CAD.  Slide 5: Past CAD History  He was first diagnosed with CAD six years ago after presenting with anginal chest pain. Since then  he has had two percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs).  Slide 6: Family History  His late father had CAD and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at the age of 60. He died of myocardial infarction 8 years later. This family history places our patient at a higher risk of developing severe CAD.  Slide 7: Current Presentation  The patient recently reported worsening chest pain upon exertion and shortness of breath  indicating the possibility of a severe or worsening CAD condition.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case reflects the unfortunate reality of individuals in certain demographic groups and socioeconomic conditions who are predisposed to developing CAD due to various lifestyle factors and systemic disease management issues.

Coronary artery disease,3,54,**Title: Case Study Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease in a Geriatric Patient**  **Slide 1: Introduction**  This case study presents Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male  an age and racial demographic statistically associated with higher incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) - as represented in literature.  **Slide 2**: Patient Profile & History  Mr. Doe is a retired bank clerk  living alone. He is a non-smoker with a history of hypertension  and type 2 diabetes controlled by oral medication. Both conditions present significant risk factors for CAD. Family history reveals two first-degree relatives (father and brother) experienced heart attacks in their 60s  indicating a genetic predisposition.   **Slide 3**: Presentation   Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain  radiating to his left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These symptoms are typical of angina pectoris  common amongst CAD patients.  **Slide 4**: Diagnosis  Doctors conducted an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed ST-segment depression and T-wave inversions suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Blood tests revealed elevated cardiac markers - troponin and Creatine Kinase Myocardial Band (CK-MB)  confirming ischemia. Further  patients coronary angiography showed significant narrowings in the major coronary arteries.  **Slide 5**: Treatment  Mr. Doe was immediately prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain relief  Aspirin and Clopidogrel as antiplatelet agents  and a Statin to manage his cholesterol levels. He was further recommended coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  **Slide 6**: Discussion  This case exemplifies the role of multiple risk factors in the development of CAD: ethnicity  age  hypertension  diabetes  and family history. The intersectionality of these factors should be factored into early detection strategies and therapeutic decisions in patients at-risk for CAD.  **Slide 7: Conclusion and Further Thoughts**  Mr. Doe’s case allows valuable insights into the management of CAD in patients with similar demographics. His adherence to prescribed lifestyle changes and pharmaceutical interventions following surgery will be integral to managing disease progression and ensuring the best possible prognosis. Further population studies would assist in determining better prevention and treatment strategies in high-risk ethnic groups. 
Coronary artery disease,3,55,"Title: A Case Study of Coronary Artery Disease   Slide 1: Introduction  A study of a 65-year old African American male presenting signs of coronary artery disease (CAD). Race  age  and gender play a significant role in the prevalence of the disease. Gender and age are notable risk factors  with men and the elderly being more susceptible. African Americans have been reported to have a higher incidence of CAD  along with hypertension and diabetes which increases the risks.   Slide 2: Demographic Details  The case pertains to Mr X  a 65-year-old retired teacher. He hails from a lower-middle-class family in Chicago. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. He is a non-smoker but has a sedentary lifestyle and a diet rich in fats and cholesterol.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr X's medical history reveals he is hypertensive  managed with medication for the last eight years. He is also marginally overweight - a BMI of 26. Mr X also has Type II diabetes  poorly controlled  for which he's been on metformin for ten years. Both hypertension and diabetes are critical risk factors for CAD.  Slide 4: Current Symptoms   Mr X recently experienced episodes of chest pain  especially during exertion or stress. He described it as """"crushing"""" pain radiating to his left arm and neck  occurring intermittently and subsiding with rest. This chest pain known as angina  is commonly indicative of an underlying CAD.   Slide 5: Diagnosis  The diagnosis will be based on his symptoms  electrocardiogram (ECG) findings  stress testing  and if necessary  a coronary angiogram to evaluate the extent of blockage in the coronary arteries.  Slide 6: Conclusion   Mr X's case highlights the importance of managing hypertension and diabetes. It underlines the need to seek immediate professional help when experiencing symptoms of potential CAD  considering their heightened risk for African American males over the age of 60. Immense focus needs to be placed on prevention  early diagnosis  and treatment of CAD in this high-risk demographic.   Slide 7: Prevention & Management  Prevention here emphasises on lifestyle changes such as regular exercise  balanced diet  weight management  and good control of diabetes and hypertension. Appropriate first-line treatment for Mr X would involve medications like aspirin  nitroglycerin for acute angina attacks  statins  and beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers depending upon his tolerance and response. In severe cases of obstruction  revascularization procedures like angioplasty  stenting or coronary bypass surgery may be required. "

Coronary artery disease,3,65,[Slide 1: Introduction]  Title: A case study of a patient with Coronary Artery Disease   This presentation aims to provide an overview of a case of a patient with coronary artery disease  detailing the patient's demographic background  past medical history  present diagnosis  and treatment.  [Slide 2: Demographics]  Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who recently retired from his job in corporate banking. This demographic details align well with the fact that coronary artery disease is reported to be most prevalent amongst men  especially over the age of 45  and the incidence rate is significantly higher amongst Caucasians.  [Slide 3: Lifestyle]  As a corporate banker  Mr. Johnson led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. In addition  he has a history of smoking and a moderate consumption of alcohol. His diet often consists of high fat  processed food  contributing to his overweight status.   [Slide 4: Past Medical History]  Mr. Johnson has a known history of hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  and Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed five years ago. Both hypertension and diabetes are known risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. Unfortunately  Johnson has been inconsistent with his medications over the years and has made incomplete lifestyle modifications.   [Slide 5: Current Diagnosis]  A few months back  Mr. Johnson began experiencing episodes of chest pain  tightness  and shortness of breath. After undergoing various diagnostic tests  including an electrocardiogram  stress test  and coronary angiogram  he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. The test revealed significant blockages in two of his coronary arteries.  [Slide 6: Treatment Plan]  His current treatment regime consists of medication therapy including statins  beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  along with a recommendation for revascularization through Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). In addition  Mr. Johnson has been strongly advised to adopt healthier lifestyle practices  including a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  smoking cessation  and consistent management of his hypertension and diabetes.  [Slide 7: Conclusion]  In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's case highlights the interplay between lifestyle choices  pre-existing conditions  and the development of coronary artery disease. It underlines the importance of early detection  consistent management of risk factors  and adherence to treatment plans in mitigating the progression of this potentially serious condition.
Coronary artery disease,3,66,Title: A Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Slide 1: Introduction Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a highly prevalent condition  principally affecting older adults  with higher prevalence amongst males  individuals with a family history of CAD  and certain ethnic populations such as South Asians.  Slide 2: Patient Introduction Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male  Mr. Johnson.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus controlled through oral hypoglycemics  and Dyslipidemia being managed with statins. He's a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago. There's a paternal history of CAD  as his father had his first myocardial infarction at age 65.   Slide 4: Presenting Complaint  Mr. Johnson presented with complaints of intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath  chiefly on exertion for the past two months  and states that these symptoms have gradually been worsening in severity.  Slide 5: Assessment Upon physical examination and EKG  findings were suggestive of CAD and further assessments were planned. Risk assessment tools like the Framingham Risk Score were utilized  and Mr. Johnson's score indicated a high risk.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Evaluation An Exercise Stress Test revealed abnormalities at an intermediate work level and was hence indicative of significant CAD. Following Coronary Angiography  it was confirmed that Mr. Johnson had severe three-vessel CAD.  Slide 7: Intervention Considering Mr. Johnson's extensive disease  medical management alone wouldn't be sufficient and so he was offered Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).  Slide 8: Conclusion This case underscores the high susceptibility of individuals with demographic and clinical profiles similar to Mr. Johnson's to CAD. It underlines the importance of early recognition of symptoms  timely diagnostic interventions  and comprehensive management strategies.   Slide 9: References Lastly  we present the list of literature and sources from which this case and respective information were taken to ensure utmost accuracy.   Slide 10: Questions Open the floor for questions and interactive discussion.
Coronary artery disease,3,67,Introduction ----------------- Today  we will be discussing the case of a patient diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). This condition affects about 16.5 million Americans each year  with a higher prevalence in men and in individuals aged 60 years and above.  Patient Demographics ------------------------------- The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired  whose occupation was a truck driver implying a sedentary lifestyle for most of his working life. The choice of this demographic is backed by studies that show the prevalence of CAD is higher among Caucasian men  people aged above 60  and those living sedentary lives.   Past Medical History ---------------------------- Upon reviewing his medical history  it was found that the patient has a long-standing history of hypertension and type II diabetes  both are well-known risk factors for CAD. The patient had been taking antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications for the past 15 years.   There is also a significant history of smoking. The patient admits to a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit about 5 years ago. This personal history of tobacco use contributes another strong risk factor for his disease.  He has a family history of CAD as well. His father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. As heart disease is partly influenced by genetic factors  family history should always be considered in diagnosing CAD.  On questioning  the patient admitted that he didn't follow a healthy diet and was not engaged in regular physical activity which increases his risk for CAD.   Conclusion -------------- In conclusion  this patient’s age  sex  family history  personal medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and his past heavy smoking habit puts him at an escalated risk for developing coronary artery disease. Managing such cases requires vigilant monitoring and patient education about lifestyle modifications along with medication. A coordinated effort from healthcare providers and the patient can control the progress of the disease and improve the patient's quality of life.

Coronary artery disease,3,81,Title: A Hypothetical Case Study on Coronary Artery Disease   Introduction:   Today we examine a hypothetical case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This case exemplifies what is typical in a large portion of the U.S. population since CAD is more prevalent in males and incidence increases with age.   Demographic Information:   Our patient  known henceforth as Mr. Smith  is a 63-year-old Caucasian American man. As per the CDC (2019)  CAD is the most common type of heart disease in the USA  from which people aged 65 years or older are most at risk. Additionally  the disease is more prevalent in men with 18.3% of men suffering from CAD compared to 13.2% of women  emphasizing the representative nature of this case.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  which are common risk factors for CAD. He is currently on metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension.  He has a family history of heart disease; his father had a heart attack at the age of 55. Furthermore  he is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago but has a cumulative smoking history of 20 pack-years. Mr. Smith is physically inactive and follows a diet primarily high in saturated fats  which has resulted in obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.  Present Complaints & Symptoms:  Mr. Smith presents with a 6-month history of angina  described as a pressure-like chest discomfort occurring with exertion and is relieved by rest. The chest pain generally lasts for about 5-10 minutes. In the past week  he has noticed the episodes of chest discomfort occurring more frequently and even at rest.  From this case study  we are aiming to understand the pathophysiology  clinical features  diagnosis  treatment  and prevention strategies for CAD. Also  the case will shed light on the correlation between lifestyle factors  comorbid conditions  and the development of CAD.  With the increasing prevalence of CAD  especially in older males  lessons from this case can be used by healthcare providers for the effective management and prevention of this disease in similar patient populations.   This study is also intended to emphasize the importance of managing chronic conditions  such as diabetes and hypertension  and adjusting lifestyle habits in reducing the risk of CAD.

Slide 3: Lifestyle Factors   Title: Lifestyle Factors Text: The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years  with sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet rich in saturated fats. Literature clearly indicates that these behaviors increase the risk of CAD development.  Slide 4: Medical History Overview   Title: Medical History Text: The patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  conditions known for their role in promoting atherosclerosis and CAD development. Over the past few years  he has not been stringent on his medication schedule nor made significant lifestyle changes recommended by his GP.   Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms  Title: Presenting Symptoms Text: Patient presented with a 6-month history of intermittent chest pain (angina). The angina primarily occurs during exertion and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Recently  there's an increase in frequency and intensity of the chest pain.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Findings  Title: Diagnosis Text: Based on the presenting symptoms  past medical history  demographics  and subsequent ECG and angiography results  the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) was established.   Slide 7: Conclusion  Title: Conclusion  Text: This presentation has outlined how significant the role of demographics and past medical history in CAD prediction and diagnosis. The literature emphasizes the importance of risk factor management for CAD prevention  highlighting the need for increased healthcare education in high-risk populations such as the one represented by this patient.

Coronary artery disease,5,1,"Patient Profile: Mr. Johnston  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  owns a small business and is relatively sedentary in his lifestyle. He has a history of smoking about a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. He is married  has two adult children  and is socio-economically middle class.  Relevant Medical History: Mr. Johnston has a medical history significant for hypertension which is inconsistently controlled with lisinopril. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus  currently managed with metformin. Further  he exhibits a marked dyslipidemia. His mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  with a significant family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Mr. Johnston's body mass index (BMI) is 32  positioning him in the obese category. He has no known allergies.  Presentation and Symptoms: Mr. Johnston presents with a 2-week history of progressive exertional chest discomfort  often radiating to his left arm. He reports symptoms to typically last 5-10 minutes when he takes breaks but with increased frequency and intensity over the past three days. He describes the pain as """"pressure-like."""" The pain is associated with dyspnea and occasional diaphoresis but no nausea  vomiting  or syncope. He reports he has never experienced the pain at rest.  The compilation of the history  symptoms  and risk factors suggest that Mr. Johnston is presenting with angina pectoris secondary to progression of coronary artery disease. Immediate evaluation and appropriate treatment are required given his high-risk profile (age  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia) and the severity of symptoms."
Coronary artery disease,5,2,Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 20-pack year smoking history. He presents with a chief complaint of exertional chest pain for the past three weeks. Symptom description encompasses a sensation of heaviness and tightness in the chest  radiating to the left arm  accompanied by episodes of shortness of breath. These episodes last for approximately ten minutes and are relieved by rest. The patient also reports associated symptoms including indigestion  excessive sweating  and feeling fatigued even after minimal physical activity. He denies any history of severe physical trauma  drug use  and no known drug allergies. Family history is significant for his father who had an myocardial infarction at the age of 60. On examination  the patient was noticed to be obese (BMI: 31)  with a diastolic murmur heard on auscultation and electrocardiogram revealing possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Coronary artery disease,5,3,Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Patient: 65-year-old Asian male   Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension and a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed by medication. He also has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit 5 years ago. Both his father and older brother died from myocardial infarctions in their early 70s. He has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient has been experiencing increasing bouts of exertional chest pain over the past 3 months. He reports the pain as a squeezing pressure in his chest  which often radiates to his left shoulder and arm. The patient notes the pain usually occurs after walking up hills or carrying heavy objects and is often relieved after resting. He also reports occasional shortness of breath and a recent increase in fatigue.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is overweight with a body mass index of 29. His blood pressure is 145/95 mmHg and heart rate is regular at 80 beats per minute. His subsequent electrocardiogram shows signs of possible ischemia.  This patient's symptoms  medical history  and demographic details suggest he may be experiencing stable angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. His risk factors include being a male over 60  Asian ethnicity  significant smoking history  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and a family history of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,5,4,Demographics: A 62-year-old African American male.   Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of type II diabetes mellitus  well-controlled with Metformin. He also has a history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Atorvastatin. The patient was advised by his previous physician to quit smoking  which he successfully did approximately 8 years ago. He has a family history of early-onset heart disease — his father died of myocardial infarction at 56.  Presentation: The patient presents with an ongoing intermittent chest pain radiating to left arm  lasting for more than a month  especially on exertion but recently also at rest. The patient describes the pain as a squeezing or burning sensation in the center of his chest. The pain is often relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Recently  he also complains about an increasing shortness of breath on exertion  unusual fatigue  and sleep disturbance. His vital signs are stable  but a physical examination reveals diminished bilateral lower extremity pulses  suggesting atherosclerosis. Electrocardiogram reveals T-wave inversions suggestive of ischemia  warranting further investigations including cardiac enzyme tests and an angiogram.   This case presentation is consistent with an individual suffering from coronary artery disease  possibly angina pectoris  with a strong need for further diagnostic evaluation for confirmation and immediate therapeutic intervention. Given the patient's racial background  he is statistically at a higher risk for developing heart disease according to the latest research. His history of type II diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and family history of heart disease also notably contribute to his risk.
Coronary artery disease,5,5,"Patient is a 68-year-old  African-American male  retired truck driver  long-term smoker with a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and high cholesterol  and reports a 20-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day. His hypertension and diabetes are both reportedly under control with prescribed medication. The patient presents with persistent chest pain  described as """"pressure-like"""" and centralized behind the sternum. There is mention of associated symptoms including shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and sporadic episodes of diaphoresis  especially during episodes of exertion. These symptoms have reportedly worsened over the past month. The patient denies any recent history of fever  chronic cough  or unexpected weight loss."
Coronary artery disease,5,6,Patient Information: 62-year-old Hispanic male  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus  all of which are well-controlled with medication. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 67.   Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a two-week history of intermittent anginal chest pain  typically precipitated by physical exertion and relieved by rest. He has experienced an increase in frequency of these episodes over the last 48 hours.   Physical Assessment Findings: On examination  vital signs were stable. Heart sounds were normal with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. No abnormal breath sounds. There wasn't any swelling in his legs. His BMI was 29.   Diagnostic Findings: Electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the anterior leads. Troponin level was slightly elevated. The patient's cholesterol level is also high with low levels of high-density lipoprotein and high levels of low-density lipoprotein.  Problem Representation: This 62-year-old patient with multiple typical risk factors for coronary artery disease (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  family history of premature coronary artery disease  former smoker  and overweight) now presents with symptoms and preliminary investigations suggestive of unstable angina due to likely underlying coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,5,7,Patient Profile: A 67-year-old African-American male  Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has been a smoker for approximately 40 years and has a family history of early onset heart disease  with his father having a myocardial infarction at age 52. His BMI categorizes him as obese. He is non-compliant with his prescribed diabetic and antihypertensive medications. Occasionally he experiences episodes of brief  vague chest discomfort with exertion  but he has yet to seek treatment for them  attributing these symptoms to age and over-exertion.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presents to the emergency department with moderate  central chest pain of a pressing quality  radiating to his left arm  that started about an hour ago. He also describes associated symptoms of shortness of breath  nausea  lightheadedness  and diaphoresis. He categorizes the chest pain as more severe than his usual episodes.  Problem: Given the patient's age  significant smoking history  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  his family history of heart disease and the important features of his symptoms  the leading medical concern is coronary artery disease manifesting as unstable angina or an acute myocardial infarction.

He also has a high BMI (32) and a pack-a-day smoking history over the past 40 years. He has hyperlipidemia and there is a strong familial history of heart disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 70.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient registered at the clinic reporting progressive chest pain which he describes as """"pressure-like """" originating in the center of the chest and occasionally radiating to his left arm. Episodes typically last for 10-15 minutes and are precipitated by physical activity (e.g.  climbing stairs) and emotional stress. His symptoms are often relieved by rest  but have been getting worse and more frequent over the past 2 months. He also reports intermittent episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue. His symptoms also seem to occur while at rest  which he describes as waking him from sleep.   This representation indicates a patient presenting with symptoms consistent with stable angina as a consequence of coronary artery disease. Given his significant risk factors including age  male gender  hypertension  diabetes  smoking  obesity  hyperlipidemia  and family history  he is at high risk for myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular events. The alarm is now being rang by the worsening of his symptoms even at rest which is a warning sign of an impending heart attack."

Coronary artery disease,5,34,Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a chief complaint of intermittent chest pain that is provoked by physical exertion and relieved by rest.  Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He is a 20-pack-year smoker and has been trying to quit smoking for the last 2 years. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 75.  Physical Exam: The patient's blood pressure was elevated at 160/95 mmHg and his body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 29.5 kg/m2  indicating that he is overweight. He appears short of breath following a brief walk from the waiting area to the examination room. Pulmonary auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally.  Laboratory Findings: The patient's latest lipid panel showed hyperlipidemia with a total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL  HDL of 35 mg/dL  and LDL of 160 mg/dL. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.5%  indicating suboptimal control of his type 2 diabetes.  Working Diagnosis: The patient's presentation and medical history is suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) exacerbated by hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity and a family history of vascular disease.
Coronary artery disease,5,35,Patient Presentation: Mr. James Peterson is a 67-year-old  African American male retired accountant who presents to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent chest discomfort. The patient reports that the chest discomfort generally occurs on exertion and is relieved by rest but has progressively been getting worse.  Heart diseases  including Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  are reported to be higher among African American males than other races. His age likewise falls within the higher risk category for CAD  which is most common among people aged 65 and older.  Past Medical History: Mr. Peterson has a history of hypertension and Hyperlipidemia which are both known significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. He also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia have been well-controlled with medication  though his diabetes management has been suboptimal  with a last HbA1C recording at 8.4%. The patient has no known allergies. His father died at the age of 58 from a myocardial infarction.  Presentation: The patient describes the chest discomfort as a squeezing sensation associated with shortness of breath and occasionally radiating to his left shoulder. He observes it mainly while climbing stairs or carrying heavy groceries. Additionally  his wife mentioned that he has been experiencing episodes of increasing fatigue and occasionally  mild dizziness over the past few weeks.  Social History: The patient is married with 2 adult children. He quit smoking 15 years ago but had a 20-pack year history prior to that. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. His diet is relatively high in fats and carbohydrates. His physical activity is minimal  as he enjoys reading and watching television.  The combination of Mr. Peterson's age  race  personal medical history  family history and presentation increases his risk and suggests a diagnosis of CAD. Further evaluation with a stress test or coronary angiography is warranted to confirm the diagnosis. His current chest discomfort suggests the possibility of unstable angina which requires immediate management. He would also benefit from better management of his diabetes  a review of his diet  and an increase in physical activity to reduce cardiovascular risk.
Coronary artery disease,5,36,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jackson  a 65-year-old African-American male with a medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and a 30 pack-year smoking history  presents to the clinic complaining of episodic chest pain for the past 2 months.   He describes the pain as heavy and pressurizing  usually located near the midst of his sternum. He notes that the episodes often occur during physical activities (e.g.  walking to the store or climbing stairs)  but the pain goes away after he rests for several minutes. Unfortunately  he is starting to notice that the pain is beginning to occur with less activity and sometimes even at rest.  In the last week  he reports experiencing some episodes of shortness of breath and diaphoresis with the chest pain. He's been feeling unusually fatigued as well. He denies any recent fever  cough  or weight loss. He acknowledges that he has not been compliant with his medications for the past few months due to financial constraints.  His family medical history is significant for a brother who had a heart attack in his early 60s.   Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. This could be typical angina due to underlying coronary artery disease  considering the nature  pattern  and aggravating and relieving factors of his symptoms  in addition to his Unstable angina risk factors and family history. There is an urgent need for further evaluation including ECG  cardiac biomarkers  and likely coronary angiography.

From his symptoms  physical exam findings  and risk factors  Mr. Smith is likely to have Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).
Coronary artery disease,5,40,Patient Profile: Mr. Jacob is a 66-year-old African-American male   Presenting Problem: Mr. Jacob has been admitted with persistent chest pain on exertion that has been worsening over the past 4 weeks. The pain is described as central  squeezing in nature and is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. It is relieved with rest.   Medical History: He has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he is currently on Metformin and Lisinopril. His father died at age 60 due to myocardial infarction. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years.  Clinical Examination: Vital signs are stable  but physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on basal lung fields. Electrocardiogram reveals some nonspecific changes. Lab tests show elevated cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.  Suspected Diagnosis: These findings are suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD)  likely secondary to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors  including a personal history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  smoking  and familial history of CAD. Further diagnostics including stress testing and potential coronary angiography might be necessary for confirming the diagnosis.   Plan: The patient will need lifestyle modifications  risk factor control  possibly pharmacotherapy  and possible revascularization (upon further diagnostic confirmation).
Coronary artery disease,5,41,Patient Profile:  A 66-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief complaints:  Chest pain that increases with physical activity and stress but decreases at rest  fatigue  shortness of breath  and episodes of lightheadedness.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a former smoker  having quit smoking 15 years ago after a 20-year habit. The patient consumes alcohol moderately and has a sedentary lifestyle. He is currently on medication for hypertension and diabetes.  Physical examination:  On presentation  the patient is mildly dyspneic. He has an elevated blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg and a BMI of 27. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular pulse rate of 85 bpm. Nail beds show mild cyanosis. Heart sounds are slightly muffled with a faint systolic murmur.  Relevant Diagnostic tests: EKG shows minor ST depressions. Lab results indicate elevated blood cholesterol levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.5%  confirming suboptimal diabetes control.  This case is in line with numerous studies demonstrating that coronary artery disease predominantly affects males and individuals aged over 65 years  as well as those with hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and diabetes. The presence of these comorbidities increases the patient's risk of cardiovascular complications. Smoking and consuming alcohol can also contribute to the onset of coronary artery disease. The patient's initial presentation with chest pain  fatigue  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness are typical symptoms of coronary artery disease.

Coronary artery disease,5,64,Patient is a 68-year-old African-American male  who presents with a several-month history of exertional chest discomfort  shortness of breath  increasing episodes of fatigue  and intermittent dizziness. Patient has a relevant medical past including a long-standing history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  obesity (BMI of 32)  and a 30-year pack history of smoking but ceased 2 years ago. Family history is significant for his father who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. Patient is currently taking metformin and losartan  but admits non-compliance due to lack of understanding of the medications' importance. On presentation  the physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure and a body mass index suggestive of obesity. EKG changes suggestive of ischemia. No other immediate abnormal findings. The patient's symptoms  lifestyle and previous medical history contribute to his high-risk status for coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,5,65,Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old Caucasian man  presents with typical angina-like symptoms. He is from middle-class socioeconomic status  living an urban lifestyle  and is retired. He has a significant past medical history including hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  all of which are currently being medically managed.   Current Presentation: He describes a central chest discomfort that radiates to his left arm and is associated with excessive sweating. These symptoms occur mainly during activities such as gardening or brisk walking and relieve with rest. Over the past week  these episodes have been growing more intense and frequent. The patient also reports mild dyspnea on exertion.   He is a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago  attributing to roughly 25-pack year history. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle  consuming a carb-heavy diet and a moderate alcohol intake. There is no relevant family medical history except for a younger brother who had an myocardial infraction in his early fifties.   The combination of Mr. Johnson’s demographics  previous medical history  and symptoms strongly suggest he is dealing with worsening coronary artery disease. The increase in severity and frequency in his angina symptoms suggest he may be at a stable but high risk  nearing unstable angina levels.
Coronary artery disease,5,66,Patient Profile:   Mr. Brown is a 58-year-old African-American male  presenting with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD).   Medical History:  He has a significant medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. His mother was diagnosed with CAD at the age of 64. For the past 15 years  Mr. Brown has been a heavy smoker with an average habit of 20 cigarettes per day.

He also reports episodes of shortness of breath following exertion  such as climbing stairs or walking a few blocks. He denies palpitations  syncope  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.   Given his medical history  risk factors(as diabetes  hypertension  smoking  obesity)  and presenting symptoms  Mr. Miller is suspected to have coronary artery disease  and further investigations are warranted. His age  ethnicity  and gender are also considered risk factors  as African American men have a higher risk for developing coronary artery disease in their 60s and 70s."
Coronary artery disease,5,85,Patient Information: A 64-year-old African American male  known smoker with a 20 pack-year history.  Chief Complaint: Recurrent chest discomfort especially during physical activity over the past month  along with occasional bouts of shortness of breath.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports that the chest pain initially occurred around a month ago  which he attributed to indigestion. The pain  described as dull  tight  and occurring in the center of his chest  has gradually increased in frequency and severity with physical exertion  particularly walking up an incline or lifting heavy objects. Occasionally  it radiates to his left arm and is associated with shortness of breath. Each episode usually subsides within 5-10 minutes of rest. Symptoms seemed to be somewhat relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin that his brother  a known heart patient  offered him.   Past Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril) and type 2 diabetes managed with diet and Metformin. No prior history of angina  myocardial infarction  stroke  or peripheral artery disease. No known drug allergies.  Family History: Both his father and older brother had premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in their 50s. His mother passed away due to complications from type 2 diabetes.  Social History: The patient is a retired truck driver  smokes 1 pack/day for the past 40 years  occasionally drinks alcohol  does not exercise regularly.   Review of Systems: Negative for fever  cough  palpitations  syncope  lower extremity swelling  and changes in bowel or bladder habits.   Physical Exam: Vital signs are within normal limits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Abdomen is soft  non-tender. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Based on the above  the patient's clinical presentation is consistent with stable angina  underlining the possibility of CAD which is common and severe in the African American population. Further diagnostic confirmation is required to develop an appropriate management plan.
Coronary artery disease,5,86,Patient Information: A 63-year-old Caucasian male  Medical History: The patient  a retired mechanic  has a notable history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  along with a 30-year history of moderate-to-heavy cigarette smoking. There is a family history of early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD)  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at 55.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a several-week history of progressive chest discomfort experienced primarily upon exertion  which has begun to interfere with his day-to-day activities. The chest pain is characterized as a gripping discomfort  radiating to his left arm and neck  and typically lasts for about 10 minutes  subsiding with rest. It is occasionally associated with shortness of breath  sweating  and nausea. Additionally  he reports increased fatigue and episodes of lightheadedness over the past month. He denies any symptoms of orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or leg swelling.  Interpretation: Given the patient's age  sex  significant past medical history  longstanding smoking habit  family history and presenting symptoms  the primary concern is stable angina pectoris secondary to likely coronary artery disease. Further diagnostic evaluation including ECG stress testing or coronary angiography is needed to confirm diagnosis and assess severity.   It's noteworthy that CAD is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is more common among males  and age is a significant risk factor with prevalence increasing significantly after the age of 60. History of dyslipidemia  hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and a positive family history of premature CAD are well-known risk factors. Classic clinical presentation is exertional chest pain (angina)  which can be associated with additional symptoms like dyspnea  perspiration  lightheadedness  syncope  or fatigue.
Coronary artery disease,5,87,Patient Problem Representation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents with gradually worsening exertional chest pain for the past eight weeks  especially after heavy meals. Accompanied symptoms include shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional dizziness. Current comorbidities include hypertension and dyslipidemia  for which he has been on diet control and oral antihypertensives for the past 15 years. Patient has a history of smoking 1 pack/day for 20 years  but quit 10 years ago. His BMI is 28  and he leads a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. His father had myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  On examination  the patient is afebrile with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  pulse 82 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 14 per minute. No edema in the lower extremities. Cardiac auscultation notes regular rhythm and rate without any murmurs or added sounds. His EKG shows T wave inversions in leads II  III  and aVF. His labs report elevated levels of cholesterol  LDL  and triglycerides; however  blood glucose levels are within the normal range. He is diagnosed with coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,5,88,Patient Profile: A 67-year-old African American male  Mr. J  living in an urban setting.  Relevant Medical History: The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  with poor medication adherence overall. He quit smoking cigarettes 5 years ago but he had a 30-pack year history prior to cessation. He also has dyslipidemia. He has a family history of early onset cardiovascular disease; his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 58.  Clinical Presentation:  Over the past four months  Mr. J developed progressive exertional chest discomfort that radiated to his left arm. Initially  the chest discomfort occurred while carrying grocery bags up two flights of stairs to his apartment  but more recently  it occurred while walking on level ground for about two city blocks. The chest discomfort is relieved by resting for about 5 minutes. In the past week  he also experienced diaphoresis and dyspnea coinciding with the episode of chest pain. He has no reported symptoms of syncope  palpitations  or lower extremity edema. His BMI is 32  and his blood pressure is consistently ranging 140-150/90-100 mmHg.  These recurrent episodes of chest pain associated with exertion and relieved by rest  lasting more than a few minutes  strongly suggest stable angina due to coronary artery disease. Associated symptoms of diaphoresis and dyspnea raise suspicion of a turbulent flow or ischemia  and his overall risk is elevated due to non-compliance to antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. Further diagnostic testing is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide the intervention.
Coronary artery disease,5,89,"Problem Representation:  A 63-year-old male with a history of smoking and hypertension reports to the emergency department with an escalating onset of chest pain over the past 24 hours. The patient describes the pain as """"squeezing"""" in nature  located in the center of the chest  radiating to the left arm. This episode was precipitated by moderate exertion and unsuccessfully relieved with rest  escalating over time. The patient also reports associated symptoms of dyspnea  diaphoresis  nausea  and a fainting spell. He denies any changes in bowel or bladder habits  recent weight loss  or fever. Family history is relevant for a father who died of a heart attack at age 58. On physical exam  the patient is diaphoretic and displays signs of distress  with vital signs showing blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate 88 beats/min  and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min.  The given symptoms and medical history suggest the patient is having an acute myocardial infarction secondary to chronic coronary artery disease. Immediate medical intervention is required to confirm diagnosis and treatment plan  which may include medications  lifestyle modifications  and possibly surgical interventions."

Coronary artery disease,6,5,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: - Age: 65 years - Gender: Male  - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Salesman. Sedentary lifestyle. - Residence: Urban area  United States - Marital Status: Married   Social History: - Tobacco use: A smoker for the past 40 years (20 cigarettes/day) - Alcohol: Moderate drinker (5-6 glasses of wine/week) - Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical exercise. - Diet: Predominance of processed foods  high in sodium and saturated fats.  Family History: - Father passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 64.  - Mother with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  - Brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease at age 60.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. On treatment but with irregular follow-ups. - Diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus -5 years ago. Poorly managed with oral antidiabetics. - History of high cholesterol diagnosed 8 years ago. Not on regular medication.  Relevant Medications: - Antihypertensive medication: Lisinopril - Oral antidiabetic medication: Metformin - Statin: Stopped taking it due to muscle discomfort 3 years ago.  Presenting Complaint: - The patient presents with complaints of exertional chest pain that radiates to the left arm. The pain usually lasts 3-5 minutes and alleviates upon rest. He also experiences shortness of breath during these episodes. The symptoms have been gradually increasing over the last three months.   Analysis: This patient belongs to a high-risk demographic group for coronary artery disease  given his age  sex  ethnicity  and sedentary lifestyle. He has multiple modifiable risk factors including tobacco and alcohol use  poor diet  and lack of physical activity. His past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and high cholesterol further increase his risk. His family history of cardiovascular diseases predisposes him to the risk of CAD. His current complaints are suggestive of typical angina pectoris  which indicates underlying coronary artery disease.  Based on this problem representation  a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation including cardiac biomarkers  ECG and potential coronary angiography will be needed. A case management plan will need to be drawn up including diet and lifestyle modifications  cessation of smoking and alcohol  regular physical exercise  and optimization of current medical therapy.
Coronary artery disease,6,6,Patient Problem Representation:  Personal Details: A 62-year-old African American male  employed as a full-time manufacturing worker  hailing from a middle-class  urban background  living with his wife.  Presenting Complaint: Attended the clinic for a regular check-up and complained about constant chest pain which tends to radiate to left arm and jaw  associated with episodes of shortness of breath and excessive sweating  particularly during physical activity  over the past 6-8 months.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension (diagnosed at age 55) and Type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at the age of 57)  both are moderately controlled with medication. He has also suffered from high cholesterol levels for five years.  Social History: He admits to have been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years and moderately uses alcohol. His diet tends to be high in saturated fats and low in fiber. He is physically inactive  primarily due to the nature of his work and limited recreational activity.  Family History: His father died of heart attack at the age of 65 and his older brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at the age of 59.  Current Medications: Atenolol 50 mg once daily for hypertension  Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes  and Atorvastatin 20 mg at nighttime for high cholesterol levels.  Problem Summary: Given the patient's age  race  gender  personal habits  and family history  along with his long-standing battle with hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol levels  all of which are known risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD)  his presenting complaints strongly suggest the possibility of CAD.  Plan: Further evaluation with electrocardiogram reading  blood tests for heart muscle damage enzymes  and stress testing is planned to confirm diagnosis. Pending confirmation  management will include lifestyle modification counseling (including smoking and alcohol cessation  diet change  exercise incorporation)  optimization of current medication  and discussion on the introduction of antiplatelet therapy. Cardiology consultation can be considered for potential coronary angiography depending on the severity of the disease.  This clinical scenario is reflective of the current demographic trends of CAD  where African American males  particularly those in their sixth decade of life  are at higher risk for CAD particularly those with smoking habits  unmanaged diabetes  hypertension  and unhealthy diet routines. The patient's occupation additionally suggests socioeconomic factors which may further contribute to his risk profile.
Coronary artery disease,6,7,Patient Representation:  1. Demographic Information:  - Age: Approximately 65 years old  as incidence and mortality rates for coronary artery disease (CAD) increase significantly with age. - Gender: Male  since men are generally at a higher risk for coronary artery disease than women in the same age group. - Ethnicity: White  as Caucasian men are at a higher risk than other ethnicities according to some studies. However  CAD affects all ethnicities. - Socioeconomic Status: Lower-middle income  as persons of lower socioeconomic status are at a greater risk. - Occupation: Retired from a sedentary desk job  as physically inactive occupations can contribute to risk. - Geographic Location: Urban dwelling can contribute due to greater exposure to environmental pollutants  stress  fast-food  and sedentary lifestyles.  2. Relevant Past Medical History:   - Family history of CAD: A significant genetic predisposition is present in coronary artery disease. - History of smoking: Smoking is a significant risk factor for CAD. Our represented patient is a former smoker. - Hypertension: A patient with a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure poses an elevated risk for developing CAD.  - Diabetes: This patient has Type 2 diabetes  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. Diabetes mellitus significantly increases the risk of CAD. - Hyperlipidemia: This is another condition significantly linked to plaque formation  narrowing arteries  a central problem in CAD. The patient uses a statin. - Overweight/obesity: Body mass index of 30  indicating obesity. - Previous myocardial infarction (heart attack): This is a direct sign of existing heart disease. - Moderate Alcohol consumption: While moderate alcohol consumption can provide a protective effect  increased levels can increase risk.  3. Lifestyle factors:   - Sedentary lifestyle: The patient has a low activity level which contributes to obesity and poor cardiovascular health. - Diet: His diet is rich in saturated fats  red meat  and processed foods while lacking in fruits  vegetables  and whole grains.  4. Clinical signs and symptoms:  - Chest discomfort: Patient experiences chest pain (angina) which worsens with exertion and resolves with rest. - Shortness of breath: The patient often becomes breathless during minimal physical activity  which is a typical symptom of CAD. - Fatigue: The patient is always tired  a consequence of a less efficient  diseased heart.    This patient representation shows common demographics  risk factors  and clinical presentation of a patient with coronary artery disease. Every patient will have unique factors influencing their disease  but often they will have several factors listed here. Screening and managing these risks is key to prevent CAD progression.

Patient X is a current smoker for 42 years  with a pack of 20 cigarettes daily. He is categorized as overweight with a BMI of 28 kg/m2. He has a moderate consumption of alcohol at 3 to 4 times a week.   Medical History: Patient X has a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). His father died at the age of 60 from myocardial infarction  and his older brother underwent a coronary stent placement at 63. The patient also suffered from hypertension (HTN) for the last ten years under medication with Lisinopril (10mg daily). Although his blood pressure is fairly controlled  usually averaging at 135/85mmHg  his lifestyle modifications are considered inadequate. About five years ago  he was also diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus and is on Metformin (500mg twice daily). His most recent HbA1c level remains high at 8.2%.   Symptomatology: Over the past few weeks  Patient X has reported increasing episodes of chest discomfort  primarily during exertion (like climbing stairs or walking uphill)  which relieved at rest. The pain was described as 'pressure-like' and located in the center of his chest. He also reported occasional dyspnea on moderate exertion. No symptoms of dizziness  syncope  orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea were reported.  Given the patient profile  multiple risk factors for CAD are present  including direct family history  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  current age  male sex  hypertension  Type II diabetes mellitus  and obesity. The symptomatic nature and pattern point towards stable angina pectoris  a clinical syndrome under the CAD spectrum. A comprehensive clinical assessment involving laboratory workup  functional testing  and potential cardiac imaging are warranted for a definitive diagnosis and proper management of the condition.   Note:  This problem representation is based on literature. Statistics show men are more likely than women to get coronary artery disease  and it tends to occur earlier in life for men. The prevalence of CAD increases with age. Smoking  hypertension  Type II Diabetes  and obesity are all major risk factors according to the American Heart Association.

Coronary artery disease,6,31,Problem representation:  Patient Profile: John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  living in an urban midwestern setting in the United States with his wife. He has had difficulty adhering to a strict diet and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Problem: He presents with chest pain of two weeks duration. He describes the chest pain as heavy  in the middle of his chest  sometimes radiating to his left arm and occasionally associated with shortness of breath. The pain usually occurs after walking for a block  forcing him to stop and rest. The pain subsides with rest within a few minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerin.   Past Medical History: John has a history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. He has been on medication (Lisinopril 10 mg once daily) but reports inconsistent compliance. John's father had experienced a myocardial infarction at age 64  and his mother suffered from type 2 diabetes. He is a former smoker  with a 20-pack year history  but he quit smoking 10 years ago.  Diabetes Screening: He underwent a routine medical check-up one year ago which revealed a marginally raised fasting blood glucose level. His HbA1c level was found to be 6.3%  a threshold value indicative of prediabetes.  Lipid Profile: His lipid profile reveals elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels for which he takes 20 mg of atorvastatin daily but with poor compliance.   The above details point towards the possible diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.  Relevant Literature: Studies indicate that coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in older adults  especially among males. Risk factors for CAD include hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  diabetes  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and family history of coronary artery disease. Reported rates of CAD are higher among the white population than among other ethnic groups (Fihn et al.  2012).    Daily Life: His daily activities have been increasingly impacted by the aforementioned symptoms  with him now avoiding any physical exertion.
Coronary artery disease,6,32,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 62 years old Sex: Gender assigned at birth: Male Occupation: Retired Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Country of Residence: United States BMI: 29 (Overweight) Marital Status: Married Annual income: 50k USD Education: High School diploma  Medical History:  - Diagnosed with hypertension at age 52 and has been taking ACE inhibitors ever since. - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 58  maintained with diet and Metformin. - Has a history of hypercholesterolemia  treated with Statins. - Patient is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago. - Has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. - Admitted to the emergency department two years ago with chest pain  which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery (RCA). - Patient consumes alcohol socially  5-6 standard drinks per week. - Family history of cardiac diseases - father suffered from a heart attack at 65. - Regular check-ups reflect poorly controlled blood sugar levels and blood pressure.  Current Presentation:  John Doe presented to the cardiology clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain which radiates to his left shoulder. The pain is generally precipitated by exertion such as climbing stairs or walking quickly and is relieved by rest. Recently he has noticed that he has become more easily fatigued. He has also noticed an increase in shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. He denies any symptoms of palpitations  syncope  or edema.  Clinical Measures: Blood Pressure: 150/90 mmHg  Resting Heart Rate: 87 bpm HbA1c: 8.2% Cholesterol Levels:    Total: 220 mg/dL   LDL: 160 mg/dL   HDL: 40 mg/dL   Triglycerides: 170 mg/dL  This patient's overall profile fits with the literature in terms of being at a higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Age  male gender  diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  and family history are all risk factors for CAD. According to the American Heart Association  almost 70% of people with diabetes  aged 65 or older  die from some form of heart disease. Similarly  two-thirds of the global population above the age of 60  experience symptoms related to CAD.

The patient's father and brother's past history of coronary artery disease also places this individual at a higher risk.
Coronary artery disease,6,34,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Sex: Male - Age: 65 years old - Occupation: Retired engineer - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Region: Northeastern United States - Marital Status: Married  Presenting Complaints:  - Patient reported a history of consistent chest pain  especially after physical activities and emotional stress  occurring over the last few months. - Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasionally light-headedness. - Mr. Doe describes the pain as being moderate to severe  """"like a heavy weight on my chest """" centralized in the area around his sternum.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension diagnosed at age 55; patient is generally responsive to first-line antihypertensive medications. - Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 60; glucose levels are moderately controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. - Former smoker  having quit 5 years ago but with a past smoking history of 20 pack-years. - Family history of coronary artery disease (father underwent coronary artery bypass grafting operation at the age of 65.) - No history of any major surgeries or procedures. - Not previously diagnosed with any mental health conditions. - Regularly takes aspirin and statin drugs for cardioprotection.  Lifestyle Factors:  - Mr. Doe's diet is moderately high in fats  cholesterol  and sodium. - Inactive lifestyle  with minimal engagement in exercise or physical activities. - Denies alcohol and any other substance abuse. - Sleeps approximately 6 to 7 hours per night  self-reports as """"adequate"""".  Current Assessment:  The patient’s age  sex  hypertensive state  past smoking history  and family history present a high coronary artery disease risk. Furthermore  his sedentary lifestyle  diet  type 2 diabetes management  and presenting symptoms show a high likelihood of coronary artery disease.  Rationale:  Recent data shows men  particularly those over 60  have higher incidences of coronary artery disease. Hypertension  diabetes  and former smoking status also increase his risk. Unfortunately  despite these elevated risk factors  incidences of coronary artery disease continue to be high in the northeastern U.S. region  explained possibly by the dietary and lifestyle habits commonly found in this region."

Family history of CAD  Social History: Patient reported being a smoker and says he consumes alcohol socially  has a high intake of fat and sugar in daily diet. Lack of physical activity  and exposure to constant work-related stress.    This patient representation is consistent with the literature's patient demographic for coronary artery disease. Men  particularly those of Caucasian descent  in their mid to late 50s  who have a sedentary lifestyle  smoke  and who have a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and diabetes are at a higher risk."
Coronary artery disease,6,37,Problem Representation:  Patient Description:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with fatigue  difficulty in breathing  and chest pain radiating to the left arm. He reports an increase in exertional symptoms over the past month. The patient has a sedentary lifestyle with occasional binge drinking. He has no known drug allergies.   Demographics:  Name: Patient X Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Habit: Occasional alcohol consumption  Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago) Lifestyle: Sedentary Occupation: Retired corporate banker Living Situation: Lives with his wife in their own house  Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago. He has been on regular medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily) and his blood pressure has been relatively controlled.   2. Diabetes: The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. His HbA1c level is 7.2% and he manages his condition through oral medication (Metformin 500mg twice daily) and diet control.   3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago. He currently takes Atorvastatin 20mg at night.   4. Previous Myocardial Infarction: The patient experienced a myocardial infarction 4 years ago  managed with angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending artery.   5. Family History: Both his parents died from heart disease. His father had an untimely death at the age of 55 due to a heart attack and his mother passed away from congestive heart failure at the age of 78.  This representation correlates with literature which suggests that coronary artery disease (CAD) is more prevalent in older adults  males  and people with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. Other factors like a sedentary lifestyle  smoking  alcohol consumption  and a family history of heart disease also increase the risk of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,6,38,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: Caucasian male  65 years old  retired engineer  living in a suburban area  married with two adult children. - Lifestyle: Current smoker for the past 40 years.

Established coronary artery disease (CAD) 2. Risk factors: Hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  high cholesterol  and obesity 3. Lifestyle risk factors: former smoker  low physical activity  unhealthy diet  Representation of the problem:  A 65-year-old white male with a history of hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  high cholesterol  obesity  and past CABG surgery presents with chest discomfort on exertion  shortness of breath  and occasional palpitations. He is a former smoker  has a low level of physical activity  and maintains a diet high in fat and cholesterol. He has a positive family history of CAD. His current complaints and risk profile strongly suggest a probable exacerbation of his established CAD.   Plan:  Further diagnostic tests  including but not limited to electrocardiograms  stress tests  echocardiograms  and potentially coronary angiography  are warranted. His prescriptions will likely need reviewing and adjusting  and he may require additional intervention  such as angioplasty or further bypass surgery. Lifestyle modification to improve dietary habits and increase physical activity will be an integral part of his management plan. Regular follow-up assessments are also necessary to monitor progress and manage complications.   Notice: The representation of the problem differs according to the context and need of the clinicians and the healthcare system.

Along with chest pain  the patient has been feeling nauseous and lightheadedness for the past few weeks. 2. Physical Examination: High blood pressure (150/90 mmHg)  irregular pulse  crackles in lungs owing to potential congestive heart failure. Patient appears anxious and overweight.  This patient's profile represents a predominant demographic and health history that is associated with CAD. The overall representation is based on data that suggest men  particularly of older age and Caucasian ethnicity  with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  smoking  and sedentary lifestyle  are at a higher risk of developing CAD. It's important to note  however  that CAD can affect groups beyond this typical representation.
Coronary artery disease,6,42,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Male - Age: 65 years old - Race: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired  - Marital Status: Married - Smoking Status: Former smoker (quit 10 years ago) - Alcohol: Moderate drinker (2-3 times per week) - Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle  Chief Complaint:  - Presentation with chest pain radiating to left arm and jaw  especially during exertion or stress. Pain usually resolves with rest.   Medical History:  - Diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 2 years ago - Family history of coronary artery disease (Father had a myocardial infarction at age 70)  - Regular medications include a daily aspirin  metformin for diabetes  amlodipine for hypertension.  Social History:  - Lives with wife. Has two children who live out of state. - Diet is high in fats  and patient admits to not eating many fruits or vegetables. - Used to work as an accountant  now retired.  This problem representation is consistent with the literature showing that coronary artery disease is more common in males and individuals over the age of 45. It is particularly prevalent in patients with a family history of the disease  which may result from inherited genetic risk factors. Other major risk factors include hypertension  diabetes  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and a diet high in saturated fats. Previous studies also commonly report chief complaints of chest pain or discomfort occurring during physical activity or emotional stress  which can also radiate to the arms  neck  jaw  stomach  or back and tend to improve with rest or nitroglycerin.
Coronary artery disease,6,43,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68 Year old Caucasian Male who presents with a chief complaint of exertional angina pectoris.  Demographics: The patient is a retired engineer who lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol moderately and does not have any known allergies. There has been a recent onset of dyspnea (shortness of breath) and anginal pain that are indicative of increased cardiac workload. Prior to his symptoms  he lived a fairly sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History: His past medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia  both of which are being managed with medication prescribed by his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 5 years ago  which is fairly controlled with Metformin. His BMI is 29.7 and he has been advised by his healthcare provider to aim for weight loss. His paternal grandfather died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his father suffered from angina pectoris.  Medications: The patient is currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily (for hypertension)  Lipitor 40mg daily (for dyslipidemia) and Metformin 500mg two times a day (for diabetes).   Review of Systems: The review of systems is positive for chest pain  shortness of breath  fatigue  decreased exercise tolerance and occasional dizziness. His angina is aggravated by physical exertion and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  BP is 150/90 mmHg and pulse is 80 bpm. General physical examination demonstrated obese physique with increased waist circumference. Cardiovascular examination showed normal heart sounds with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram reveals ST-T changes suggestive of ischemia  and 2D Echocardiograph suggests left ventricular hypertrophy.   Problem Representation: A 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia and Type II Diabetes presents with exertional angina  indicating probable Coronary Artery Disease  requiring further investigation  management of modifiable risk factors and potentially invasive therapy. Given his demographic and medical history  this depiction aligns with current literature which identifies advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity  and family history as risk factors for coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,44,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: Male  63 years old  Caucasian ethnicity  married  retired engineer residing in an urban area in the United States. - Family History: Father had heart disease and died at the age of 67  mother is alive at 87 with hypertension. He has an older brother who had a stroke at the age of 65 and a younger sister  who was recently diagnosed with diabetes at 58. - Social History: Moderate alcohol intake (red wine with dinner most evenings)  quit smoking 10 years ago after a 20-year history of 1 pack/day  sedentary lifestyle primarily because his occupation as an engineer required extended periods of desk work. His diet is relatively high in saturated fats and cholesterol  and consumption of fruits and vegetables is low.  Clinical History:  - Present Medical History: The patient has been feeling increasingly tired over the past few months with a pressure-like chest pain during exertion that is relieved by rest. The pain occasionally extends to his left shoulder and down his left arm. He is awakened by similar chest pains late at night. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating during these episodes. He also suffers from occasional episodes of heartburn  blaming it on his gastroesophageal reflux disease. - Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 50 which has been irregularly controlled with medication. His LDL cholesterol levels have been gradually rising over the years despite diet and lifestyle modifications. - Currently on medications: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg daily for hypertension  Atorvastatin 40mg every night for his high cholesterol  and ranitidine for his heartburn. - Findings: Blood pressure was found to be 145 / 90 mm Hg despite the hypertensive medication. His BMI is 28 kg/m^2 classifying him as overweight. His lipid profile shows an increased LDL level (170 mg/dL) and decreased HDL level (35 mg/dL)  both of which are advancing risk of heart diseases. - Psychosocial Background: The patient retired a year ago and since then  he has been feeling stressed due to a lack of purpose and concern over financial security. He denies any feelings of depression or anxiety but admits to having insomnia.  Summary: The patient is a 63-year-old male with a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol  a sedentary lifestyle and a family history of heart disease  stroke and diabetes. These factors increase his risk of having coronary artery disease (CAD). This is further supported by his symptoms of chest pain during exertion  nausea  and sweating. However  further evaluation is required to confirm the diagnosis of CAD.

Coronary artery disease,6,46,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 62 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Desk job - Location: Urban setting  Medical History: - Presenting with: Classic angina symptoms  including chest pain during exertion  left arm heaviness and shortness of breath - Patient has a history of hypertension diagnosed 8 years ago currently managed with antihypertensives - The patient is a smoker  averaging one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. - Patient has high cholesterol  known for 5 years  dyslipidemia managed with statins - The patient displays symptoms of obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 - There is a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient's father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. - Patient admits to a sedentary lifestyle with irregular physical exercise - Periodically experiences bouts of stress related to his work  has been diagnosed with mild anxiety - Has type 2 diabetes  diagnosed 4 years ago  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents - Moderate alcohol consumption  This patient has several risk factors for coronary artery disease  including a family history of the disease  a sedentary lifestyle  a smoking history  hypertension  dyslipidemia  type 2 diabetes  obesity and stress. His presenting symptoms  combined with these risk factors  suggest that he is experiencing coronary artery disease. Further diagnosis with ECG and coronary angiography will be carried out to confirm the suspicion. If diagnosed with CAD  a comprehensive management plan needs to be put in place which includes lifestyle modifications  pharmacotherapy and possibly revascularization procedures if suitable.  This problem representation might relate to a typical patient presenting with coronary artery disease  considering accurate demographic representation found in literature. Demographics such as age  gender  ethnicity; lifestyle factors such as occupation  location; and medical history could all contribute to the risk and progression of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,47,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe   Age: 65   Gender: Male   Race: White   Occupation: Retired Engineer   Marital Status: Married   Residence: Urban   Insurance: Medicare   Smoking History: Yes  quit 10 years ago   Alcohol Intake: Social Drinker (1-3 drinks per week)   Physical Activity: Low impact activity – walks in the park once a week   Diet: Uncontrolled  high in fats and calories   Presenting Complaint:   John Doe reports a recurring  distressing chest discomfort  particularly when engaging in physical activities. The discomfort subsides when he rests. He mentions feeling a heavy pressure  akin to squeezing  in the middle of his chest  which sometimes radiates to his shoulders and arms.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  uncontrolled high blood pressure. 2. Type-2 Diabetes: Diagnosed 10 years ago  poorly controlled blood sugar levels. 3. High Cholesterol: Diagnosed 10 years ago  taking statins inconsistently.  4. Previous acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) about 5 years ago.  5. Family History: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 70. Mother had a stroke at age 68.  Current Medication:  1. Lisinopril 20 mg once daily for hypertension. 2. Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type-2 diabetes. 3. Atorvastatin (20 mg) once daily for high cholesterol.  According to the literature  John Doe's profile is fitting of a typical coronary artery disease patient. His age  gender  race  past smoking habit  hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  sedentary lifestyle  and diet are all risk factors. His presenting complaint is characteristic of angina pectoris  which is common in patients with coronary artery disease. John's past medical history and family history further increase his risk of coronary artery disease. His previous myocardial infarction also suggests heart damage  which is a strong indicator of coronary artery disease. His medication list provides evidence of his long-term battle with chronic conditions associated with coronary artery disease.

Coronary artery disease,6,56,Patient Profile: Name: Henry Smith Age: 62 Years old Gender: Male Race: White Marital Status: Married Occupation: Retired Engineer Living Situation: Living with his wife Location: Urban  Problem Statement: Patient presents with symptoms indicative of coronary artery disease.   Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which has been managed with medication and self-care over the past 10 years. His hypertension is currently poorly managed as revealed by his recent blood pressure reading of 150/90 mm Hg. The patient also has high cholesterol levels and is prescribed statins. He is a former smoker  quit 15 years ago.  Patient's father died in his early 60s from a heart attack and his older brother  65 years of age currently has coronary artery disease (CAD).   The patient also admits he does not exercise regularly and has a high-salt  high-fat diet.   Physical Exam: The patient appears to be overweight with a BMI of 29. He also presents with shortness of breath upon minor exertion and occasional chest pain that appears to radiate to his left arm and jaw. He also reports feelings of fatigue.  Clinical Investigations: An electrocardiogram (ECG) test was conducted that indicated potential abnormalities associated with CAD. Further tests including coronary angiography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.  In summary  a 62-year-old male with a family history of coronary artery disease  personal history of hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and suspected angina symptoms with abnormal ECG results is highly likely to be suffering from CAD. His lifestyle factors such as diet  lack of exercise  being overweight  and residing in an urban environment may contribute to his condition. Further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.   References: 1. Benjamin EJ  Muntner P  Alonso A  Bittencourt MS  Callaway CW  et al.

Coronary artery disease,6,57,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired  smoker with a body mass index (BMI) of 30  presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. Ethnically similar to 88% of coronary artery disease patients in the United States as per the literature. Lives in an urban setting  is married and high stress levels.   Relevant Medical History: Patient has a known history of hypertension for the past ten years  managed with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Additionally  he has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 8 years and managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. Administration of sublingual nitroglycerin has provided temporary relief from the chest pain in the past.   Family History: Patient has a significant family history  with both parents suffering from coronary artery disease. His father had myocardial infarction at age 68 and mother had angina pectoris.   Lifestyle and Behavior: Patient is a chronic smoker with 40 pack-years  is sedentary and tends towards a diet high in saturated fat. He has high job-related stress as he was a manager in a corporate firm before his retirement.  Currently  the patient experiences worsening episodes of chest pain mostly on exertion  relieved by rest  and breathlessness for the last 6 months. The chest pain is retrosternal  pressing in nature and radiates to his left arm and jaw. It is associated with diaphoresis and a sense of impending doom.   Physical Exam: On examination  Blood Pressure is 140/90 mmHg  Pulse is 88 bpm and irregular  respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute  body mass index is 30 indicating obesity. Cardiovascular examination shows soft S1 and an S4 gallop.    Thus  the patient presents with multiple risk factors such as older age  male gender  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  obesity and family history of CAD  symptomatic with angina on exertion  indicating a high probability of coronary artery disease.   The representation displays a typical presentation of a patient with coronary artery disease as per the current demographic trends. This patient is due for further diagnostic tests and possible intervention.
Coronary artery disease,6,58,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: - Age: 72 years - Gender: Male - Race: White  - Occupation: Retired Lawyer - Marital Status: Married  - Socioeconomic Status: Middle Class  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has been on medications for the control of blood pressure and blood sugar for about 10 years. There's also a family history of heart diseases  particularly his father who had suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. He is a former smoker  having quit smoking 8 years ago  but has a history of smoking 1 pack/day for about 40 years. He follows a diet which is high in fats and carbohydrates and has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 5 years ago.  Presenting Concerns: The patient is presenting with complaints of chest pain that is radiating to the left arm. He describes the pain as a heavy pressure and states it amplifies during exercising or doing any physically intensive work and alleviates at rest. The patient has also experienced episodes of breathlessness and light-headedness.  This case fits the classical presentation of an elderly  white male patient with coronary artery disease  as seen in medical literature. A combination of genetic predisposition (family history of heart disease)  long-term hypertension and type 2 diabetes  unhealthy diet  long-term smoking history  and lack of physical activity has increased his risk of developing coronary artery disease. The patient's symptoms of chest pain  especially upon exertion  shortness of breath  and episodes of dizziness are typical of coronary artery disease as well.

This profile representation takes into account typical demographic and clinical factors associated with coronary artery disease  including senior age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity  smoking  family history of heart disease  sedentary lifestyle  and unhealthy diet  as frequently reported in literature. Any change in these factors might imply a different risk score for developing or progressing coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,61,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe is a 64-year-old Caucasian male with body mass index (BMI) of 30  indicating a categorization in the category of obese. He works as a bank manager and has a history of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits  including high intake of saturated fats  sodium  and sugars. He admits to being a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history and consumes alcohol socially  averaging 2-3 drinks per week.  Medical History: Mr. Doe presents with a 5 year-history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus  both managed pharmacologically with antihypertensives and oral anti-diabetic agents respectively. There is a notable family history of premature coronary artery disease  with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 50.   Living Conditions and Social History: John lives with his wife in the city. He retired recently and is finding it hard to adapt to claimed 'stress-free' retired life. The patient reports he experienced increased levels of stress following the loss of his mother two years ago  further exacerbated more recently by the loss of his job.  Presenting Complaint and Associated Symptoms: He visited his primary care physician today due to persistent central chest pain that started a month ago. The pain is dull in character  exertional in nature  and relief upon rest  raising clinical suspicion for stable angina pectoris. Occasionally  he also felt short of breath with minimal exertion. He reports experiencing episodes of dizziness  nausea but denies any fainting episodes  palpable heartbeats  or swelling in his legs.  Based on his demographic risk factors  clinical presentation  and medical and social history  there's a high suspicion of coronary artery disease. Further investigations including an electrocardiogram (ECG)  echocardiogram  stress test  and potential cardiac catheterization will be required to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.   References: The patient's profile is based on risk factors found in literature such as the AHA’s heart disease and stroke statistical update (2021)  indicating male sex  age over 45  Caucasian race  obesity  smoking  poor diet  hypertension  diabetes  and family history as significant risk factors for coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,62,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 65 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired white-collar job - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle  current smoker and increased alcohol intake  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with complaints of chest pain that is typically central and crushing  sometimes radiating to the left arm or neck. It's often accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  sweating  and dizziness. The symptoms usually get worse with physical activity or emotional stress.  Past Medical History: 1. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago. 2. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive for the last 12 years and is currently taking Antihypertensive medication. 3. Dyslipidemia: The patient has elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the past and currently on lipid-lowering medications. 4. Prior Cardiovascular Events: The patient had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents. 5. Family history: His father had cardiac disease and died of myocardial infarction at the age of 59 and his mother has Type 2 diabetes.  This profile is representative of a typical patient presenting with coronary artery disease based on multiple epidemiological studies. Such a patient is at high risk of repeated acute cardiac events and stands to benefit from aggressive management of his modifiable risk factors (smoking cessation  increased physical activity  dietary changes  etc.) along with optimal therapeutic interventions.
Coronary artery disease,6,63,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: White (Non-Hispanic) - Occupation: Works in a high-stress corporate job  sedentary  - Lifestyle: Smoker for 30 years  body mass index (BMI) of 28  indicating overweight. Consumes alcohol moderately  limited exercise  high fat diet. - Living Conditions: Lives in a suburban area with a wife and two adult children  family history of heart diseases.  Presenting Complaint: - Symptoms: Regular episodes of chest pain particularly during periods of activity (stable angina); the pain radiates to the left arm and jaw  lasts for few minutes and is relieved by rest. Patient also reports of exertional breathlessness and occasional palpitations. He also experienced episodes of sweating and nausea during the past week.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed and treated for the past 10 years  not always compliant with the treatment. - High cholesterol: Diagnosed 5 years ago but refused to take medication considering it unnecessary and has not maintained a diet that would lower cholesterol levels. - Previous heart attack: Suffered myocardial infarction (heart attack) 8 years ago  and attended cardiac rehabilitation program for a while. - Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Diagnosed 7 years ago  poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.  The patient's demographic profile aligns with literature showing that CAD predominantly affects older adults  with males being more susceptible than females  along with the risk factors such as smoking  overweight (high BMI)  high-fat diet  sedentary lifestyle  etc. The past medical history suggests poor control of risk factors like hypertensive  cholesterol  and diabetes  all of which escalated the risk of developing CAD. His family history of heart diseases also predisposes him to the condition. His occupation and lifestyle choices put him under chronic stress  which also contributes to CAD risk. Additionally  his symptoms of chest pain  breathlessness  and palpitation align with the typical presentation of CAD. Therefore  it is highly probable that this patient is a representative of a typical patient with coronary artery disease. However  for accurate diagnosis further evaluation is required including ECG  stress test  angiogram  etc.

Coronary artery disease,6,71,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Sex: Male - Age: 65 years old - Ethnicity: White - Occupation: Software Engineer - Resides: Urban setting  Presenting Symptoms:  Complains of intermittent chest pain especially upon exertion  shortness of breath  occasional bouts of fatigue  and some instances of heartburn-like symptoms. The patient also reports discomfort which is traveling into the arm  back  neck  and jaw during chest pain episodes.   Past Medical History:  - Long term cigarette smoker (30 pack-years) - Type II Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago - Hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago - High cholesterol level diagnosed 7 years ago - Paternal history of heart disease - Previous history of a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity - BMI of 30 signaling obesity  The patient has been a regular at taking antihypertensive  antidiabetic  and cholesterol-lowering medicines. The last checkup was six months ago and it was reported that levels were fairly controlled. He quit smoking two years ago after attending a cessation program  but his previous extensive history of smoking is a significant risk factor.   Assessment:  Given the demographic characteristics (older age  male)  past medical history (smoking  diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol)  family history  lifestyle factors (sedentary  obesity) and presenting symptoms (chest pain radiating to other areas  shortness of breath)  a provisional diagnosis of coronary artery disease is highly plausible.   This patient matches the typical profile of patients presenting with coronary artery disease as seen in epidemiological literature. Men  particularly those in older age groups and of white ethnicity  are at an increased risk. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol further add to this risk. The former smoking habit  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history also contribute as significant risk factors.
Coronary artery disease,6,72,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographic Information:      - Gender: Male     - Age: 65 years old     - Race: Caucasian     - Occupation: Retired office worker     - Place of Residence: Urban  - Relevant Past Medical History:      - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago       - High cholesterol for 5 years       - History of smoking pack-a-day for past 40 years but quit smoking for last 2 years.     - Family history of heart disease (father had a heart attack in his 60s)     - Sedentary lifestyle     - Mild obesity (Body Mass Index of 30)     - Type II diabetes diagnosed 3 years ago.  Presenting complaint:  The patient presents with a complaint of chest pain identified as stable angina since last month. He reports that the pain is severe and constricting in nature  usually noticed on exertion (like walking and climbing stairs)  and relieved by rest. The pain lasts for 10-15 minutes and radiates to his jaw and left arm.  Clinical Observations:  Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg Heart rate: 75 bpm Body Mass Index: 30  Lab Tests:  - Elevated LDL cholesterol: 150mg/dl (normal: less than 100mg/dl) - Elevated HbA1c: 8% (normal: less than 7% for patients with diabetes) - ECG: Possible signs of heart ischemia  The patient’s age  gender  history of hypertension  high cholesterol  diabetes  and family history  along with his presenting complaints and observations from the physical exam  all fall in line with typical presentations of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,73,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 65 years - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Marital Status: Married - BMI: 28 (overweight) - Smoking status: Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago) - Alcohol consumption: Moderate (2-3 glasses of wine per week) - Physical activity: Inactive (minimal physical activity)    Medical History: - Hypertension for 10 years  moderately controlled with medication - Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago  on insulin therapy  - Dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) for 5 years  poorly controlled - History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) 3 years ago - Family history of cardiovascular diseases (Father had a myocardial infarction at age 60)  Present Complaint: - Gradual onset of chest pain over the past 6 months  - Episodes of chest pain usually occur with physical exertion (like climbing stairs  brisk walking)  characterized as pressure in the center of the chest  radiating to left arm - Episodes last about 10-15 minutes  subsiding with rest or nitroglycerin medication  According to literature  CAD is more common in men than in women  particularly in younger age groups. The gender difference decreases but does not disappear with advancing age. Race affects the incidence of CAD  with certain races/ethnicities having higher or lower incidences. In this case  the patient is a Caucasian male  65 years old  which aligns with a typical demographic for CAD. Additionally  the patient has several risk factors which also increase the likelihood of CAD such as hypertension  dyslipidemia  type 2 diabetes  family history of heart disease  and a prior smoking habit.

Presenting Complaint:  Patient presents complaining of recurrent episodes of chest pain over the past few weeks. The pain is described as pressure-like  located in the center of the chest and radiating to the left arm. It typically lasts 10-30 minutes  and is associated with shortness of breath and sweating. The chest pain is provoked by physical exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Physical Examination:   1. Blood Pressure: 150/90 mmHg 2. Heart Rate: 80 beats/min 3. Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air 4. Body Mass Index: 30 (Obese)  The chest examination reveals normal breath sounds bilaterally and no abnormal heart sounds. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Laboratory Investigation:  Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates T-wave inversion in the inferior leads.  Based on the demographic and clinical information  the representation of the patient suggests a typical presentation for coronary artery disease. The patient's age  gender  ethnicity  lifestyle behaviors (smoking  sedentary lifestyle)  family history  personal medical history (hypertension  diabetes  obesity)  and the classic nature of his chest pain all contribute to a high likelihood of coronary artery disease. Next steps will typically include stress testing and possible coronary angiography.
Coronary artery disease,6,75,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 62 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer Marital status: Married Socio-economic status: Middle-class Residence: Urban area BMI: 25.5 Smoking: Non-smoker Alcohol: Occasional social drinker Physical activity: Minimal Diet: High fat  Low fiber diet  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 5 years ago  currently under control with antihypertensive medication. 2. Type 2 diabetes: Diagnosed 6 years ago  currently on oral hypoglycemic therapy. 3. Previous history of Acute Myocardial Infarction: Experienced a heart attack 3 years ago  underwent angioplasty. 4. Dyslipidemia (high cholesterol): Currently managed with statin therapy 5.

Coronary artery disease,6,76,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67 years old  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: White/Caucasian  Occupation: Retired engineer  Residence: Suburban  Middle-class Neighborhood  Marital Status: Married  Insurance Status: Medicare   Past Medical History: John has a history of hypertension  managed with prescription medications for the past 10 years. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  also managed with oral medications. He has a family history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  with his father having his first heart attack at age 55. John quit smoking 15 years ago and has a 30 pack-year history. He consumes alcohol moderately. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and is slightly overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.  Presenting Complaints: John presents with symptoms of angina  characterized by chest discomfort  occasional shortness of breath  especially during exertion  and a feeling of indigestion.  Reason for current evaluation: These symptoms have been increasing concerning John. Given the severity of the symptoms and the patient's past medical history and risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  family history  past smoker  and age)  there's a high likelihood of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Social History:  John is a retired engineer  lives with his wife. He has two children who live out-of-state. John and his wife lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle. They are non-vegetarian and admit that their diet could be healthier.  NOTE: Data suggests that coronary artery disease largely affects older adults  particularly males aged 60 to 79 years (with a median age of 65). Other factors such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and smoking also significantly increase the risk of CAD. Family history of the disease is another important consideration. Caucasians  particularly of northern European descent  have a historically higher risk  although the disease affects people of all ethnicities. Also  a correlation exists between CAD and socioeconomic status  with higher rates found among lower socioeconomic groups.

Metformin 1000mg - Twice daily (for diabetes)   BMI: 28.5 kg/m^2 - Overweight  This problem representation is patterned after the classic demographics for coronary artery disease  which is typically seen in males over the age of 65 with risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. Smoking and family history of heart disease are also common risk factors. The typical patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a diet high in fats.
Coronary artery disease,6,78,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 61 Race: Caucasian Occupational Status: Retired Socioeconomic Status: Middle Tobacco Use: Smoker for 40 years Alcohol Use: Moderate Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle  Medical History:  - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  currently under control with medication. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  currently well managed with metformin. - Previous history of high cholesterol levels  currently controlled with medication - Obesity (BMI: 31 KG/m2) - Family history of heart diseases: father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 62. - History of transient ischemic attack 2 years ago. - Underwent a stress test 1 year ago that showed normal results.  Current Complaints/Symptoms:  - Recently started experiencing chest pain  especially on exertion  - Shortness of breath  - Occasional episodes of dizziness  - Palpitations   This profile seeks to represent a typical patient with coronary artery disease  given that the average age of diagnosis in men is around 65 and in women  it's around 72. Many individuals with coronary artery disease have a history of smoking  high blood pressure (hypertension)  high cholesterol  obesity  diabetes  and a family history of heart disease  which are all significant risk factors for coronary artery diseases. The symptoms presented  such as chest pain on exertion  shortness of breath  dizziness  and palpitations are common presentations of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,6,79,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   - Sex: Male - Age: 57 years old  - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Professional/white collar job - Marital Status: Married - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical exercise; occasional smoker and regular alcohol consumer.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: The patient has been medically controlled hypertensive for about 6 years. - Dyslipidemia: The patient has been diagnosed with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of HDL cholesterol about 4 years ago. - Diabetes: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes for about 2 years. - Overweight: BMI of 28 indicating overweight status. - Family History: Patient's father experienced a heart attack at age 60 and mother has history of high blood pressure.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient has come with complaints of sporadic chest pains that he describes as heavy or squeezing  occurring mostly during physical exertion or stress. In recent weeks  the chest pain has been occurring more frequently and with less exertion  even at rest. Additionally  the patient reports feeling unexplained fatigue  shortness of breath  and occasional dizziness.  Given the patient's presenting symptoms  past medical history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes  combined with his lifestyle and family history  he may be at high risk for coronary artery disease. This is further supported by the demographic data indicating that males  particularly Caucasian males aged 45 and older  are more commonly affected by coronary artery disease. Furthermore  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  regular alcohol consumption  and excess weight are established risk factors for coronary artery disease.  It is important to further investigate these symptoms  which could be indicative of unstable angina  a precursor to myocardial infarction (heart attack) and perform appropriate diagnostic tests e.g.  electrocardiogram (ECG)  stress test  angiogram etc.

This demographic representation covers the typical patient presenting with coronary artery disease  taking into account factors like age  gender  race  personal habits  socioeconomic and family history. A significant proportion of coronary artery disease patients are males  aged 60 and above with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. The symptoms described are consistent with angina  a common sign of coronary artery disease. This representation provides an accurate and comprehensive picture to direct further investigation and intervention.
Coronary artery disease,6,91,Problem Representation for Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient Profile:  Patient X is a 65-year-old white male with weight of 235 pounds and height of six feet tall. He is a long-term smoker for the past 30 years  who consumes one pack of cigarettes per day. The patient is an executive at a multinational company  which calls for a sedentary lifestyle marked with high levels of stress  little physical activity  and irregular fat-rich diet. The patient has a familial history of coronary artery disease. His father passed away at the age of 55 due to a myocardial infarction. In addition  the patient consumes alcohol moderately  at a frequency of about twice a week.  Medical History:  Patient X was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which has been inconsistively regulated through medication. His current blood pressure is around 150/90 mm Hg. Around five years ago  he was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is currently regulated by Metformin.  Previous lab results have shown LDL cholesterol level in Patient X’s blood to be 160 mg/dL. The patient takes Atorvastatin for cholesterol regulation  however  medication compliance has been a reported challenge due to his busy schedule.  Current Presentation:  Patient X presents with a two-week history of intermittent chest pain  usually during times of stress or after eating heavy meals. He describes the pain as “pressure” and “tightness” that radiates to his left arm  often accompanied by shortness of breath. The intensity of the pain can vary  but it typically diminishes with rest. The patient reported similar chest pains around two months ago  but ignored these signs attributing them to indigestion or work stress.  Considering his demographic  behavioral  and medical history  along with his current symptoms  it can be inferred that the patient has a high risk of developing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He is in need of further diagnostic tests to evaluate and confirm the presence of CAD  and to take appropriate therapeutic steps based on the diagnosis.
Coronary artery disease,6,92,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   - Demographics: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired  with a high school level education. He is a former smoker  having quit 30 years ago. He has been regularly consuming alcohol but within moderate levels as recommended for men. He is married and lives with his wife  has two adult children  and three grandchildren.  - Past medical history: He has a history of hypertension for the last 10 years  managed with lifestyle modification and medication (ACE inhibitors). His father had a heart attack at age 68.  - Clinical Presentation: The patient has been experiencing intermittent chest discomfort over the past two months  especially during physical activities. The discomfort is described as a squeezing sensation  often going to his left arm  and it gets relieved with rest.   Relevant data:  - Blood pressure: 145/90 mmHg - Body mass index (BMI): 29  suggesting that he is overweight. - Blood cholesterol levels: Total cholesterol: 220 mg/dL  Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 160 mg/dL  High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: 45 mg/dL  Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL. - Fasting blood glucose: 110 mg/dL  suggesting pre-diabetes. - Electrocardiogram (ECG): Normal at rest  but stress test ECG shows ST-segment depression. - Echocardiography shows a normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities at rest. - Coronary angiography shows significant (70%) stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.  Impression:  Based on the demographic profile  clinical presentation and diagnostic findings  the patient has a high likelihood of having stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Discussion:  Our currently represented patient's demographic profile aligns with typical CAD patients as literature suggests that CAD is more common in old age  males  Caucasians  and those with a family history of heart diseases. Additionally  modifiable risk factors including hypertension  being overweight  high cholesterol levels  and pre-diabetes are also present in our patient  further increasing his propensity to develop CAD. His symptoms of exertional chest pain relieved by rest are suggestive of angina pectoris  a characteristic symptom of CAD. The significant stenosis observed in his LAD artery during coronary angiography further substantiates the diagnosis of CAD.

Presenting Complaint: The patient presents in the clinic with a complaint of persistent chest pain radiating to his left arm. He also reports having shortness of breath  fatigue  cold sweat  and lightheadedness. The chest pain is triggered by physical activity and relieved by rest.  Past Medical History: - Has been diagnosed and treated for high blood pressure five years ago. - Diagnosed as a type II diabetic three years ago  currently under oral hypoglycemic drugs. - Had episodes of transient ischemic attacks around four years ago.  - Confirmed case of high cholesterol and triglyceride.   This representation attempts to highlight common demographical and clinical factors associated with CAD. Age (>45 for men)  race (Caucasians have higher risk)  gender (men are generally at greater risk)  genetic predisposition  hypertension  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and diabetes are well-known risk factors for coronary artery disease. However  this is a simplified representation and actual patients can have more complexity and diversity. Plus  clinical presentation and history can vastly differ  and they require careful medical evaluation and interpretation.
Coronary artery disease,6,94,Problem Representation:   A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  known case of Type II Diabetes mellitus (Well-controlled on Metformin)  Systemic Hypertension (Stable on Lisinopril)  has presented for a regular follow-up. His BMI is recorded as 30  indicating obesity  and he has been a smoker for more than 40 years  with an average of 20 cigarettes a day. The patient's history includes Dyslipidemia for which he takes daily low-dose Atorvastatin. The family history reveals a significant predisposition to coronary artery disease (CAD)  as the patient's father passed away at the age of 70 due to a myocardial infarction  and his elder brother also has CAD.   The patient complains of experiencing chest discomfort on minimal physical exertion (Angina)  which is relieved upon rest. He has no history of a previous myocardial infarction  coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)  or Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). On examination  the patient's blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg and his resting heart rate is 85 beats per minute. Evidence of peripheral arterial disease was noted with diminished pulses in the lower extremities.   The patient has not been compliant with diet and exercise. His most recent lab results show an elevation of LDL cholesterol levels to 160 mg/dl and an HbA1c of 7.7%. No chronic kidney disease or Congestive Heart Failure in past medical history. The patient hasn't reported any bleeding or clotting disorders and there is no history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient also doesn't show signs of any cognitive impairment or mood disorders. This description fits the typical patient profile with coronary artery disease as reported in the literature.

The demographic information given here falls within the typical characteristics of CAD patients in the United States  wherein individuals over the age of 60 and of Caucasian ethnicity are at higher risk of developing the disease.  Patient Information: The patient is a retired financial analyst who lives with his wife. At 175cm tall and weighing 85kg  he falls within the overweight category with a Body Mass Index of 27.8. The patient has a history of tobacco use  with a smoking habit that lasted 40 years and continues to consume alcohol moderately.   Medical History: The patient has a notable history of elevated cholesterol and hypertension  both controlled with medication. The family history includes a father who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. The patient was previously treated for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and remains on oral hypoglycemic pharmacotherapy. He suffers from mild COPD  likely from his long-standing smoking history  and takes regular maintenance inhalers.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented with complaints of intermittent chest pain  shortness of breath exacerbated with exertion  and occasional episodes of palpitations which have persisted over a period of 4 months. Upon physical examination  the patient had an elevated blood pressure reading of 150/90mmHg. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs  and the lungs were clear on auscultation.   Diagnostic assessment: The initial 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia. The patient underwent an exercise stress test that demonstrated inducible ischemia. Blood panels showed elevated cholesterol and slightly elevated glucose levels  consistent with his known conditions. His cardiac enzymes were within normal range.  Treatment: Due to these findings and initial test results  an angiogram was recommended and performed. The angiography report revealed significant obstruction in his left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was commenced on aspirin  a beta-blocker  and a statin. Given that angiography revealed a significant lesion  the patient was referred to a cardiologist for further management  including potential stenting or surgical intervention.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of timely recognition  diagnosis  and management of CAD in those particularly at high risk due to age  lifestyle  comorbidities  and a significant family history.  The patient's comorbidity and lifestyle choices indicate a pressing need for health education and the importance of lifestyle changes  which include ceasing smoking  reducing alcohol intake  maintaining a balanced diet  achieving a healthy weight  and regular exercise.

Coronary artery disease,7,2,Title: A Case Report on a Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction:  This case report discusses a 57-year old African American male patient  Mr. X  currently residing in Houston  Texas  suffering from Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The report includes demographic information  a past medical history review  symptoms  diagnosis  treatment plan  and a follow-up.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X  an African American male aged 57  who works as a delivery truck driver  has been suffering from intermittent episodes of chest pain radiating to the left arm  especially during an intense session of physical activity. He smokes regularly and has a documented history of smoking for the past 35 years. He also reports having a genetic predisposition toward heart diseases  as both his father and brother were diagnosed with CAD. Mr. X married 30 years ago and has 2 children. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle  which primarily involves driving for several hours each day with little to no time for regular exercise.  Medical History:   Mr. X has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and controlled hypertension. He has been on metformin and Lisinopril for the past 10 years with poor compliance to medications and lifestyle modifications. He has no history of major surgeries. There is no known drug allergy. His last recorded BMI was 28.5  indicating overweight.  Investigation & Diagnosis:  He was advised to undergo a series of medical investigations given the family history and his clinical symptoms. Resting EKG showed slight ST-segment depression in the lateral leads. An exercise stress test was positive for ischemic changes. Coronary angiography confirmed significant disease in the left anterior descending artery (70% stenosis) and the right coronary artery (80% stenosis)  concluding he has CAD.   Treatment:  Based on angiography findings  Mr. X was recommended for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as the therapeutic procedure. Post-angioplasty  he was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel)  statins (Atorvastatin)  ACE Inhibitors (lisinopril)  and Metformin for T2DM. A comprehensive lifestyle alteration was also strongly encouraged  consisting of smoking cessation  a low-salt  low-fat diet  regular physical exercise  and strict medication adherence.   Discussion:  Race and ethnicity have been identified as high-risk factors  and African-American men have a higher prevalence of CAD  as mirrored in this patient profile. Familial predisposition  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and obesity have likely contributed to the disease development.  The aim of the treatment plan is to relieve symptoms  slow or stop disease progression  reduce future risk to the patient  and improve overall quality of life. The adherence of Mr. X to the statin therapy and lifestyle modification would be critical for achieved desired outcomes.  Follow-Up:  The patient is to be followed up monthly in the cardiology clinic for assessment of therapeutic response and possible side-effects. Smoking cessation would be monitored  as well as weight reduction  physical activity levels  and strict glucose control.  Conclusion:  This case was an example of a typical presentation of CAD in a male patient with multiple risk factors like T2DM  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and genetic predisposition. A combination of lifestyle modification and drug therapy can help manage the disease and promote longevity. Regular follow-up will be essential to the successful execution of this management plan.

These episodes often occur during periods of physical activity  like when carrying groceries or climbing stairs  and are usually resolved with short periods of rest.   In addition to chest pain  she also reports shortness of breath after minor exertion  general fatigue  and occasional events of diaphoresis.   Diagnosis:  Given her symptoms  age  racial background  sex  medical and family history  the patient was suspected of having coronary artery disease. This was confirmed with the help of an electrocardiogram and a stress test showing abnormal results indicative of CAD. Further  a coronary angiogram was conducted  revealing significant blockage in the three major coronary arteries.  In summary  this case refers to a 65-year-old overweight African American female with prior history of Type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and preeclampsia  who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient also has a family history of cardiovascular disorders. She has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease on the basis of clinical symptoms  ECG  stress test  and a coronary angiogram.  The risk factors involved in this case are quite typical for CAD as represented in the literature  with the inclusion of demographic factors (age  African racial background  and female sex)  lifestyle (BMI in the overweight category)  medical history (diabetes and hypertension)  and family history of heart disease.   The symptoms are classical of CAD  associated with physical exertion and resolved with rest. The fatigue  shortness of breath  and diaphoresis are associated symptoms that often accompany CAD. 
Coronary artery disease,7,9,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in an Elderly African American Male with a History of Hypertension  Introduction: This case report describes a 69-year-old African American male with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  presenting with progressive shortness of breath and frequent episodes of chest pain in exertion. The aim of this report is to discuss this frequent  yet multifaceted illness  emphasizing the importance of timely interventions  regular monitoring  and educating patients about risk factor modification.  Case Presentation: We present a case of Mr. L  a 69-year-old African American male  a retired construction worker  living in an urban environment. He arrived at the emergency department complaining of progressive shortness of breath and angina-related chest pain that got worse particularly during physical exertion. The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking 15 years ago  has a mild alcohol intake of a glass of wine every two days and leads a sedentary lifestyle. His family history is notable for heart disease with his father having suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 60.   Past Medical History:  Mr. L has a known history of hypertension for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II five years ago  but his blood glucose levels have been controlled with metformin. He presented with similar but mild symptoms a year ago  managing it with over the counter antacids assuming it was due to gastritis.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. L appeared anxious and dyspneic. His pulse rate was 89 beats per minute  and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal first and second heart sounds with no murmurs. Chest x-ray did not show any abnormalities. His Body Mass Index was 29.3  indicative of overweight.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Electrocardiogram showed ischemic changes including T wave inversion in the inferior leads. The high sensitivity troponin level was slightly elevated. His fasting blood glucose level was 132 mg/dL and the Hemoglobin A1c level was 7.1%  indicating that his diabetes was not well controlled. His lipid profile indicated high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.  Management:  Mr. L was immediately started on aspirin  statin therapy  sublingual nitroglycerin for the chest pain  and a beta-blocker to manage his hypertension and reduce the myocardial oxygen demand. Given his elevated troponin level and ECG changes  he was recommended for coronary angiography which revealed significant stenosis in his distal left anterior descending artery  and he underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement.  Discussion:  Given the patient's risk factors - including his age  ethnicity  family history of heart disease  hypertension  diabetes  sedentary lifestyle  overweight  and previous smoking behavior - his risk for CAD is high  illustrating the multifaceted nature of this disease. His case underscores the need for timely intervention  as well as providing diverse and nuanced care based on these factors. Regular monitoring and greater patient education regarding risk factor modification is a central component of CAD management.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the complexities of managing CAD in a patient exhibiting multiple risk factors. It underscores the importance of early recognition and management of modifiable risk factors. Furthermore  it emphasizes the significance of patient education in preventing disease progression and complications.
Coronary artery disease,7,10,Title: Case Report on Late-Onset Stable Coronary Artery Disease in a Female Patient  1. Introduction and Patient Information:  The patient  Mrs. Maria  is a 74-year-old Caucasian female presenting to the cardiology clinic with complaints of recurrent discomfort in her chest that radiates to her left arm. She has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and is a non-smoker. She lives with her husband and is retired. Prior to retirement  she worked as a teacher. She reports drinking alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use.  2. Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mrs. Maria appeared well-nourished and well-groomed but notably anxious about her symptoms. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated (155/92 mmHg)  pulse rate was regular around 72 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Her BMI was calculated to be 28  indicating overweight status. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable. Review of her lab findings revealed elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) but normal blood glucose level.   3. Timeline:  The timeline of Mrs. Maria’s symptoms began around five months ago. At first  she experienced the discomfort during physical activities like climbing stairs. In recent weeks  she reports the discomfort even while in rest. However  her pain lasts for a short period  typically a few minutes.  4. Diagnostic Assessment:  An EKG was performed  which revealed nonspecific ST segment changes. An exercise stress test was done that demonstrated downsloping ST-segment depression in the left precordial leads during the peak exercise  indicating potential ischemia. Following these findings  the patient was sent for coronary angiography which revealed significant occlusion in the left anterior descending artery.  5. Therapeutic Intervention:  Due to the significant occlusion  a decision was made to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. Mrs. Maria was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) along with a statin.  6. Outcome and Follow-up:  Shortly after the PCI  she reported an absence of her previous chest discomfort. At her 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments  she continues to be symptom-free. She was counseled on lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet  regular exercise  maintenance of a healthy weight  and strict blood pressure and cholesterol control.  7. Discussion:  Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is prevalent in the elderly population and is more common  severe  and extensive in men than in women. However  post-menopausal women  like Mrs. Maria  are at increased risk due to the loss of the protective effect of estrogen. This case highlights the importance of understanding the different presentations and management of CAD in the older female population. The successful outcome underlines the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in a high-risk individual such as Mrs. Maria.
Coronary artery disease,7,11,Title: Case Report - An Elderly Male with Coronary Artery Disease and a Complicated Past Medical History  Introduction:  Patient Profile: This is a case report of Mr. J  an 68-year-old Caucasian male  residing in urban America  with a long-standing history of coronary artery disease (CAD). His medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type II. These diagnoses are consistent with the highest CAD risk factors in this demographic  as widely acknowledged in medical literature.  Case Presentation:  Initial Presentation: Mr. J presented in the Emergency Department (ED) with severe  crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. Associated symptoms included shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and palpitations  which are typical presentations of unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction.  Medical History: His past medical history included two separate episodes of myocardial infarction (MI) occurring ten and five years ago  two percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with stenting  and one coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He has been prescribed medications like aspirin  metformin  amlodipine  and atorvastatin but has a poor compliance history.  Mr. J has been a smoker for 30 years and quit five years ago post the CABG. He has a BMI of 29  indicating obesity  and has a familial history of CAD. His lifestyle is sedentary with poor dietary habits including a high intake of processed food  low in vegetables and fruits.  Clinical Findings:  In the ED  Mr. J's EKG showed T-wave inversion in the anterior leads suggestive of myocardial ischemia  and cardiac biomarkers were elevated. His blood sugar level was 190 mg/dL  blood pressure was 170/95 mmHg  and LDL cholesterol was 160 mg/dl. Chest x-ray did not show any signs of congestive heart failure.  Management: The patient was provided with immediate medical attention including oxygen  morphine  nitroglycerine  and a loading dose of aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor. He was soon moved for an emergency angiogram which showed a severe blockage in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Subsequent primary PCI was performed successfully. Post-procedure  he was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy  nitrate  beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and statin  along with anti-diabetic medication.  Conclusion:  Mr. J has a well-known risk profile for CAD – advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  obesity  poor dietary habits  and having poorly controlled hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and a history of smoking. He is a quintessential high-risk patient with a history of multiple MIs and revascularization procedures. This case underscores the importance of aggressive risk factor modification and strict adherence to pharmacotherapy in preventing further cardiac events in CAD patients.
Coronary artery disease,7,12,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in an Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Patient information  A 68-year-old African American male patient  living in an urban setting in San Francisco  California  was reported to us. The patient is retired from a stressful high-ranking corporate job and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker and seldom consumes alcohol. He has a history of obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.9  and a family history of heart disease  with both his father and elder brother having succumbed to myocardial infarctions.  Clinical Findings  The patient presented with complaints of frequent chest pain that extends to his left shoulder and upper abdomen  exertional breathlessness  fatigue  and occasional bouts of tachycardia for the past three months. These symptoms are particularly exacerbated by physical labor and stressful circumstances and partially relieved by rest.  Diagnosis  Complete blood picture including troponin I and troponin T markers  lipid profile  random blood glucose test  an electrocardiogram (EKG)  and Doppler echocardiography were the diagnostic tools that were initially employed. The blood tests revealed raised troponin levels  a high cholesterol value exceeding 240 mg/dL  and marginally high glucose levels  indicating hyperlipidemia and pre-diabetes status. EKG and echocardiography showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced ejection fraction  suggesting myocardial ischemia. These results along with the patient’s symptoms gave a provisional diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary angiography was conducted later for confirmation  which unveiled significant stenosis in two major coronary arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention  Once the diagnosis was confirmed  the patient was started on medical management with aspirin  statins  beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and nitroglycerin for angina relief. He was given lifestyle modification guidelines- regular moderate physical exercise  a low-sodium and low-fat diet  weight reduction plan  and stress management techniques. The patient was also referred to a dietician and a psychotherapist for better handling of his obesity and stress.  Follow up and outcomes  The patient showed considerable improvement in symptoms after two months of therapy  with a reduction in the frequency and intensity of angina attacks and considerable weight loss. His lipid profile also showed desirable improvement. Unfortunately  the patient suffered a minor heart attack three months into the treatment  which was managed promptly with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the affected artery and stent placement. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy and continues his CAD medications with regular follow-ups.  Learning Points:  Reiterating the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and controlling risk factors for CAD since it remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment modalities  CAD can still result in severe complications such as heart attacks if not managed properly and promptly. It also emphasizes the importance of regular follow-up and strict compliance with medications and treatment plans in high-risk individuals. 
Coronary artery disease,7,13,Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in New York City. His profession is a retired school teacher. He is a smoker  with a 20-year history of tobacco use. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has no known drug allergies.   Presenting Complaints: The patient complained of recurrent chest pain for the past three months which intensified over the previous week. The pain often radiated to his left arm and neck. Accompanying symptoms included fatigue  irregular heartbeats  shortness of breath  and dizziness.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension five years ago. Both conditions were well-controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Additionally  he has a family history of heart disease. His father suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure (150/95 mmHg) and resting heart rate of 90 beats per minute. BMI calculation indicated obesity with a BMI of 32. No murmurs or abnormal heart sounds were heard on auscultation.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and ST-segment depression. Echocardiogram indicated decreased ejection fraction. Coronary angiography demonstrated significant (70%) stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. He was prescribed a beta-blocker  a statin to lower cholesterol levels  and aspirin to reduce the likelihood of blood clots. The patient was counseled for smoking cessation and referred for a cardiac rehabilitation program involving exercise training  education on heart healthy living  and counseling to reduce stress and help return to an active life.  Follow-up and Outcomes: At a 3-month follow-up  the patient reported considerable improvement  with no recurrent chest pain. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels had reduced to normal ranges. The BMI had also decreased  indicating progress in weight loss. He had successfully quit smoking and had significantly reduced alcohol intake.  Clinical Lessons: This case underlines the importance of risk factor management in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Concurrent diabetes and hypertension  along with lifestyle choices and hereditary factors could accelerate atherosclerosis leading to significant CAD. Further  it emphasizes on the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in preventing long-term morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. It also highlights the therapeutic benefits of lifestyle alterations as part of disease management. 
Coronary artery disease,7,14,Title: Coronary Artery Disease in a 65 Years Old Male  Case Report  I. Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  who presented with intense chest pain and discomfort at rest. He is a retired engineer  living with his wife in San Antonio  Texas. He has two grown children living separately. The patient was a long-time smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol moderately. His typical diet includes a high ratio of fats and carbohydrates. His socio-economic status is in the middle class  with access to quality healthcare.  II. Past Medical History:  The patient had a past medical history suggestive for cardiovascular diseases  primarily focusing on hypertension for the last ten years and type-2 diabetes mellitus for five years. Both conditions are under control with proper medication and diet plans. The patient also has a family history of heart diseases  mainly his father had myocardial infarction at the age of 70. The patient’s cholesterol profile was found to be deranged six months ago. There was an absence of any psychotic  cancerous  or infectious diseases in his past medical history.  III. Chief Complaint:  The patient complained of central chest pain at rest  which was worsening over the past few days. The pain was sometimes radiating towards his left arm and was associated with breathlessness and fatigue.  IV. Diagnosis:  Given his age  past comorbidities  and symptoms  his electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests were done immediately. His ECG showed ST-segment elevation. Troponin I levels came back high  which confirmed a case of myocardial infarction (MI).   Imaging modalities  including Echocardiogram and coronary angiography  were performed post-MI to evaluate the extent of damage and coronary blockages. Angiography identified severe stenosis in the Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD). The patient was then diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  V. Outcome and follow up:  The patient was initially treated with aspirin  nitroglycerin  and a statin  followed by an emergency coronary angioplasty with stent placement in the LAD. His post-intervention period was stable. Considering his lifestyle and comorbidities  the patient was recommended to follow a low diet  regular cardiovascular exercises  and further drug therapy including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  anti-platelet drugs and statins. He was also suggested to continuously monitor blood sugar  cholesterol  and blood pressure levels. The patient will be kept on regular follow-ups to prevent further events and monitor the progression of the disease.  This case report is a classic presentation of coronary artery disease in the African-American male population. The patient's age  racial background  sex  lifestyle choices  and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are some of the significant risk factors seen often in the literature for CAD. It emphasizes the importance of timely intervention and lifestyle changes to manage CAD.
Coronary artery disease,7,15,Patient Profile:   Mr. A.B.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Symptoms:   The patient presented with episodes of angina on exertion  which resolves with rest within 10 minutes.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a retired engineer  a resident of California  USA  and is married with two grown children.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A.B. has a history of controlled hypertension for the past 10 years. He manages his condition with Amlodipine 5 mg and Lisinopril 10 mg once daily. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for five years  which is fairly controlled with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He has a 40 pack/year smoking history but quit two years ago.   There is no history of previous cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks. Additionally  there is no history of peripheral vascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia. However  his father had coronary arteries disease and passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. The patient consumes alcohol moderately and does not have any known drug allergies.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  Mr. A.B. appeared comfortable and was in no apparent distress. His vital signs were within normal limits  with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  pulse rate 65 beats per minute  body weight 80 kg  height 175 cm  and BMI about 26 kg/m2. Heart examination showed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Laboratory Results:  Laboratory tests revealed that his lipid profile was not under optimal control  with an LDL cholesterol of 140 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol of 35 mg/dL. His HbA1c was 7.1%  indicating that his diabetes was not well controlled either. All other routine blood test results were within normal limits.   Assessment:  The history of exertional angina  along with his uncontrolled LDL cholesterol level and risk factors such as age  hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of heart disease puts Mr. A.B. in high suspicion of having CAD.  Plan:  Mr. A.B. was recommended for an EKG and stress test for further evaluation. It was recommended that his hypertension and cholesterol be controlled more aggressively with lifestyle modifications and adjustments in his medications. He was also encouraged to strictly adhere to a diabetic diet and exercise regularly to better manage his diabetes.  Informed consent was obtained from Mr. A.B. for the needed investigations  and he agreed to follow up in the clinic after the tests. He was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences chest pain at rest  un-resolving angina  or any other concerning symptoms.
Coronary artery disease,7,16,CASE REPORT  Patient Information: Patient[X]  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  was presented to the cardiology outpatient department. He resides in a suburban area and is a retired engineer. He is a non-smoker but has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. He is widowed and lives with his son's family.   Clinical Findings: The patient reported exertional chest pain radiating to his left arm for the past month. The pain was progressive and more persistent over the past week. He also complained about occasional bouts of breathlessness and lightheadedness.   Past Medical History: The past medical history revealed that the patient has been hypertensive for the last 15 years and is on regular antihypertensive medication. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 8 years back and is on oral hypoglycemic agents. His father had passed away at the age of 75 due to myocardial infarction.   Clinical Examination: On examination  he was slightly overweight with a BMI of 27 kg/m2. His blood pressure was raised (160/100 mmHg). After conducting physical examinations and laboratory investigations  an ECG (Electrocardiogram) was ordered  and it showed abnormalities  suggesting ischemic heart disease.   Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical findings  and ECG results  a tentative diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) was made. A coronary angiogram was suggested for further confirmation and was carried out the following day. The angiogram confirmed severe CAD.  Treatment: The patient was treated with an angioplasty and stent placement and prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) along with statins and ACE inhibitors. He was also advised lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise  dietary changes  and complete abstinence from alcohol.   The current report presents a case of a 67-year old man with risk factors for CAD including age  sex  hypertension  diabetes  and positive family history. His lifestyle habits further augment these risks. This case highlights the importance of regular checks and early intervention in patients with risk factors to prevent complications such as myocardial infarction.   Plans for follow-up: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit after two weeks of discharge and then every three months to monitor his recovery and adjust medications as required. He will also attend routine cardiology check-ups in outpatient clinics. Educational interventions regarding lifestyle modifications and medication adherence have been planned.
Coronary artery disease,7,17,Case Report:  Subject: Mr. Robert T.   Demographics:  Mr. Robert T.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male born and raised in Boston  Massachusetts. He lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He retired three years ago from his job as a regional manager for a retail company.   Medical History:  Mr. Robert has a documented history of hypertension  which has been relatively well managed with medication for the last 15 years. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which he regulates mainly through diet and exercise  supplemented by Metformin. He is noted to have a BMI of 29  indicating he is overweight. There is a significant family history of heart diseases  with his father passing away from a heart attack in his late 50s. Mr. Robert is a former smoker  having quit approximately 10 years ago. He admits to a history of moderate alcohol consumption  but states he now only drinks occasionally during social events.   Coronary Artery Disease History:  Approximately 3 years ago  Mr. Robert was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) following complaints of exertional dyspnea and episodes of chest discomfort. Subsequent evaluation with stress test and coronary angiography showed significant stenosis in multiple coronary arteries.  Treatment and Progress: He was initially managed with medical therapy including Aspirin  Metoprolol  and Rosuvastatin. However  due to worsening symptoms and inadequate control of the ischemia  he underwent coronary artery bypass surgery two years ago. Since the surgery  his symptoms have been well-managed. He is currently enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program.  Follow-Up: In recent visits  he has reported occasional mild dyspnea on exertion but denied any chest pain. His diabetes and hypertension are well-managed. His current medications include Aspirin  Metoprolol  Rosuvastatin  Lisinopril  and Metformin. He has regular follow-ups at the cardiology clinic  and the last treadmill stress test performed 6 months ago was negative for ischemia.  Mr. Robert's case illustrates the typical progression of Coronary Artery Disease in patients with multiple risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  obesity  family history  smoking  and advanced age. While medical therapy remains the first line of treatment in such cases  surgical options like coronary artery bypass surgery may be explored if symptoms and disease progression cannot be adequately controlled with medication. Regular follow-up  cardiac rehabilitation  and lifestyle modifications also hold a crucial role in the management of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,7,18,Title: Case Report on a 63-Year-old African American Male with Coronary Artery Disease  Presenting Patient Information  The patient is a 63-year old African American male  presenting with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm. He is a retired mechanical engineer  non-smoker  moderate alcohol intake  with a BMI of 30.5  and follows a sedentary lifestyle. His family history is significant for early onset of cardiovascular disease.  Past Medical History  The patient has Hypertension  type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and Hyperlipidemia. He has been treated with antihypertensive drugs (Losartan) and lipid-lowering agents (Simvastatin) but has low therapeutic adherence. He has been on Metformin for his diabetes  which is moderately controlled. He has no known allergies. In the past  he had been hospitalized for suspected acute coronary syndrome but discharged after tests (EKG  Cardiac enzymes) returned normal.  Current Presentation  The patient reports a recent history of recurrent severe pang-like chest pain  intermittent in nature  predominantly triggered by physical exertion. He describes it as intense pressure  similar to “an elephant sitting on my chest.” Pain is associated with shortness of breath  presyncope  and diaphoresis. Symptoms usually relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin or rest. There were no symptoms of Orthopnea  Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or lower limb swelling.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Evaluation  Current physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds  with no murmurs or gallops. The peripheral vascular exam uncovered diminished pulses in the lower limbs  with no edema.  Based on his presentation and clinical information  exercise stress ECG was counselled and performed later after obtaining his informed consent. It revealed ST-segment depressions  indicating myocardial ischemia. He was also administered echocardiography which showed impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%. Laboratory tests returned with elevated HbA1c and LDL cholesterol levels  indicative of uncontrolled diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  Diagnosis  The patient was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD)  was counselled and consented to undergo coronary angiography. The procedure demonstrated multi-vessel disease with significant stenosis occluding 85% of the artery's lumen in the proximal segment of his left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 70% stenosis in the left circumflex (LCX) artery.  Conclusion  This case illustrates CAD presenting with typical features of stable angina pectoris in a 63-year old African American male with multiple risk factors including hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  advanced age and family history. The case emphasizes the importance of strict control of modifiable risk factors and medication adherence to prevent progression of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,7,19,Title: Case Report of a 65-Year-Old Female Patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Information The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented with a progressive history of chest pain predominantly on exertion. This discomfort had been increasing in frequency and severity over the last 6 weeks. She lives in a suburban neighborhood  is a retired school teacher and has been widowed for five years. The patient has a BMI of 28  indicating she is overweight  consistent with reported lack of exercise and a somewhat sedentary lifestyle.   Medical History The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 8 years prior  for which she is taking medication (a beta-blocker and a statin  respectively). However  she admitted that she had been non-compliant with her medications for the past few months due to their cost. She has no history of diabetes  but recent blood work has shown slightly elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Additionally  she has a long history of smoking  having started in her late teens  though she quit around the age of 54. The patient denied any history of alcohol or substance abuse. There's a strong family history of CAD  with her father having died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Clinical Findings On physical examination  she appeared comfortable at rest with normal vital signs  besides slightly elevated blood pressure (145/90 mmHg). Chest auscultation revealed no abnormal heart sounds. A 12-lead ECG demonstrated non-specific ST-T wave changes but no acute ST-segment or T-wave changes.   Diagnosis and Treatment Given the patient’s symptoms and risk factors  a diagnosis of stable angina due to CAD was highly suspected. As such  she was initially managed conservatively with beta-blockers  aspirin  and statins. She was also counseled on the importance of lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  diet changes  maintaining a healthy weight  and strict compliance with medications.  Follow-up procedures  i.e.  stress testing and coronary angiography  were scheduled. These would help in confirming the CAD diagnosis  gauge disease severity  and guide long-term management  such as potential revascularization strategies. She was also reminded of the need for regular follow-up for her hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and for evaluation regarding her elevated fasting blood glucose levels.  Learning Points This case highlights the importance of symptom recognition and early intervention in CAD. The patient’s non-compliance to medication regimen aggravated her risk factors. Regular follow-ups and medication compliance are crucial elements of disease management that cannot be overlooked. Furthermore  lifestyle interventions are equally essential in managing and preventing progression of CAD.  Despite being female and reported to have a lower incidence of CAD  her risk was elevated due to the presence of multiple risk factors such as hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking  lack of physical activity  overweight  family history and advanced age. This illustrates that CAD is not exclusive to males  especially in the presence of significant risk factors.
Coronary artery disease,7,20,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  retired office worker  referred to our cardiology department from the primary care clinic due to symptoms consistent with coronary artery disease. The patient is married  has two children  is a resident of the Midlands  South Carolina  United States  and frequently attends a local church as his primary social activity. Smokes one pack of cigarettes per day  a habit he has maintained for over 45 years. He admits to regular consumption of alcohol  primarily on weekends  and admits to a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet rich in fats and processed foods.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known past medical history of hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes 2.5 mg of Ramipril daily and 1000 mg of Metformin twice daily. The patient's father and paternal uncle also had coronary artery disease; his father suffered a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 65. There is no history of stroke or other cardiovascular diseases reported in the family. The patient's BMI was noted to be 30  obtained from a weight of 200 pounds and a height of 5’9'’  an indication of obesity.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reported experiencing moderate to severe episodes of chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and lower jaw. Episodes are often precipitated by physical exertion or emotional stress. Symptoms are relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. He also reported shortness of breath  especially when climbing stairs or walking more than two blocks.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis:  Cardiac auscultation revealed normal first and second heart sounds with no audible murmurs. The patient's blood pressure was 148/90 mmHg  which was high. An ECG indicated signs of possible previous myocardial infarction. Lipid panel showed elevated LDL cholesterol (140 mg/dL) and Total cholesterol (210 mg/dL)  reduced HDL cholesterol (35mg/dL)  and elevated triglycerides (300 mg/dL). Fasting blood glucose was 156 mg/dL.   Given the patient's age  obesity  lifestyle behavior  family history of premature coronary artery disease  and hypertension combined with hyperlipidemia  the patient was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) through a coronary angiogram  which showed two-vessel disease  including 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 60% stenosis of the right coronary artery.  Management and Follow Up:  The patient was started on Aspirin 81mg  Rosuvastatin 20 mg every night  and Metoprolol 25mg twice daily  with continuation of antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication. A comprehensive approach including smoking cessation  dietary modification  and regular physical activity was emphasized for managing the disease. The patient is scheduled for follow-up in three months to reassess symptoms and monitor treatment progress. Subsequent management will be tailored further based on follow-up evaluation.   This case represents a common presentation for CAD in the African American geriatric population with common risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia.

Chief Complaint  The patient came with a chief complaint of a recurring chest discomfort  notable during his slight physical exertions like climbing stairs or walking fast. He mentioned that the pain usually eases off with rest and usually lasts about five to fifteen minutes.  3. History of Present Illness  For the past two months  the patient has been experiencing episodes of chest pain that seemed to worsen with physical activity and intensifies under stress. No patterns related to meal intake or sleep were noted.   4. Past Medical History  The patient is known to have a controlled hypertension diagnosed eight years prior and hyperlipidemia diagnosed five years ago  maintained well on medication. There is no known history of diabetes mellitus or other chronic medical conditions.  5. Review of Systems  Apart from chest discomfort  he reports shortness of breath  occasional restlessness  or a sense of impending doom during the angina attacks. However  he denies episodes of sweating  syncope  nausea  or vomiting.  6. Physical Examination  He appeared anxious  but his vital signs were within normal limits. There was no cyanosis  clubbing  or peripheral edema. Normal heart sounds were present with no additional murmurs. His blood pressure was slightly elevated  but not alarming (150/85 mmHg)  and his oxygen saturation was maintained at 97%.  7. Diagnostic Assessment  An Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression suggestive of underlying myocardial ischemia. High-sensitivity troponin levels were within normal limits  ruling out a myocardial infarction. Lipid profile showed elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels.   The patient underwent a stress test  which demonstrated significant ST depressions  further suggestive of ischemia. Coronary angiography was subsequently performed and revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery  consistent with coronary artery disease.  8. Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was managed conservatively with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) and a high-intensity statin. His antihypertensive therapy was reviewed and optimized. He was referred to a cardiologist for possible revascularization therapy (PCI/CABG) based on the angiogram results.   The patient and his family were extensively counseled regarding lifestyle modifications  including a regimen of regular exercise  healthy diet  weight management  and stress management. The importance of medication adherence was reinforced.  9. Follow-Up  A close follow-up plan was designed for the patient including a repeat lipid profile  cardiac function assessment  and regular outpatient clinic visits to monitor his symptoms and assess response to the intervention.  10. Patient Consent  Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.  This case report emphasizes the pivotal role of early detection and prompt management of coronary artery disease  particularly in individuals with high risk such as our patient - given age  race  male gender  genetic predisposition  and additional risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Coronary artery disease,7,22,"Patient Information:  An 82-year-old African American male residing in North Carolina  United States  was presented for evaluation due to persistent chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient is widowed  Catholic  and retired after working for over 40 years as a truck driver. He currently lives with his daughter and her family. He is covered by Medicare insurance.  Medical History:  The patient has an extensive medical history  including a 30-year history of Type II Diabetes and moderate renal insufficiency. His Diabetes is currently under control through diet and oral medication (Metformin). He also has been previously diagnosed with essential hypertension  for which he is on Amlodipine and Losartan. He does not have any known allergies to medications. Apart from these  the patient has lived a relatively healthy life  with his last hospitalization over twenty years ago due to a minor operation for a hernia.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reported severe episodes of chest pain which he described as """"pressure"""" on his chest  occasionally radiates to his left upper arm  and shortness of breath  aggravated by minimal physical activity. He also reported a frequent feeling of exhaustion and episodes of dizziness.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared sweaty and in distress due to chest pain. His vitals recorded were as follows: BP - 170/90 mm Hg  HR - 100 bpm  RR - 22 breaths per minute  Temperature - 36.8°C  and Oxygen saturation - 90% on room air. On auscultation  his heart sounds were regular without any murmur or gallop and lung fields were clear.  Investigations:  His lipid profile showed high LDL cholesterol (180mg/dL) and relatively low HDL cholesterol (30mg/dL). Cardiac enzymes drawn showed a troponin level of 0.04ng/ml (normal <.03ng/ml). Further testing unveiled an elevated blood glucose level of 180mg/dL and impaired renal function with a creatinine level of 1.8mg/dL. ECG performed demonstrated signs consistent with ischemia  notably ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion. Subsequent coronary angiography confirmed significant obstructive disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX).  Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with Unstable Angina secondary to Severe Coronary Artery Disease.  Management:  Treatment was initiated with sublingual Nitroglycerin for acute relief of the chest pain and increased dosage of his antihypertensive medications in order to control his blood pressure. Aspirin and a high dose statin were also commenced. A decision was made for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) targeting both the LAD and LCX lesions which was performed successfully without any procedural complications.  After PCI  cardiac rehabilitation was recommended  along with counseling for lifestyle modification  including smoking cessation  regular physical activity  and a healthy diet. He was also referred for close follow-up in the outpatient clinic with a cardiologist and an endocrinologist.   Informed consent:  The patient provided informed consent for his case report to be published. "
Coronary artery disease,7,23,"Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Presentation  The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male standing 5'10"""" tall  weighing 210 lbs with a BMI of 30.1. He is presented in the clinic with the chief complaints of frequent episodes of chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath and light-headedness that increasingly occur even at rest. The pain reportedly radiates to his left arm and is frequently accompanied by a sensation of nausea. He lives in a middle-class suburban neighborhood with his wife  is a retired army officer  and reports a 30-pack per year history of smoking tobacco  though he quit five years ago. He reports consuming alcohol on social occasions.   Past Medical History  The patient has a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosed at the age of 50 and is managed on Metformin (twice daily dose of 500mg). His mother died of a myocardial infarction in her seventies  and his 69-year-old sibling has T2DM and hypertension. He has been treated for high cholesterol (on statin therapy with Atorvastatin 20mg per day) and hypertension (metoprolol 50mg twice daily). He has never been prescribed anticoagulants and reports no allergies or drug sensitivities.   Clinical Findings  Physical examination reveals a body temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F)  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and arterial blood pressure of 148/90 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% while breathing room air. Cardiac examination reveals distant heart sounds and a soft systolic murmur. His lungs are clear and other systems are unremarkable. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows T-wave inversions in the inferolateral leads. Blood tests revealed slightly raised troponin I (0.04 ng/mL; normal range: <0.03 ng/mL) and a HbA1c of 7.2% indicating suboptimal control of his diabetes.  Impression  Based on the findings of history taking along with physical examination and investigations done  he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). His age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and family history of cardiac disease put him in a high-risk category for CAD. Management has included dual antiplatelet therapy  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and beta-blockers. Patient has been counseled about lifestyle modifications including healthier dietary choices  moderate exercise  weight loss  and strict diabetic control.   Follow Up  The patient was taken for a coronary angiogram that revealed significant three-vessel disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention was initially considered. However  given the patient's three-vessel disease and diabetes  coronary artery bypass grafting was considered the best therapeutic option. He has been referred to discuss further management with a cardiothoracic surgeon.  This case stresses how important it is to screen and initiate appropriate treatment for at-risk individuals in a primary care setting. By considering coronary artery disease in the differential diagnosis  the primary care physician can act promptly  possibly preventing further cardiac damage or even fatal events."
Coronary artery disease,7,24,Title: Management of Coronary Artery Disease in a 60-Year-Old African-American Male  Introduction: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in African-American men. This case study presents the case of a 60-year-old African-American male with CAD  with a focus on his cardiovascular risk factors  diagnosis  treatment approach  and patient adherence to prescribed therapeutic regimens.  Patient Information: Mr. LB  a 60-year-old African-American male  presented to the hospital for a routine health check-up. He is a retired teacher and is currently living a sedentary lifestyle. He has had previous hospital admissions due to angina pectoris. The patient had past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which were diagnosed ten years ago. Mr. LB is also a former smoker who had quit 15 years ago.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient was overweight with a BMI of 29 kg/m^2 and a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  beyond his target blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg). His blood sugar levels were elevated at 180 mg/dl (normal range: 70-110 mg/dl). His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression suggestive of ischemia.  Diagnosis: Based on patient history  clinical findings and racial predisposition  a provisional diagnosis of coronary artery disease was made. This was later confirmed through a coronary angiography which revealed a 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: Initial management included lifestyle modifications such as dietary counseling for weight reduction  exercise prescription for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily  and sodium restriction. Pharmacologically  the patient was already on metformin for diabetes. An ACE inhibitor was started for hypertension and the antiplatelet drug  aspirin  was added for his CAD. Statin therapy was also introduced to control his dyslipidemia.  Follow-up and Outcome: Within three months of starting therapy and lifestyle modifications  patient reported a significant decrease in episodes of angina. His blood pressure was reduced to 131/80 mmHg and blood glucose levels were better controlled at 140 mg/dl. The LDL cholesterol level also showed a significant decrease.  Discussion: This case underscores the importance of multi-factorial intervention on lifestyle modification and appropriate medication in managing patients with high cardiovascular risk. CAD is often part of a wider picture of multi-morbidity in patients with hypertension and diabetes  as is seen in this patient  and requires careful management.

Coronary artery disease,7,25,Title: A Case Report of a 64-Year-Old Hispanic Male with Coronary Artery Disease  Introduction:  Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a condition that involves narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis  further limiting the supply of oxygenated blood to the heart. There are approximately 18.2 million adults aged 20 and older with CAD in the United States  with men having a higher prevalence than women. Hispanics make up the second largest racial/ethnic group in individuals with CAD.   Patient Information:  We report the case of Mr. G  a 64-year-old Hispanic male with a documented diagnosis of CAD. Mr. G was born and raised in Puerto Rico before moving to the United States at the age of 30. His BMI is 27  making him slightly overweight. He is a former smoker  with a history of smoking one pack a day for twenty years  and quit ten years ago. He works as a mechanic and lives with his wife.   Medical History:  A past medical history revealed that Mr. G has a history of hypertension which was diagnosed eight years ago. He is currently on medication (50mg of Metoprolol once daily and 10mg of Lisinopril) and manages his blood pressure through nutritional restrictions and regular physical exercise. He also reported dyslipidemia  managed with 20 mg rosuvastatin. There is a family history of both heart disease and diabetes. His father passed away from a heart attack at 70 and his mother has been living with type II diabetes.  Current Presentation:  Mr. G reported episodes of chest discomfort for the past two months  more specifically following physical efforts such as climbing stairs. These episodes were characterized by a squeezing chest pain radiating towards his left shoulder  usually relieved by rest  and were occasionally accompanied by shortness of breath. ECG revealed evidence of slight ST-segment depression during the episodes of chest pain.   Management and Follow-Up:   The primary care physician referred the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation. After his assessment  the cardiologist recommended a Trans-Thoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) and a coronary angiogram to delineate the disease severity and distribution throughout the coronary arteries.   Based on the patient's symptoms and past medical history  it was decided that a conservative treatment approach involving lifestyle modification  pharmacotherapy  and vigilant monitoring of the disease should be followed initially. This involved reinforcement of the need for adherence to a low-cholesterol  low-sodium diet  enhanced physical activity  maintaining a healthy weight  and regular follow-ups.   Conclusion:  This case aims to showcase CAD in a Hispanic male  emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive history  diagnostic tools  and the efficacy of conservative management as first-line treatment. Early diagnosis and optimal management of traditional risk factors remain crucial in CAD.  Also  it underscores the complexity in managing a patient with multiple comorbidities and draws attention towards the need for individualized patient care based on disease progression  lifestyle  tolerability  and ethnic/racial backgrounds. In such cases  collaborative efforts between primary care physicians and cardiologists can play a crucial role in preventing major cardiovascular events.

Effective prevention and management strategies are essential to reduce the impact of this pervasive disease.   Patient Information:  A 52-year-old African American male presented to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain for the last three months. He describes the pain as 'crushing' in character  radiating to his left arm  associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These episodes have been noted to occur primarily during exertion and alleviated with rest.   He is a resident of New Orleans  Louisiana  living with his wife and two children  and works as a high-school principal. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day for the last 30 years and has a family history of heart disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. His alcohol intake is restricted to social drinking.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient's vital signs were Temperature 37.2 C  Pulse 95 per minute  Blood pressure 140/95mmHg  and Respiration rate 20 per minute. His BMI was calculated to be 29.8 (height – 173cm  weight – 90kg)  falling into the 'Overweight' category. Auscultation revealed regular heart sounds  no murmurs or gallops. Lungs were clear  and his peripheral pulses were strong and regular.  Diagnostic Assessment:  His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T wave inversions in leads V1-V4. Blood tests revealed raised Troponin I levels suggesting cardiac injury. Total cholesterol was 250mg/dL  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 170mg/dL  and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 38mg/dL.    Based on history  examination and investigations  he was diagnosed with Coronary artery disease (CAD).   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was prescribed aspirin 75 mg once daily for platelet inhibition  Atorvastatin 40mg once daily to lower cholesterol levels  and Metoprolol 50mg once daily for heart rate control. He was also advised to quit smoking  limit alcohol intake  follow a diet low in sodium and saturated fat  and engage in moderate-intensity exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. He was scheduled for follow-up every three months to monitor blood pressure  cholesterol levels and signs of any adverse drug reactions.  Outcomes:  Upon follow-up after three months  the frequency and intensity of his chest pain decreased significantly. His blood cholesterol levels have notably improved (Total cholesterol – 190mg/dL  LDL-C - 120mg/dL  HDL-C – 45mg/dL) and blood pressure controlled (125/80mmHg)  indicating a positive response to medication and lifestyle changes.  This case report emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt intervention in managing CAD  highlighting the significance of lifestyle changes along with pharmacological measures. Comprehensive care  including routine follow-up  is crucial for a better prognosis and improving the quality of life of CAD patients.   References: - Upon request.

The pain was associated with sweating and a feeling of faintness.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Browning has a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 12 years  managed with metformin and amlodipine respectively. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia for which he has been on atorvastatin for the last 10 years. There was no history of previous surgeries  allergies  or other significant medical conditions. There were no relevant childhood diseases or accidents. His last known echocardiogram done two years ago showed no abnormalities. Family history revealed that his father had suffered from a heart attack at the age of 72.  Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Browning appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 165/95 mm Hg  pulse 98 bpm  respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  and SpO2 95% on room air. His cardiovascular examination revealed soft S1 and a loud A2. He had no murmurs or additional sounds.  Further Evaluation:  An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6  suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Blood workup confirmed the diagnosis with elevated cardiac troponin levels. Complete blood count  renal function  and electrolytes were all within normal limits. However  his lipid profile was deranged with elevated LDL and triglycerides levels.  Follow Up:  Given the urgency of the situation  Mr. Browning was immediately transferred to the coronary care unit and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The angiogram revealed a 90% lesion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery  which was successfully dilated and stented. The patient responded well to the intervention with ST-segment resolution and alleviation of his symptoms.  Management:  Post-procedure  Mr. Browning was placed on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and ticagrelor)  along with continuation of statins  antihypertensive  and diabetic medications. He was also introduced to an aggressive lifestyle modification program including dietary changes  smoking cessation  regular cardio-based exercise  and stress management interventions.  Conclusion:  This case report underscores the importance of early identification and management of modifiable risk factors in patients with coronary artery disease. Efficient and prompt intervention in acute coronary syndromes can successfully restore myocardial perfusion and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.

Coronary artery disease,7,40,Patient Description:  The patient is a 64-year old African-American male named Mr. Williams. He lives in uptown Chicago  Illinois  with his wife. The patient is a retired army veteran and has a medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a non-smoker and exercises regularly.   Presenting Problem:  Mr. Williams presented to the hospital with central chest pain radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath over the last 24 hours. He also complained of increased fatigue and slight loss of appetite.  Medical History:  Upon history taking  it was noted that the patient has had issues with hypertension and has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus over five years ago. His hypertension has been fairly managed with amlodipine 5mg daily  and his diabetes has shown a good response to metformin 500 mg twice daily. There is family history of heart disease  as his father had suffered from a heart attack at the age of 60.  Clinical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient exhibited slight diaphoresis and appeared anxious. His heart rate was 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 per minute  blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Listening to the chest indicated a slight irregularity in heart rhythm.  Additional Testing:  The electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed ST-segment elevations indicative of a possible myocardial infarction. The troponin levels were obtained and came back significantly elevated.   Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation  EKG findings  and elevated troponin levels  the diagnosis of Acute ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) was made  indicating coronary artery disease.  Management:  The patient was managed immediately with aspirin  sublingual nitroglycerin  and a heparin drip. He was referred to the cardiology team and an urgent cardiac catheterization was performed  which confirmed occlusion in the left anterior descending artery. A stent was implanted successfully. Post-stenting follow-up included dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.  Mr. Williams was also advised on lifestyle management strategies  including low salt and low sugar diet  moderate physical activity  and stress management techniques to cope with his conditions.  Discussion:  The prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) varies and is influenced by factors such as age  gender  and race. The literature suggests that the prevalence increases in males over 65 years old and is higher in African-Americans (like Mr. Williams). However  lifestyles  including diet and physical activity  can significantly contribute to disease outcomes. This case of Mr. Williams highlights the importance of timely and proper interventions in CAD management for better patient outcomes.

Presenting Symptoms: Mr. A.B presented at the outpatient department with complaints of chronic chest pain characterized as squeezing and tightness in nature  radiating to his left arm. The chest pain is particularly pronounced during exertion and is often relieved by rest. He also reports experiencing episodes of shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional lightheadedness over a period of two months.  Clinical History: His medical history reveals diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 10 years ago (poorly controlled with metformin) and a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD)  with his father suffering a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 65. He was diagnosed with hypertension 7 years ago  which has been inadequately managed with intermittent use of Lisinopril.   Physical Examination: At consultation  his blood pressure recorded was 160/90 mmHg  BMI was 29.5  pulse was regular at 72 beats per minute  and his respirations were 18 per minute. On auscultation  his heart sounds were normal without any added sounds or murmurs. Lungs were clear on auscultation and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   Investigations and Results: Given his presenting symptoms  risk factors  and medical history  the provisional diagnosis of coronary artery disease was made. Subsequently  patient underwent various tests including blood tests  chest X-ray  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  Echocardiogram  stress tests and coronary angiogram.  Lab results indicated elevated levels of HbA1c and LDL cholesterol  while an ECG showed evidence of T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%. Angiography revealed severe disease with 85% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 70% stenosis of the right coronary artery.  Diagnosis and Management: The patient was diagnosed with severe coronary artery disease.  Cardiology consultation was sought  and it was decided to manage the patient with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Meanwhile  the patient was managed medically with dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and clopidogrel)  statin therapy  and tight control of diabetes and hypertension. Patient’s hypertension was managed with an increased dose of lisinopril and introduction of a calcium channel blocker  amlodipine. He was also advised to quit smoking  improve dietary habits and commence a regular  moderate-intensity physical activity.   Follow-Up: The patient responded well to the treatment and lifestyle modifications. He has been compliant with the medications and has shown regular improvements in six-monthly follow-ups. His chest pain has drastically reduced  and his exertional capacity has improved  allowing him to engage in daily activities. His BP is now under control at 130/80 mmHg  with improved HbA1c and LDL levels. He will continue to be monitored regularly for any worsening of his condition.

He does not have a known family history of coronary artery disease (CAD)  but his father had diabetes mellitus.  II. Clinical Presentation The patient reported to the hospital complaining of intermittent chest pain for the last few weeks  which was typically exacerbated by physical activity and mitigated by rest. There were no associated symptoms of radiation of pain  palpitations  syncope  or difficulty in breathing.   III. Past Medical History His past medical history includes hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril daily and type 2 diabetes mellitus  well controlled with Metformin. He has not previously been diagnosed with any cardiovascular diseases. There were no adverse drug reactions or allergies. He has avoided regular exercise throughout his life  noting sedentarism as his usual lifestyle pattern.  IV. Diagnosis A physical exam revealed standard values for blood pressure and pulse rate. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram were ordered given the characteristics and persistence of his symptoms despite antihypertensive medication. The ECG identified ST-segment depression  indicating possible myocardial ischemia. On further investigation with a coronary angiography  CAD was confirmed with the finding being consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease. Blood tests also indicated a raised LDL cholesterol level  contributing to atherogenesis.  V. Treatment and Follow-up The patient was treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to alleviate the blockages. He was also prescribed a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  aspirin  and a statin (atorvastatin) to manage his hypertension  improve blood flow  and lower his cholesterol levels. Following successful surgery  he was advised to attend cardiac rehabilitation.   He was recommended a diet low in saturated and trans fat  sodium  and added sugar  and encouraged to gradually introduce moderate-intensity physical activity into his daily routine taking his age and physical condition into account. The importance of regular outpatient check-ups was underlined to ensure the monitoring and control of his other risk factors  like diabetes and hypertension.  Six months later  the patient reported significantly reduced chest pain and greater capacity for physical exertivity. He remains under constant follow-up and continues to adhere to medication regimens and lifestyle modifications.

He is a former smoker  having quit roughly 10 years ago after a 30-year history of tobacco use. The patient's lifestyle included limited physical activity and a high-fat  high-sugar diet.  Presenting Complaint: The patient came in complaining of recurrent episodes of chest pain for the past month  sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue. He reported the pain as being more severe during physical activities or stress but subsided during periods of rest.  Clinical Findings: Clinical examination revealed a body mass index of 30 kg/m2  representative of obesity. The patient displayed moderate dyspnea on exertion. Blood pressure on presentation was 150/95 mmHg  and resting heart rate was 88 beats per minute. There were no acute distress  abnormal heart sound  or peripheral edema observed.  Diagnostic Assessments: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed features indicative of myocardial ischemia. Initial blood tests showed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (troponin I and CK-MB). Fasting blood analysis revealed hyperglycaemia (190 mg/dl) and hyperlipidemia (LDL 180 mg/dl  HDL 35 mg/dl). An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction. Coronary angiography was performed  which demonstrated significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially started on intravenous nitroglycerin for chest pain and oral aspirin  as well as a high-intensity statin. Glycemic control was maintained with Metformin and newly added Sitagliptin. Antihypertensive  including Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and a Beta-blocker  was introduced to control the blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications were suggested  including a healthier diet  regular exercise  and weight reduction. The patient was later taken up for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) considering significant stenosis.  Follow-Up and Outcome One month following the PCI  the patient reported a significant reduction in chest pain frequency and severity. Shortness of breath and fatigue had also improved. His blood pressure had decreased to 130/80 mmHg  and glycemic control improved (HbA1c 7.1%).

Personal Medical History: GM had hypertension diagnosed at the age of 50 and has been on and off antihypertensive medications due to poor compliance. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago  which is currently managed with oral antidiabetic medication (Metformin). His BMI is 28  indicating he is overweight.  GM was previously diagnosed with favorable prognosis localized prostate cancer at age 58 and completed treatment. He has also noted to suffer from mild osteoarthritis  triggering occasional joint pain.  Family Medical History: GM's father died of a myocardial infarction at age 67. His mother had hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. GM has a younger sister with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a younger brother who died in a motor vehicle accident at age 29.  Clinical Assessment:  Upon examination  GM's blood pressure was elevated at 145/90 mmHg  and heart rate was at 92 beats per minute. His lipids profile reported high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 160mg/dL and total cholesterol of 220mg/dL. Blood sugar levels were slightly above the desired range indicative of sub optimal blood glucose control.   A resting electrocardiogram revealed a left ventricular hypertrophy  and a stress echocardiogram showed evidence of myocardial ischemia.  Diagnosis:  Considering the patient’s reported symptoms  family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD)  presence of multiple risk factors like hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  and evidence of stress-induced ischemia  a presumptive diagnosis of the coronary artery disease was made.  Treatment and Management: Post-diagnosis GM was admitted and treated initially with nitroglycerin that provided considerable relief in chest discomfort. A dual antiplatelet regimen with aspirin and clopidogrel along with high-intensity statin therapy was initiated. He also started on a beta-blocker to control his hypertension and reduce the heart rate  as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) for cardiovascular protection.  His diabetes and dyslipidemia management were optimized with strict patient education on medication compliance and commitment to lifestyle changes  including diet and exercise.  The patient was also referred to cardiology for consideration of angiography to understand the extent of the disease better.  This case illustrates the classic presentation of CAD and highlights the importance of considering CAD in older adult patients  especially when multiple modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia are present. It also signifies the indispensable role of lifestyle modification and compliance to medication in disease management.
Coronary artery disease,7,46,Case Report  Patient Information:  Mr. James  a 58-year-old African-American male  visited our Out Patient Department on November 12  2022. He lives in Chicago  Illinois  and is married with two children. He is an attorney by profession and leads a sedentary lifestyle. Mr. James is a former smoker  having quit around five years ago after a 30-year history of tobacco use. He continues to drink alcohol moderately and has a diet high in saturated fats.  Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension 10 years ago  which has been controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). Around 6 years back  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he takes Metformin 500mg twice daily. He is also known to have hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Atorvastatin (20mg daily). His weight and Body Mass Index has been steadily increasing for the last 10 years  currently weighing 230 pounds (BMI 30.4) indicating obesity.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. James approached the clinic complaining of chronic chest discomfort for the past 2 weeks  described as pressure-like pain located in the center of his chest  radiating to his left arm. The pain usually appears after heavy meals or physical exertion and is promptly relieved by rest. He also mentions occasional episodes of shortness of breath and heart palpitations. However  he denies any symptoms of light-headedness  syncope  fever  cough  or sweating.   Initial Impressions and Management:  These symptoms are suggestive of angina pectoris  pointing towards coronary artery disease (CAD). However  a definitive diagnosis can only be made based on detailed investigations. Mr. James was advised to undertake a series of diagnostic tests  including a complete blood profile  ECG  stress test  and coronary angiography. Meanwhile  patient's statin medication was continued and he was prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin tablets for immediate relief from chest pain.   Long-term management considerations include lifestyle modifications such as a low salt and low cholesterol diet  routine physical exercise  weight loss  and optimal control of blood pressure  lipids and blood glucose. Regular follow-up visits are scheduled for monitoring his overall health status and adjusting the medication regimen  as necessary.  This case highlights the potentially severe  yet often asymptomatic nature of CAD in its early stages. Given his age  race  gender  sedentary lifestyle  history of smoking  saturated fat-rich diet  and pre-existing conditions such as hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus and hyperlipidemia  this patient falls into the high-risk category for CAD. Therefore  it is essential to proactively manage his case to prevent the progression of the disease and development of life-threatening complications such as myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease,7,47,Case Report - Patient with Coronary Artery Disease  Demographics:  Mr. M  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the outpatient department in October 2021. He is a retired schoolteacher and a widower with two adult children. His insurance is Medicare  and he resides in a suburban area of New Jersey. He has a documented history of smoking (20 cigarettes/day for approximately 30 years). Mr. M reported that his diet was high in fats and salts  and his physical activity level is low due to a sedentary lifestyle.   Medical History:  The patient has a long-standing history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (10 years)  Hypertension (5 years)  and Hyperlipidemia (6 years). He has been on Metformin 500 mg twice a day for diabetes  Lisinopril 20 mg once a day for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. M was initially referred to a primary care physician by a visiting nurse after complaining of chronic dyspnea  fatigue  and occasional chest discomfort. The severity of discomfort increased while doing household chores and abated on rest.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mm Hg  BMI of 29 kg/m2  elevated waist circumference  and palpable pedal edema. Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rhythm  no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Comprehensive lab tests unveiled elevated levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c  8%)  fasting lipid profile was disturbed with high levels of total cholesterol (5.8 mmol/L)  LDL-cholesterol (4.2 mmol/L) and triglycerides (2.9 mmol/L) whereas HDL-cholesterol was low (1 mmol/L).  An electrocardiogram (EKG) evidenced abnormal Q waves and ST-segment elevation  indicating possible myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was subsequently performed  revealing three-vessel disease  involving the proximal left anterior descending (LAD)  left circumflex (LCX)  and right coronary artery (RCA)  thus confirming the diagnosis of severe coronary artery disease (CAD).  Management and Follow-up:  Given the severity of the disease and the patient's comorbidities  he has been referred to a cardiac surgeon for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was also referred to a dietician to design a diet plan with lower salt and fat content. In terms of pharmacological management  his treating physician adjusted his hypertension medicine to a different one (Amlodipine 5 mg) because his blood pressure was not well-controlled with the previous one. It was also reinforced to Mr. M to adhere to his medication and to commit to lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking  engaging in daily physical activity and maintaining a cardiac-friendly diet.  This case highlights the complexity of managing coronary artery disease  especially in the presence of other comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia -- conditions that are common among African American males. A multidisciplinary approach involving a team of cardiologists  physicians  dietitians  and nurses is essential to successfully manage and improve the overall quality of life of the patient.
Coronary artery disease,7,48,Title: A Case Report of Coronary Artery Disease in a 60-year-old African-American Male  Introduction: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is highly prevalent in the global population and is known to have varied demographic and racial trends. According to several epidemiological studies  African-Americans have a higher prevalence of CAD. Herein  we present a case of CAD in a 60-year-old African-American male.  Case Presentation: Mr. C  a 60-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of central chest discomfort for a duration of half an hour  which radiated to the left arm. The pain was associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. There was no nausea  vomiting  or syncope. The medical history of the patient included 20-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further  Mr. C was a 30-pack year smoker with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.5 kg/m2. He reported no significant family history of heart disease.   Clinical findings: On examination  Mr. C was found to be dyspneic with blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 92 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Heart sounds were normal with no added sounds.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment depression suggestive of ischemia. Mr. C's troponin I levels were also elevated. These findings confirmed an acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography confirmed the presence of significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis (approximately 70%).  Other lab results indicated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.2 % and LDL cholesterol level of 190mg/dl.  Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-up: Mr. C was initially managed with aspirin  clopidogrel  atorvastatin  and low molecular weight heparin. Given the significant coronary artery stenosis  a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure was performed. In the postoperative phase  Mr. C's blood pressure and sugar levels were well controlled. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue with medications  maintain a diet with a low sodium and sugar content  quit smoking  and engage in a moderate exercise regimen. He has been following up for the past 6 months and reports improved quality of life with no recurrent chest pain.  Discussion: This case portrays the common demographic representation in CAD  i.e.  in a 60-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking  all well-established risk factors for CAD.  Conclusion: The prognosis of CAD greatly improves with early identification and intervention. It is crucial to meticulously evaluate patients with risk factors for CAD and offer lifestyle modification advice to prevent disease progression.

Presenting Problem: The patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of acute  severe chest pain radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath that began while he was lifting heavy equipment at work. The pain did not subside with rest.  Investigations and Findings: Electrocardiogram (ECG) in the emergency department indicated ST-segment elevation in II  III  aVF  V5  and V6 leads. Initial Troponin level was elevated at 2.6 ng/mL. These findings are suggestive of acute inferolateral myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed which revealed significant segmental narrowing of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and right coronary artery (RCA) suggestive of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Echocardiography showed a reduced ejection fraction of 45%.  Treatment and Follow-up: The patient underwent relevant treatment including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the insertion of drug-eluting stents in the LAD and RCA to restore blood flow. Management also includes antihypertensive medication  high-intensity statin for cholesterol  dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel)  glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors  and medications to manage his diabetes. The importance of lifestyle modifications was emphasized  including smoking cessation  a low-sodium and low-cholesterol diet  regular exercise  and proper medication adherence.  In the follow-up visits  the patient reported reduced chest pain and improved quality of life. He has joined a local gym to maintain regular physical activity and is attending a smoking cessation programme. Adjustments to his medication regimen were made as needed to control his hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. The patient will require regular monitoring and follow-up to ensure continued improvement of his health status and to prevent the progression of CAD.    Conclusion: This case demonstrates the negative impact of modifiable risk factors on an individual's health. Lifestyle modifications and adherence to prescribed medication can greatly improve a patient's prognosis. This case emphasizes the importance of primary prevention efforts and regular healthcare checkups for earlier detection of chronic diseases like CAD  especially in high-risk groups.

Coronary artery disease,7,52,Title: Late-Onset Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in a Non-obese  Non-smoking South Asian Male: A Case Report   Introduction:  A 65-year-old South Asian male presented with symptoms of persistent chest pain. The purpose of this report is to document the unusual presentation and course of his condition given his relative overall health and absence of major risk factors.  Patient Information:  Mr. A  a retired school teacher  grew up and resided in northern India until he retired two years ago  after which he relocated to the United States to live with his son. He reported having a well-controlled diabetic condition for the past 15 years but no history of hypertension  high cholesterol  or cardiovascular diseases. He had never smoked or consumed alcohol  and his diet was primarily vegetarian. His BMI was within normal limits (22.2 kg/m2). There was a family history of CAD with both his father and older brother who had been diagnosed above the age of 65.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient had tachycardia with an initial blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Cardiovascular exam demonstrated minor non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities on ECG. Blood analysis showed mildly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (130 mg/dL)  but other lab parameters—such as triglycerides  HDL cholesterol  fasting blood sugar (FBS)  and HbA1c—were within normal range. No evidence of infection was found in the blood cultures.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  The patient underwent exercise stress testing  which was positive for inducible myocardial ischemia. The subsequent coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending branch and 50% stenosis in the right coronary artery.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the angiographic findings  the patient was prescribed a regimen that included aspirin  a statin  and a beta-blocker. A decision for an elective coronary artery bypass surgery was made considering the extent of the disease and his risk factors.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient tolerated the CABG procedure well and exhibited adequate recovery over the subsequent week. He was discharged with instructions to follow a strict medication regimen and advised lifestyle modifications. In subsequent follow-ups  the patient reported decreased symptoms of chest pain and improved general well-being.  Discussion:  This case report underlines the significant risk of CAD in South Asians irrespective of classic risk factors such as obesity  a high-fat diet  and smoking. Genetic predisposition  combined with type 2 diabetes—a common condition in this demographic—may play an important role in CAD development. This calls for increased surveillance and primary prevention efforts  even in seemingly healthy individuals who don't exhibit traditional CAD risk factors.

He also has mild Hypertension  controlled with Hydrochlorothiazide and Atenolol for the last 5 years. There is history of smoking  roughly 1 pack/day for 35 years  but he quit 3 years ago. Patient is slightly overweight with a BMI (Body mass index) of 27. Reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Family history includes his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at age 67 and his older brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) at age 60. There is no known history of any familial hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Complaints: The patient visited the clinic with complaints of increasing episodes of exertional chest pain for the past 8 weeks. He describes the pain as a constricting discomfort localized in the center of his chest and occasionally radiating towards his left arm. He has also experienced episodes of shortness of breath post moderate physical activity.  Physical Examination: A thorough physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg and a resting pulse rate of 72 beats per minute. Chest auscultation was unremarkable. Examination of the cardiovascular system showed no signs of heart failure  with no peripheral edema or jugular venous distention noticed.   Investigations & Tests: An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at rest displayed minor ST-T wave changes. Blood tests were ordered which showed moderately elevated LDL cholesterol levels (LDL-C 180mg/dL) and raised fasting blood glucose levels of 140mg/dL. His HbA1c was 7.2%.   Given the history of chest pain and findings from the ECG  the cardiologist suggested doing a treadmill stress test  which showed ST depressions in the inferior and lateral leads during exercise. This suggested significant ischemia.  The patient was then referred for coronary angiography  which showed triple-vessel coronary artery disease with significant (>70%) stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD)  the right coronary artery (RCA)  and the circumflex artery (LCX).  Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical presentation  and results of diagnostic tests  the patient was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease with significant narrowing in 3 vessels - LAD  RCA  and LCX.  Treatment and Follow-up: The presence of significant three-vessel disease in this patient necessitates that he be considered for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). He was commenced on aspirin  a statin (Atorvastatin) for cholesterol control  and a beta-blocker (Atenolol). His diabetic medications were reviewed and continued. Lifestyle modifications were also prescribed including regular exercise  a healthy diet  and cessation of alcohol.   The patient  on understanding the severity of his disease  agreed to undergo CABG at the earliest convenience. For the same  he was referred to a cardiothoracic team. He was also referred for cardiac rehabilitation post-surgery to aid in his recovery and help reduce the risk of future cardiac events.   This patient’s diagnosis and treatment highlight the vital importance of early identification  suitable intervention  and suitable risk factor management in CAD.

Primarily targeted towards primary care physicians  this case detail serves to enhance recognition and appropriate management of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Patient Information: The patient is a retired long-time resident of New York City  living with his wife in an apartment. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 30-year history of smoking. He has had a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement and a self-reported diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables.  Clinical Findings: The patient complained of central chest pain which was usually precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. The character of the pain was often described as “pressure” or “squeezing” and sometimes associated with shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which he is on metformin and lisinopril  respectively. He has no known allergies. The patient has no prior surgeries and his family history is significant for CAD in his father who died at the age of 60.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission showed nonspecific ST segment and T wave changes. Lab results were significant for elevated cholesterol levels. The patient underwent an exercise stress test which demonstrated ST depressions indicative of myocardial ischemia.  Diagnosis: Considering the patient's clinical presentation  past medical history  and results from the investigations  he was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease.  Management and Follow-up: The patient was started on a beta-blocker  a statin for his elevated cholesterol levels  and aspirin as prophylaxis for his CAD. He was also advised to incorporate lifestyle modifications for risk reduction. These were to comprise a healthy balanced diet  regular physical activities  maintaining a healthy weight and continued abstinence from smoking. Patient was subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the extent of disease and to guide possible revascularization strategy.  Psychosocial Considerations: Given the associated risk of anxiety and depression in patients with CAD  mental health screenings and potential treatment referrals were recommended during follow-up appointments.  This case highlights the need for ongoing management and secondary prevention in elderly patients with coronary disease. Controlling risk factors with both lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions can help reduce disease progression and improve overall patient outcomes.
Coronary artery disease,7,64,Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who resides in a suburban community west of Chicago  IL. He is a retired mechanical engineer  currently living with his wife. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and has a 40-year history of smoking. He generally drinks alcohol socially  approximately two to three units per week.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  diagnosed when he was 50 years old  and hyperlipidemia  diagnosed a decade later. He has been on medication for both conditions. He has a family history of coronary artery disease  with his father having had a heart attack at the age of 60. The patient himself had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at the age of 65  and at that time underwent a triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He is also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and is taking metformin.  Presenting Problem: The patient came into the clinic complaining of chest pain radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath  which was exacerbated with exertion and partially relieved by rest. These symptoms have been occurring intermittently for the last two weeks. The patient states that he has experienced some nausea and diaphoresis (excessive sweat) during these episodes.  Investigation and Diagnosis: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T-wave inversion and ST elevation  suggesting myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography revealed significant coronary artery stenosis in the left main and circumflex coronary arteries. The right coronary artery graft was occluded  and the other two grafts from the previous CABG were stenosed. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60-65%.   In light of these findings  the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) was made  with angina pectoris due to multiple vessel disease and occluded grafts.  Treatment: A drug regimen was started  including aspirin  beta-blockers  and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Percutaneous coronary intervention was deemed too high risk due to the patient's age  severity of disease  and poor graft status. After discussing with the patient and his family  a decision was made for non-invasive management and lifestyle modifications.  The patient was advised to quit smoking  reduce alcohol consumption  and initiate a low-sodium  low-cholesterol diet. Regular exercise was recommended under the supervision of a cardiac rehabilitation team. Stress management was also advised.   The patient is scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor symptom progression and the impact of lifestyle changes on disease management.

Clinical Findings On examination  the patient had a BMI of 30 kg/m2  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  and heart rate of 76 beats per minute. Initial EKG showed minor ST-segment depressions in leads II  III  AvF  and V6. Laboratory findings revealed an elevated LDL cholesterol (180 mg/dL) and normal blood glucose levels and kidney function.   History The patient's medical history indicates incidents of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Her father had passed away due to a myocardial infarction at 67 years old. She has been on antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 5mg) and metformin for diabetes management. The patient reported adherence to pharmacotherapy but had a sedentary lifestyle with infrequent exercise and a diet high in carbohydrates and fats.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment The initial diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) was suspected based on symptoms  risk factor profile  examination findings  and history of premorbid conditions. To accurately assess cardiac function and confirm the diagnosis  she was referred to a cardiologist. Coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery  confirming the diagnosis.  Therapeutic Intervention Considering the patient's clinical history and current condition  the specialist advised a dual approach  comprising lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. She was prescribed statins (Atorvastatin 20mg)  antiplatelet (Aspirin 81mg) and ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril 10mg) for hypertension  adding to her existing medication profile. Lifestyle interventions include dietary modifications  adopting a structured exercise program  focusing on weight loss and good glycemic control.   Follow up and Outcomes The patient was followed up after 2 months. She reported improvements in her symptoms. Her blood pressure was down to 136/84 mmHg and an overall reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Despite this positive note  she still must continue with her treatment to manage the residual risk factors and ensure good cardiovascular health.  Conclusion This case emphasizes the high prevalence rate of CAD within the Hispanic/Latino population  especially among women  primarily due to commonly observed risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and familial history. The report underscores the necessity of a multifactorial approach to CAD management that integrates pharmacological intervention with lifestyle modifications  patient education  and early intervention to prevent disease progression.   Patient Perspective Regular exercises and dietary changes have helped me manage my symptoms of CAD. Persistent routine follow-ups ensured that I can monitor my health conditions better. As a patient  the importance of adhering to prescribed medication and lifestyle changes is comprehended.
Coronary artery disease,7,75,Case Report: A Sixty-Year-Old Hispanic Female with Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information:  The patient is a 60-year-old Hispanic female with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  who was referred to the Cardiology Department due to worsening anginal symptoms.  Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and is managed with Metformin. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were diagnosed 5 years ago  currently managed with Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) and Atorvastatin (Statin drug)  respectively. She is a non-smoker and denies any form of substance abuse. She adheres to a dietary plan consisting of low-sodium and low-cholesterol foods.  Family History:  The patient’s mother died at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction  and her father  aged 82  has a history of diabetes and stroke. Her older brother  aged 67  is currently being treated for angina.  Presenting Issue:  The patient reported experiencing moderate to severe chest pain radiating to her left arm over the past three months. The frequency and severity of the angina had increased over the past couple of weeks. Besides  she reported experiencing dyspnea on exertion. However  she denied experiencing associated symptoms such as syncope  palpitations  or dizziness.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination was largely unremarkable. The patient’s blood pressure was adequately controlled at 128/78 mmHg  heart rate- 82 beats/min  respiratory rate - 18 breaths/min  and body mass index of 28. The cardiovascular examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 without any additional heart sounds or murmurs. The chest was clear on auscultation and there was no peripheral edema.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed evidence of T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4  consistent with ischemic changes. Subsequently  coronary angiography was recommended  revealing significant stenosis (~70%) in the left anterior descending artery. A diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) was therefore confirmed.  Management and Follow-Up:  Considering her symptoms and results  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stenting was performed successfully. She was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and Clopidogrel)  along with continued Atorvastatin and Lisinopril. She was referred also for ongoing management of the risk factors for CAD  including dietary modification  exercise  weight reduction  and better glycemic control of her diabetes.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the particular importance in managing risk factors  notably hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes in populations with a high incidence of CAD  such as the Hispanic community. The American Heart Association recommends that adults aged 20 and older should have their cholesterol and other traditional risk factors checked every 4 to 6 years.  The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in three months' time. She has been advised to monitor her symptoms closely  and she was educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications  and when to seek immediate medical attention. A referral was also made to the Diabetes Education Center for the patient to better manage her diabetes in order to help prevent further development of CAD.

He is a current smoker with a 30-pack-year history  does not consume alcohol  and has a diet rich in red meat and processed food. He works in a high-stress job  has a BMI of 30.8  and reports irregular exercise habits. The patient was born and raised in Mexico City  and he moved to the USA 10 years ago.  Medical History  Diabetes was diagnosed 7 years ago  managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily. Blood glucose levels have been relatively stable with occasional fluctuations. Hypertension was diagnosed 5 years ago  treated with lisinopril 10 mg daily  and blood pressure readings have consistently been below 140/90 mmHg. Hyperlipidemia was discovered during a routine medical check-up 2 years ago. Following dietary modifications  the patient has been on atorvastatin 20 mg daily since then. No history of myocardial infarctions  strokes  or any other cardiac-related disease.  Family History  His father had undergone angioplasty  diagnosed with coronary artery disease at age 58  and his mother had type II diabetes. One of his two sisters has hypertension  and the other has no notable health issues.   Presenting Issue  The patient described his chest discomfort as a pressure-like sensation that generally initiates during physical exertion like climbing stairs or carrying heavy things and often gets relieved with rest. He also mentioned that he had similar instances in the past  but the frequency has increased within the last month.  Diagnosis and Treatment  An Electrocardiogram and Treadmill Test suggested possible coronary artery disease. Further evaluation with a Coronary Angiogram confirmed the presence of significant stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery.  The patient was prescribed an initial dose of antianginal medication (metroprolol 50 mg/day)  aspirin 100 mg/day  and advised to continue his antihypertensive  antidiabetic  and statin therapy. A consultation with a dietitian was arranged to provide the patient with a nutritional plan that involves low saturated fat and low sodium diet. He was further referred to cardiac rehabilitation for monitored regular exercise and smoking cessation program.  Patient education was also initiated regarding the importance of lifestyle changes  medication adherence  and periodic reviews.

Presenting Complaints:  The patient reported a three-month history of exertional chest pain that radiated to his left arm  usually triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest. He also experienced associated symptoms of shortness of breath  fatigue  and occasional episodes of lightheadedness.  Past Medical History:  Mr. B had been previously diagnosed with hypertension and Type-II diabetes mellitus. He had been managing these conditions with a regimen of Lisinopril and Metformin  respectively. He also has a 25-year history of smoking but quit five years ago.   Family History:  His father had a myocardial infarction at age 60  and his maternal grandfather had a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD).  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  Mr. B appeared comfortable at rest but became noticeably dyspneic following mild exertion. His blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg  pulse 80 bpm  and BMI 29 kg/m2. The remainder of the physical examination  including a respiratory and neurological examination  was unremarkable.  Investigations:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest revealed no significant abnormalities. However  a stress test showed ischemic changes  with ST-segment depressions noted in the inferior and lateral leads.   A subsequent coronary angiogram confirmed the presence of severe  three-vessel CAD involving the left anterior descending artery  the right coronary artery  and the left circumflex artery.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on sublingual nitroglycerin for his acute anginal symptoms  aspirin  and high-dose statins as secondary prevention for CAD. Due to the advanced  triple-vessel CAD shown in angiogram  he was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)  given the high risk associated with percutaneous coronary intervention due to extensive disease.   Discussion:  This case highlights common risk factors for CAD  including advanced age  male sex  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  and family history of premature CAD. This underscores the importance of regular cardiovascular screening and aggressive risk factor management among high-risk individuals. Further  patients with extensive CAD often necessitate revascularization via CABG  as seen in this case.   Follow-up:  Post-surgical follow-up was scheduled to evaluate the patient's symptomatology  reassess cardiac function post-CABG  and to adjust medications as needed. A comprehensive long-term management plan  including smoking cessation  dietary modifications  and regular exercise  was also discussed with the patient.   Conclusion:  Coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This case emphasizes the importance of meticulous risk factor optimization and timely management to improve outcomes amongst patients with CAD.

Coronary artery disease,7,99,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient's profile  The patient  a male  aged 67 years  currently residing in Maui  Hawaii  is of Asian descent. His occupational background involved moderate physical labor as a mechanic and currently leads a retired life occupied primarily by gardening  a relatively physically active hobby. His family history includes a history of heart disease  both parents suffering from cardiovascular issues.  Medical History  The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 10 years ago and has a history of hypertension for 15 years that is moderately controlled with medication. He is also being treated for hyperlipidemia  a condition that contributes to the progressive nature of CAD due to buildup of plaque in the arteries over time. He does not consume alcohol but has a history of cigarette smoking  a habit he discontinued five years ago. He reported difficulty in managing his weight  a standing challenge over the past decade.  Presenting Complaints  The patient presented with chief complaints of progressive exertional chest pain and episodes of shortness of breath during the past two months. He also reported occasional lightheadedness and general sense of fatigue. The symptoms were particularly pronounced during strenuous physical activities such as gardening and even after climbing a flight of stairs.   Investigations and Diagnosis  A series of diagnostic investigations were carried out. Resting electrocardiogram showed potential signs of myocardial ischemia. The stress test was positive for inducible ischemia. A coronary angiogram discovered critical lesions in the right coronary artery and severe stenosis in a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery. With this presentation and these investigations  he was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   A transthoracic echocardiogram reported a normal ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL and total cholesterol levels. Fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels were indicative of poorly controlled diabetes.  Treatment Protocol  Considering his advanced age  comorbid condition  and severity of coronary artery disease  the patient was recommended a comprehensive treatment plan of lifestyle modification  pharmacotherapy  and revascularization. He was put on a regimen of antiplatelet drugs  statins  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors.  In conclusion  this case reflects the prevalence and representation of coronary artery disease (CAD) as found in literature. Aging males  especially with existing conditions like diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia  are seen to be vulnerable cohorts. Moreover  past habits such as smoking further compound the risk factors associated with CAD.   This case report emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in disease management to prevent the onset of more complicated heart conditions. Maintenance of a heart healthy lifestyle  along with strict adherence to medication regimes offer the best chances against the progression of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,7,100,Case Report: A 59-year-old male presented with recurring angina pectoris and dyspnea for the past six months. The patient  of Caucasian descent  is an auto mechanic by profession residing in Nashville  Tennessee. He lives with his wife and one adult child in a suburban neighborhood. He has a past history of smoking  consuming 20 cigarettes per day for the last 30 years  but quit smoking after his first episode of angina seven months ago. He is a known alcoholic  yet tries to restrain consumption to avoid aggravating his symptoms.  Apart from the recent anginal episodes  the patient's past medical history includes type 2 diabetes  for which he has been on metformin and gliclazide for the past seven years. His diabetes management has been challenging  mainly because of the difficulty in maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise. He is in treatment for stage 2 hypertension  controlled with Amlodipine. Hypercholesterolemia was also noted four years ago.  Despite not having a family history of myocardial infarction  his parents were both hypertensive and diabetic. The patient  however  does not have any siblings.  The current symptoms of angina pectoris and dyspnea were episodic initially within the six-month period but became more frequent and severe two months prior to presentation. He attributed the discomfort to indigestion initially but as it worsened and became more recurrent  a visit to the local clinic revealed ischemic changes on the ECG  suggesting Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  On physical examination  the patient appeared slightly anxious  with the visible presence of orthopnea. His vitals revealed a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  pulse 90 beats per minute  respirations 16 per minute  and he's afebrile. A raised jugular venous pulse was observed. Cardiac auscultation revealed a clear first heart sound (S1)  a reduced intensity of the second heart sound (S2) along with an S4 gallop  and there were no murmurs. Chest examination revealed basal crepitations. The rest of the physical examination was insignificant.  Further investigations  including an echocardiogram and coronary angiogram  confirmed severe stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.   The patient was promptly started on a regimen of statins  beta-blockers  nitroglycerin for angina  and aspirin. An elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was agreed upon with the patient after a complete and candid discussion of his case.  The case highlights the classic presentation of coronary artery disease in a patient with multiple risk factors including smoking  alcohol consumption  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia.    This report emphasizes the need for early detection and management of modifiable risk factors in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease  which could have prevented the patient from progressing towards severe CAD requiring surgical intervention. It also adds to the reinforcement of implementing rigorous control of diabetes and hypertension  lifestyle and dietary modifications in managing CAD patients.

Coronary artery disease,9,1,Patient Case Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)   Patient's Profile: The patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 56-year-old African American male living in a residential suburb of Atlanta  Georgia. He is a former industrial production manager but had to retire due to health concerns. Mr. Smith is married with two adult children. He lives with his wife  and enjoys fishing during his leisure time.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension which was diagonised 12 years ago  type II diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago and hyperlipidaemia diagnosed 5 years ago. He has been compliant with medications  including amlodipine  metformin and atorvastatin. He quit smoking cigars ten years ago after being a steady smoker for about 25 years. He does not consume alcohol.  Family History: His mother passed away at the age of 70 due to complications from type II diabetes. His father had also suffered from hypertension and died following a stroke at age 75. His older brother  who's 59  was recently diagnosed with CAD as well.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith booked an appointment  after experiencing bouts of chest pain that often radiates to his left arm over the past two months. The pain typically lasts for about 5-10 minutes and has been more frequent in the past two weeks. Symptoms seem to increase with physical exertion  but he has also had episodes at rest. He mentioned that he has also been feeling unusually fatigued  experiencing shortness of breath  and occasionally dizzy.  Examination & Diagnosis: On examination  he had a BMI of 32 classified as obese and BP was 145/95 mm Hg. His ECG revealed ST-segment depression indicative of ischemia. An exercise stress test supported ischemic changes  and he was further referred for angiography. The angiogram showed a >70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and a 50% blockage in the right coronary artery consistent with the diagnosis of CAD.   Treatment: Mr. Smith was commenced on beta-blockers (Metoprolol) and antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin) in addition to his usual medication. He received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for revascularization of his coronary arteries.  Following the intervention  Mr. Smith was referred to a dietician and a physiotherapist to provide guidance on dietary changes  weight reduction  and a regular low intensity exercise regimen. He is doing well on this regimen as he follows up at the cardiology clinic.   Conclusion: This case exemplifies CAD presentation in a somewhat typical patient considering his age  gender  ethnicity  and comorbidities. Management was carried out in line with the standard guidelines for CAD. 
Coronary artery disease,9,2,Patient Presentation  Patient Identification: Mr. Smith Age: 62 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith presents with complaints of persistent chest pain with radiation to his left arm  shortness of breath  and increased fatigue over the past few weeks. The chest pain is often associated with exertion and relieved by rest.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia managed with Lisinopril  Metformin  and Statin therapy  respectively. He reports inconsistent medication adherence and suboptimal control of his blood glucose levels. Mr. Smith quit smoking ten years ago but had a 30-pack-a-year smoking history prior to quitting. He consumes alcohol moderately and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Smith is a well-nourished male  not in distress. His blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg  heart rate is 85 bpm  respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 95% in room air. His Body Mass Index is 30  suggesting obesity. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs  rubs or gallops  but the electrocardiogram displays T wave inversions in the anterior leads. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Lab Findings: His FBG (Fasting Blood Glucose) is elevated at 180 mg/dL  A1C is 8% and lipid profile reflects a high LDL cholesterol at 160 mg/dL. Troponin levels are obtained and are elevated.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 70 and his mother died from stroke at age 73. His elder brother underwent angioplasty at age 65.  Diagnosis: Based on his presenting symptoms  medical history  positive family history  ECG changes  and elevated troponin levels  a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is made.   Plan: Mr. Smith requires further tests including Echocardiogram and Coronary Angiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity. His medication regimen needs optimization to ensure better control of his hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Strong emphasis will be placed on lifestyle modifications  including dietary changes  moderate physical activity  and adherence to medications.   Discussion: CAD is the leading cause of death globally. Aging  sedentary lifestyle  tobacco use  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and family history are well-established risk factors. A multimodal plan combining diet  exercise  and medication adherence is imperative to improving CAD prognosis.
Coronary artery disease,9,3,Patient Presentation  Patient Initials: J.S.  Age: 67 years  Sex: M  Race: White  Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic  Past Medical History: Diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia five years ago  for which he takes medication.  Family History: Father died at 72 due to myocardial infarction. His mother lived to 85  but had long-term hypertension and diabetes. He has one older brother who was diagnosed with angina in his early 60s.  Social History: J.S. is a retired engineer who worked at a stressful job for 40 years. Smoked since he was in his early twenties  but quit 10 years ago. He admits to not exercising often  and a diet high in processed and fast food.  PRESENTING ISSUE J.S. presented to the clinic experiencing severe chest pain and difficulty breathing. The pain  radiating to his left arm  commenced while he was doing yard work. Earlier in the week  he reported feeling fatigued and having mild chest discomfort on exertion  which he attributed to old age and overworking.  CLINICAL FINDINGS Upon examination  J.S. appeared sweaty and short of breath. Blood pressure was elevated at 167/95 mmHg. Heart rate was irregular at 105 bpm. Blood tests showed increased troponin levels and lipid profile was abnormal with a total cholesterol of 250 mg/dl.  DIAGNOSIS The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation  indicative of myocardial ischemia. Based on the EKG findings  elevated troponin levels  history of hypertension  and reported chest pain  J.S. was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD)  specifically ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  TREATMENT J.S. was immediately administered aspirin and referred to the cardiology department for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He was also prescribed statins to manage his high cholesterol levels  along with a recommendation for lifestyle modification  including diet  exercise  and stress management.  DISCUSSION CAD is prevalent among older men  especially those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels. The patient's race (white) and ethnicity (non-Hispanic) also put him at a higher risk as CAD tends to be more common among these demographic groups. His family history  especially his father's myocardial infarction and brother's angina  further increased his CAD risk. His sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet also contributed to his CAD presentation. Immediate intervention through PCI was crucial in this case to restore blood flow to the affected artery  and prevent irreversible heart muscle damage. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and regular health check-ups  especially for those with risk factors for CAD.

He will follow-up with his primary care physician regularly to monitor his progress.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of recognizing the modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  a diet high in saturated fats  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia are all modifiable risk factors that the patient can change. Age  sex  and family history are non-modifiable risk factors for CAD. Regular follow-ups  patient education  and adherence to medications will help in the management of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,6,Patient Profile:   Mr. James Sutton is a 66-year-old Caucasian male residing in Houston  Texas. He has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He is a retired engineer  married with three children  all of whom are adults living independently.  Past Medical History:   James has a significant history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which have been managed for the past 15 years with medication. He is also treated for hypercholesterolemia. He had an MI (myocardial infarction) 10 years ago but sustained no significant cardiac damage. He is a former smoker  having quit 12 years ago  but smoked a pack of cigarettes each day for about 35 years.  Demographics:  James belongs to the demographic most affected by CAD: males over the age of 45  of Caucasian descent. Despite CAD affecting both genders  it is more prevalent in men  and the risk increases with age. Furthermore  Texas has one of the highest instances of CAD in the country  thus further increasing risk.  Family History:  Both of James’ parents had CAD. His mother  a heavy smoker and diabetic  had bypass surgery in her mid-sixties and lived until she was 79. His father had a fatal heart attack at the age of 65. Furthermore  James has a brother who had a stent placed at the age of 58.  Presenting Complaint:  James presented with progressive symptoms of atypical chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue over the last five months. The chest pain is predominantly exertional  relieved by rest and is not associated with any other symptoms such as nausea  palpitations  or sweating.   Examination & Diagnostic Testing:  On examination  James was slightly overweight (BMI 28)  had a blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg  and had regular pulses. An EKG showed T-wave inversions in leads V4-V6. Stress testing was positive for the inducible ischemic disease. Subsequently  a coronary angiogram revealed a significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.  Summary:  James  considering his advanced age  significant personal medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and important hereditary predisposition to CAD  he presents a classic case of CAD. His past myocardial infarction and recent symptoms following exertion suggest unstable angina  necessitating further diagnostic and therapeutic measures. James' case underscores the importance of risk factor management in patients with known CAD. Preventive lifestyle changes will also be crucial in managing his condition. His treatment plan will necessitate a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  dietetics  and potentially cardiac rehabilitation services.
Coronary artery disease,9,7,Patient: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Presenting Problem: Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  is presenting with symptoms of fatigue  mild chest pressure  and dyspnea. He notes a recent increase in these symptoms  causing him concern and prompting his visit.  Medical History:  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with moderate hypertension 10 years ago and manages it with lifestyle adjustments and occasional medication. He also has slight dyslipidemia and has been on statins for the past 8 years.   Patient Lifestyle: The patient is a former smoker who stopped about 15 years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol use and a sedentary lifestyle  despite recently trying to be more active. His diet was high in sodium and fat until about five years ago when he started making healthier choices.  Family History:  The patient’s father passed away in his early 70s due to a myocardial infarction  while his mother is alive at the age of 94 with no cardiovascular issues. Mr. Doe has one brother who is alive and healthy at 71.  Recent Tests: The patient's electrocardiogram shows mild ST depression  indicating possible ischemia. His lipid panel shows a total cholesterol of 210 mg/dL  HDL of 41mg/dL  and LDL of 133 mg/dL. Lastly  his blood pressure is slightly elevated at 143/85 mmHg.  Assessment:  Based on his history  exam  and recent test results  Mr. Doe is identified with a high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). His family history of cardiovascular disease  combined with his former smoking  moderate hypertension  dyslipidemia  and advanced age  all contribute to this risk.   Plan: A possible plan for Mr. Doe could include referral to a cardiologist for a possible angiogram and further evaluation since the ECG is indicating possible ischemia. His hypertension should be closely monitored and medication may need to be optimized. He should continue with his improved dietary choices  increase his physical activity  and possibly discuss a plan with a dietician or physical therapist. Regular monitoring of his cholesterol levels is also important. It would also be important to keep an eye on his mental health since a CAD diagnosis may create stress  and counseling should be offered if needed.   This case presentation is based on the understanding that Caucasian males  especially those over 65  have significantly higher rates of CAD as compared to other demographics. LDL cholesterol levels above 130 mg/dL also indicate higher chances of developing CAD. Previous lifestyle choices like smoking and unhealthy diet can be significant contributors to this condition too. Factors in the patient's favor include his cessation of smoking  improved dietary habits and use of statins. Still  decreasing alcohol consumption  increasing physical activity  and more aggressive management of his hypertension could be beneficial to him.
Coronary artery disease,9,8,Patient Presentation  Patricia Smith is a 62-year-old African American female with a medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and obesity who comes into the clinic presenting symptoms consistent with chronic stable angina. Her symptoms include experiencing chest discomfort  especially with exertion  shortness of breath  fatigue  and sometimes dizziness. She admits that episodes are often triggered by stress or physical activity but are relieved with rest. The episodes last about five minutes.  Her past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus which was diagnosed eight years ago  and for which she takes Metformin. She has been dealing with hypertension for over ten years  controlled with Lisinopril  and has struggled with obesity (BMI of 32) for much of her adult life. She also has dyslipidemia managed with a statin. She is a non-smoker  but she admits to maintaining a diet high in saturated fats  and lacking regular physical activity due to her demanding job as a corporate accountant.   Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her father having died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 66  and her older sister diagnosed with coronary artery disease at 64.   Diagnosis and Conclusion:  Patricia Smith's symptoms  combined with her family history and lifestyle risk factors  suggest a high likelihood of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The chronic stable angina indicates possible underlying CAD. Given her risk factors of obesity  a diet high in saturated fats  lack of physical exercise  hypertension  diabetes and dyslipidemia  it is likely that atherosclerotic plaque formation has occurred  causing narrowing of the coronary arteries leading to the aforementioned symptoms.   CAD is prevalent among African American women  particularly those in their sixties which is consistent with Patricia's demographic. Moreover  the presence of multiple comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension increases the risk of CAD  which is why comprehensive and regular management of these chronic conditions is crucial. Patricia should be referred for further diagnostic investigations  including an electrocardiogram (EKG) and potentially an angiogram to confirm the diagnosis  and a detailed plan for lifestyle modifications and treatment should be developed to manage her condition effectively.
Coronary artery disease,9,9,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. J  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the clinic feeling tired  experiencing occasional chest pain and shortness of breath after physical activities. He is a retired teacher residing in Gary  Indiana  living with his wife. Mr. J's BMI is 30  indicating that he falls in the obese category. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement five years ago and loves to eat deep-fried foods.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of high blood pressure and borderline diabetes  which he manages with medication and minor lifestyle modifications  including gradual changes in his diet and intermittent physical activities.  Family History: He has a family history of heart disease  where his father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 58  and his elder brother was diagnosed with CAD at the age of 60.   Diagnostic and Lab Tests: Upon examination  Mr. J’s blood pressure was recorded at 140/95 mm Hg  and his resting pulse rate was 88 beats per minute. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed some non-specific changes while a treadmill stress test suggested a possible CAD. A subsequent coronary angiogram confirmed significant blockages in two major coronary arteries.  Diagnosis: Mr. J was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Discussion: Mr. J's case presents a typical profile for CAD  given his demographics. Individuals of African-American descent  such as Mr. J  have higher rates of heart disease compared to other ethnicities in the United States. His age also puts him at risk  as heart disease is common in men aged 60 and older. Moreover  his lifestyle and dietary habits  along with a sedentary routine  have resulted in obesity  another high-risk factor for CAD. His high blood pressure  borderline diabetes  and family history of heart disease further exacerbate his risk for CAD.   Plan:  Mr. J was recommended aggressive risk-reduction therapy that involved lipid-lowering medications and dietary modifications. He was also referred to a supervised exercise program to help him settle into a healthier routine  in addition to a cardiac rehabilitation program to help manage his heart disease. As he presents multiple risk factors for CAD  the need for a careful  holistic  and personal approach to his disease management was emphasized. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor his health status and adjust treatments as necessary.

Presenting Problem: Mr. Garcia presented with complaints of chest discomfort and shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity and eases with rest. These symptoms have been ongoing for approximately six weeks.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has a documented past medical history of Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has been moderately compliant with his medication  Metformin  and a Thiazide diuretic for the last ten years.  Family History: His paternal grandfather  father  and one of his brothers died from myocardial infarctions before reaching 70 years. His mother died of stroke at 75 years. He has two siblings who were diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes  similar to him. His three children are currently healthy with no known illness.  Physical Examination: Mr. Garcia's blood pressure was 165/95 mm Hg and his pulse was 82 bpm. He was overweight with a BMI of 28. Laboratory values showed elevated LDL cholesterol levels and HbA1c levels suggestive of poorly controlled diabetes. EKG suggested ischemic changes.  Diagnosis:  Given the presentation  past medical history  and test results  Mr. Garcia was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   Treatment and Recommendations: Mr. Garcia was prescribed a beta-blocker  Lisa’s aspirin  and a statin. He was counseled on the importance of medication adherence  regular exercise  a well-balanced diet (limiting sodium and saturated fat intake)  prioritizing weight management  and monitoring his blood pressure and blood sugar levels at home. He was also made aware of the increased risk his children face due to the strong family history of CAD  diabetes and hypertension  and urged that they get regular check-ups and monitor their lifestyles closely.  This brief case reflects the demographics found in literature  indicating a high prevalence of CAD among Hispanic individuals  particularly males  with comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and obesity. Family history is also a significant risk factor for CAD development. Strategies to manage CAD focus on controlling these risk factors through lifestyle changes and medical treatment.
Coronary artery disease,9,12,Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  named Mr. Williams  a retired government official  living in Boston with his wife.   Medical and Family History:  Mr. Williams has a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). His father passed away at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction  and his elder sibling has been living with CAD for the past five years. He is currently diagnosed with coronary artery disease himself. His past medical history includes hypertension and Type II diabetes which have been managed over a span of 15 years through medication and dietary adjustments.  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Williams visited the hospital after experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain over the past month  more severe during physical exertion and relieved by rest. He also reported a shortness of breath on doing routine activities and even waking up at night feeling breathless.  Diagnostic Procedures:  He has undergone an electrocardiogram (ECG)  stress test  and coronary angiogram to confirm his diagnosis of CAD. His ECG shows abnormal heart rhythms and ST-segment depression. The angiogram indicated significant blockage in his left anterior descending artery.  Lifestyle:  Mr. Williams was a heavy smoker in his younger years and has a history of alcoholism  but has cut down significantly on both in recent years. His diet consists mainly of high cholesterol and high sodium food. His Body Mass Index is 31 - in the obese range.  Treatment Plan:  The medical team is considering a coronary angioplasty procedure with stent placement to treat the blocked artery. He will also require lifelong medication for cholesterol and blood pressure management  and antiplatelet drugs to prevent clot formation.   Future Recommendations:  Mr. Williams is strongly recommended to make drastic lifestyle changes  including adhering to a heart-healthy diet  maintaining a healthy weight  regular exercise  refraining completely from smoking and alcohol  and regularly monitoring his blood sugar and pressure levels.  Demographics Similarity:  The profile of Mr. Williams is consistent with literature that places African American males above 60 with family history of CAD at an increased risk of developing the disease. Obesity  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol are all contributing risk factors  which moreover overlaps with the prevalence of CAD in African American populations in the US.   Conclusion: The comprehensive management of Mr. Williams' coronary artery disease involves a combination of invasive treatment  medication  as well as strong emphasis on lifestyle modifications. It also necessitates accurate self-management of his comorbid hypertension and diabetes. Routine follow-ups and a strong patient-physician relationship can contribute towards effective management of his health condition.

Coronary artery disease,9,17,Patient Presentation:  Patient Details: Mrs. X is a 67-year-old African American woman  who was brought into the clinic by her daughter due to experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath  chest pain and fatigue  which she had initially taken for symptoms of old age. She lives in an urban setting and is a retired school teacher. She has been a widow for the last 7-8 years and lives with her daughter who has a 9 to 5 job.   Medical History: Mrs. X is diabetic (Type II  controlled through diet and Metformin)  and has high blood pressure managed by Lisinopril 20mg daily. She has had no past surgeries or known allergies. She has a history of long-term cigarette smoking  although she quit 10 years ago.   Family History: Her father passed away due to a myocardial infarction in his early 60s and her mother died of complications related to hypertension and stroke in her late 70s. She has a younger brother who has been living with coronary artery disease (CAD) for about five years.  Recent Consultation: Upon evaluation  Mrs. X was observed to have uncontrolled hypertension and was advised lifestyle changes  including dietary improvement and increased physical activity  in addition to her daily medications. Due to her symptoms and family history of heart conditions  a complete cardiac evaluation was recommended.   Investigations and Diagnosis: The results from her electrocardiogram and further testing such as CT angiography showed stenosis in two of her coronary arteries  leading to her diagnosis of CAD. Her lipid profile also showed slight elevation above normal range  further icreasing the risk for atherosclerosis.  Due to this  the doctors have started her on statins and have reinforced more aggressive  better controlled management of her hypertension and diabetes. She is now enrolled into a cardiac rehabilitation program focused on exercise training  education for heart-healthy living  and counseling to reduce stress while quitting smoking.  Prognosis: With appropriate medications  the control of the underlying conditions  and modifications in her lifestyle  Mrs. X can control her symptoms and slow down the progression of her disease. Her family is supportive  but considering her age  comorbidities  and family history  she will continue to be at moderate risk for a cardiac event like angina  myocardial infraction  or cardiac death and will require diligent follow-up care.  Mrs. X represents the typical demographic group  as according to the CDC  coronary artery disease is more prevalent among African American individuals and more common in women over the age of 65. Moreover  the typical risks factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and a history of smoking are also very common in CAD patients.

It is crucial to form a treatment plan keeping in mind the patient’s age  comorbid conditions  and socioeconomic status.   Figure References: Based on the incidence rate among African American men aged 60-79  which is approximately 7.1% as reported by the American Heart Association.
Coronary artery disease,9,24,Patient Details:  The patient  Mr. A  is a 59-year-old Latinx male currently residing in Jackson County  Oregon. He is a nonsmoker and categorizes his alcohol consumption as light. Prior to this diagnosis  Mr. A has been doing well  with no significant past medical history  except for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which have been managed through medication and lifestyle modifications since their diagnoses 8 years and 5 years ago  respectively.   Family History:  Mr. A has a family history of heart diseases. His father died of coronary artery disease (CAD) at age 66  and his older sister  currently age 62  has recently been diagnosed with CAD.   Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis:  Mr. A presented to the clinic with complaints of on and off left-sided chest pain radiating to his left upper limb for the past couple of months. EKG indicated some abnormalities  suggesting possible ischemic heart disease. Further cardiac workup  including cardiac catheterization  confirmed the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The coronary angiogram showed significant narrowing of his left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.    Disease Management:  Mr. A has been placed on medications such as aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins as part of his long-term management. He is also advised to continue with a strict diet  regular exercises  and to manage his blood pressure and sugar levels to reduce future cardiac events. He is referred to a dietitian for hospital-diagnosed diabetes and a care plan is discussed to manage these conditions with Mr. A and his family.  Discussion:  Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) has a reported incidence of 6.7% in the U.S. It is well documented that a higher risk of CAD exists among individuals above fifty years of age  males  and those with a family history of CAD. Considering Mr. A is a 59-year-old male and has a family history of CAD  these factors made him a potential candidate.   The role of comorbidity in CAD is also important. Common comorbidities such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes  found in Mr. A  significantly increase CAD risk. Attention to these comorbidities and therapeutic management will be crucial in his case.   Culturally competent care tailored to Mr. A's personal preferences  needs  and values should be considered. Guidelines recommend a comprehensive approach to Latinx patients with CAD  including lifestyle modifications and heart-healthy diet planning  given existing disparities in health outcomes for this population.  While this brief case presentation has focused on Mr. A's CAD  his hypertension and type 2 diabetes should not be ignored  especially given the interplay between these conditions and CAD. Optimal control of these conditions will be crucial in managing Mr. A's CAD and in reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

He resides in a low-income neighborhood in Detroit  Michigan. Given his race  age  and geographical location  he is considered to be at higher risk for CAD.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history. He has been hypertensive for the past 15 years and has been managing it with medication. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  for which he takes metformin. The patient is also a former smoker who quit 10 years ago but smoked one pack a day for 35 years. Additionally  he is obese with a BMI of 35 and does not exercise regularly. His diet is heavy in processed and fast foods due to his limited income and access to fresh foods in his community  which is a known food desert.  Family History: There is a robust familial history of cardiac disease. The patient's father died of a massive heart attack at the age of 64  and his older brother suffers from angina. His mother also had a history of hypertension and died from a stroke at 72.  Presenting Symptoms and Tests: The patient came for consultation  complaining of intermittent chest pain  especially during exertion  over the past month. He also reported episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue. He seemed anxious due to his family history. An ECG showed ST-segment depression suggestive of ischemia. The physician decided to perform a cardiac catheterization  which confirmed the presence of significant obstructions in his coronary arteries  leading to the diagnosis of CAD.  Diagnosis and Treatment Plan: The patient was diagnosed with coronary artery disease based on his presenting symptoms  history  and the cardiac catheterization result. Given the advanced disease  treatment options include lifestyle changes  medication  and possibly coronary artery bypass grafting. The doctor also referred the patient to a dietitian to help manage his weight and diabetes.  Follow-ups and Expected Prognosis: As CAD is a chronic illness  the patient will require consistent check-ups and medication adjustments  especially if surgery is elected. The prognosis depends on several factors  such as the patient's adherence to the proposed lifestyle changes  the degree of obstruction in the coronary arteries  and the presence of other co-morbid conditions.  Patient's Perspective: Despite his initial anxiety  the patient seems motivated to manage his condition. He expressed a strong desire to avoid the fate of his father. With proper management  he should be able to prevent further progression of the disease.

Coronary artery disease,9,27,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient works as a retired teacher and resides in Phoenix  Arizona  with his spouse.   Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with CAD 10 years ago. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he takes medication. Five years back  he suffered a mild myocardial infarction  following which a stent was placed in his right coronary artery. Post-procedure  he has been adhering to recommended lifestyle modifications  including a low-salt  low-fat diet  regular physical activity  and smoking cessation.  Family History:  There is a strong family history of heart diseases. His father died of a heart attack in his late 60s  and his elder brother  70  has undergone angioplasty for CAD. His mother  who passed away at age 88  had a diagnosis of hypertension.  Social History:  Mr. Smith was a previous smoker  having quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally. He also has minimal physical activity and follows an irregular diet pattern  mostly of high-calorie fast foods.  Clinical Details:  Currently  Mr. Smith presents with complaints of recurrent chest pain on exertion  noted more frequently over the last month. The pain is relieved with rest and nitroglycerin but seems to be progressively worsening. He also admits to fatigue and shortness of breath on performing daily activities.  Conclusion:  Given his past medical history  family predisposition  his recurrent symptoms  and risk factors  CAD is a major concern. Mr. Smith needs immediate attention to optimize his current therapy for angina and discuss the possibility of further invasive interventions  like repeat angioplasty or even coronary bypass surgery  as necessary. Counseling regarding healthier lifestyle choices needs to be reinforced.  Notes:  Case presentations are an important part of medical education and practice  contributing to improved patient care. A comprehensive case presentation includes detailed patient information  their complete medical  social  and family history  details of clinical presentation  any interventions  and follow-up strategies.  The demographics in the case presentation have been guided by epidemiological trends seen in literature  regarding CAD. CAD is more common in older adults  predominantly men and those of Caucasian descent are known to have a higher risk of CAD. Additionally  risk factors such as smoking  alcohol  and a sedentary lifestyle have been recognized as crucial in the development of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,28,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Jones  is a 65-year-old African American male who presents with complaints of ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath  especially on exertion. He was previously diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes for which he is currently taking appropriate medications.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years back and managed with Metformin  hypertension for the past 7 years controlled with Lisinopril  and a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit about a decade ago. He has no known allergies. His last known lab readings show elevated LDL levels (160 mg/dL) and HbA1c of 7.5%.  Family History:   In his family history  both his father and paternal uncle suffered from myocardial infarctions in their mid-50s. His mother had a history of stroke. His older brother is living with coronary artery disease.  Lifestyle:  Mr. Jones is a retired auto mechanic  married with two children. He lives with his wife and enjoys mostly sedentary activities  with minimal physical exercise involved. He admits to a diet high in processed foods and a history of heavy alcohol use.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  he is obese with a BMI of 30.5  blood pressure is moderately elevated at 145/90 mmHg despite his medication  heart sounds are normal but pulse is slightly fast at 95 beats/minute  and there are no signs of heart failure such as fluid retention. An ECG in the office showed ST-segment depression suggestive of possible ischemia.   The patient was subsequently sent for a coronary angiogram which confirmed a significant blockage in the left anterior descending artery confirming the diagnosis for coronary artery disease.  Given his age  gender  race  medical history of diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  family history of early coronary artery disease (CAD)  physical inactivity  and poor diet  Mr. Jones falls into the high-risk category for coronary artery disease as per the American Heart Association. He has since been advised for revascularization.   In addition to addressing the CAD directly through possible intervention  a plan has been made to optimize his diabetes control  further manage his hypertension  assist with weight loss and encourage a more active lifestyle to help manage his risk factors. His case shows the importance of considering the complete patient profile in evaluating the risk for coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,9,29,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Ahmed is a 65-year-old African American male who was recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He visited our department with complaints of intermittent chest pain  especially during exercise or stress  which is relieved by rest.  Demographics:  According to various research  African American males have a higher risk of developing CAD. It has also been found that the median age for a first heart attack in men is 65. Physically  Mr. Ahmed is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. Moreover  studies have proven the risk of CAD increases with age and is more frequent in males particularly post-menopause.   Past Medical History:  He has a known case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  controlled on anti-hypertensives and metformin for the past 10 years. His lipid profile revealed high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  and he has moderate chronic kidney disease.  Family History:  Mr. Ahmed has a significant family history of cardiac diseases; his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 67  and his older brother was diagnosed with congestive heart failure at the age of 70.   Lifestyle:  He is a retired construction worker and leads a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. He confessed to have been a heavy smoker until his retirement at 60. He admits to occasionally consuming alcohol and following a diet high in red meat and low in fruits and vegetables.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he was found to have a BMI of 31 kg/m2  blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg  heart rate 76 bpm  respiration 16 breaths per minute. He shows signs of peripheral edema but no jugular venous distension. Heart sounds were regular but murmur was present. Pulmonary examination showed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with crackles on the right lower lobe.  Based on the patient's symptoms  history  physical examination and laboratory investigations  the diagnosis of CAD was made. He was advised to make lifestyle modifications and was added on a beta-blocker  aspirin  statin  and nitroglycerin for immediate relief from anginal chest pain. He is scheduled for cardiac stress testing and a possible angiogram to evaluate the extent of CAD.   In conclusion  Mr. Ahmed's advanced age  family history  long-standing DM and HTN  sedentary lifestyle  prolonged smoking history  high BMI and high LDL levels all predispose him to CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,30,Case Presentation  Mr. Johnson  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  presented complaining of intermittent chest pain over the last two months. The chest pain was typically brought on by physical exertion and relieved by short periods of rest. He also reported shortness of breath following minimal exertion and occasional bouts of lightheadedness.  He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which have been controlled with medications: amlodipine for hypertension and atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia over the last six years. Mr. Johnson also has a long history of smoking one pack per day for over 25 years  but quit a year ago.  Family history is significant for early onset of coronary artery disease (CAD). His father had a myocardial infarction at 55  one of his brothers suffered a stroke at 60  and his other brother was newly diagnosed with angina pectoris. At the time of presentation  Mr. Johnson was living alone since his wife passed away four years ago  and has two grown children who live in another city.  On examination  Mr. Johnson was a well-built man with a body mass index (BMI) of 26. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. There were no abnormal findings on physical examination. His blood tests revealed elevated levels of total cholesterol  Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol  and triglycerides.  Given his symptoms suggestive of angina pectoris  his risk factors for CAD (positive family history  previous smoking  hypercholesterolemia  hypertension  and age)  as well as physical and laboratory findings  a preliminary diagnosis of CAD was made. Mr. Johnson was referred for further investigations including an electrocardiogram (ECG)  echocardiography  and coronary angiography. If the diagnosis was confirmed  a comprehensive management plan consisting of lifestyle modifications  regular physical activity  dietary changes  medications for CAD  and possibly coronary intervention would be initiated.  Compared to available statistics  Mr. Johnson's details are fairly typical for CAD. The literature indicates that the highest rate of coronary heart disease is found in older men  especially from the Caucasian race. Mr. Johnson's smoking  hypertension  elevated cholesterol levels  and family history all contribute to his risk of CAD  as is common for patients with these characteristics.  In conclusion  Mr. Johnson represents a typical patient at high risk for CAD. By recognizing this and initiating appropriate investigations  healthcare providers can diagnose and manage CAD promptly  thereby improving patient outcomes.
Coronary artery disease,9,31,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male  named Mr. Johnson who was recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He has been experiencing chest pains that were initially mistaken for indigestion. However  after repeated episodes  he decided to consult his primary care physician  who referred him to a cardiologist based on his complaints and his medical history.  Past Medical and Family History:  Mr. Johnson's medical history includes Controlled Type 2 Diabetes for the past ten years and hypertension. His father died from a heart attack at 72 years of age while his mother passed away in her late 80s due to complications from diabetes and age. His elder brother had bypass surgery at the age of 65. Two of his three children have been diagnosed with hypertension in their 40s.  Lifestyle:  Mr. Johnson is a retired veteran who led an active life until the age of 60. He was a regular smoker up to his 50s and even though he quit smoking 15 years back  the duration of his smoking years might have contributed to CAD. He admits that he has gained weight in the past few years  due in part to a more sedentary lifestyle. He lives with his wife in the city and their children often visit them.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  he was overweight (BMI of 29) with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. His lipid profile showed increased LDL levels. EKG findings revealed T wave inversions in the inferior leads. The Treadmill Stress Test was positive at a relatively low workload  suggesting significant CAD. Subsequent Coronary Angiography confirmed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary arteries.  Given the extent of his disease and his risk factors  i.e.  being a male  his age  his ethnicity  his family history of Cardiovascular disease (CVD)  a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension  his sedentary lifestyle  and obesity  it is also important we work on his lifestyle along with CAD management. Mr. Johnson was advised a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  weight reduction strategies  smoking cessation  and to limit alcohol intake.   Mr. Johnson’s case is a typical example of CAD in African American males which represents populations disproportionately affected by this disease  as shown in the literature. His family history  personal history of smoking and obesity  along with other comorbidities have likely all contributed to his recent diagnosis.
Coronary artery disease,9,32,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rivera  a 60-year old Hispanic male  arrives at the clinic  complaining of increasing bouts of chest pain and fatigue for the past three weeks. He described the chest pain as a heavy  squeezing discomfort that primarily occurs during physical exertion and diminishes when he rests.  Past Medical History:  He has managed hypertension for the past five years  and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed two years ago. His current medications include Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. He has a 30-pack year smoking history and quit 8 years ago. He has a BMI of 30  indicating obesity. His preventive screenings  such as colonoscopy and annual physicals  have been well maintained.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 74 from an apparent heart attack  and his mother  who is 83  has a history of stroke. His older brother  who is 65  experienced a myocardial infarction three years ago  and his younger sister  age 58  was recently diagnosed with hypertension.  Social History:  Mr. Rivera is a retired civil engineer  married with two adult children. He consumes alcohol occasionally  mostly on weekends. He has a steady diet  which he admits is often high in fat and salt  primarily due to his preference for traditional Hispanic foods. He lives in an urban area and acknowledges he lacks regular exercise  attributing this to a busy schedule and lack of nearby recreational amenities.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs reveal blood pressure of 140/95 mmHg  heart rate of 82 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 per minute  and BMI 30 kg/m2. Cardiovascular examination reveals no murmurs or gallops  but borderline bradycardia is noted.  Diagnostic Tests:  EKG shows evidence of possible prior infarction  but no acute changes. Lab results indicate increased LDL cholesterol levels (160 mg/dl) and HbA1c of 7.2%. Given his symptoms and risk factors  he was recommended for an exercise stress test. Significant ST depressions were seen on the monitor during the test  suggestive of myocardial ischemia.  Diagnosis:  Combined with his symptoms  risk factors  EKG results  and abnormal stress test  Mr. Rivera is diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Treatment:  Given the stress test findings  he is scheduled for cardiac catheterization  with possible angioplasty or bypass surgery. He is also recommended a change in diet to reduce LDL cholesterol  increased exercise  weight management  diabetes optimization  and strict control of hypertension. A consultation with a dietitian and a diabetic educator is arranged to assist him in lifestyle modifications.
Coronary artery disease,9,33,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  an African American male aged 65  is recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).   Medical History: Mr. Doe is known for Hypertension (HTN) since the last 10 years and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) since the last 5 years. He has a history of heavy smoking for the past 30 years  although he quit five years ago. There are no records of any previous surgical interventions or hospitalizations. He is currently under medication for HTN and T2DM.  Physical Examination: At presentation  his blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  pulse rate 78 beats per minute  and body mass index was 30 kg/m2 (classified as obese).

Coronary artery disease,9,34,Patient Case Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information:  Mr. J  66-year-old Caucasian male  retired high school teacher  currently living with his wife in a small Southern California town.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J approached his primary care physician with recent onset substernal chest pain mainly during physical exertion  which subsides upon rest.   Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of hypertension  managed through lifestyle interventions and oral anti-hypertensive medication (Lisinopril). His profile includes controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin. He occasionally takes OTC antacids for gastroesophageal reflux. He had an appendectomy at age 27 and knee replacement 3 years ago.  Social History: Mr. J admits to having a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He quit smoking 15 years ago after being a pack-per-day smoker for 25 years. He drinks wine socially and denies any illicit drug use.   Family History: Heart disease is prevalent in Mr. J’s family. His father died from a heart attack at age 70. Mr. J's older brother  aged 70  has been living with coronary artery disease for 10 years and his maternal uncle also had stroke at age 62.  Medications: Daily Lisinopril 10mg for hypertension  Metformin 500 mg BID for diabetes  and an aspirin as recommended by his primary physician for his reported chest pain history.  Physical Examination: In general  Mr. J appears to be a moderately overweight male. His BMI is calculated at 28 mg/kg². Blood Pressure reading on presentation was 144/92 mmHg  pulse 80  respiration 18. All other physical examination parameters appear normal.  Initial Investigation: An ECG showed ST segment depressions indicative of possible ischemia. Further  blood tests showed elevated cholesterol levels. A stress test was scheduled  then later myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary catheterization were performed  confirming the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  Discussion: Given the classic presentation of exertional angina  along with his significant history of cigarette smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of CAD  and type 2 diabetes  Mr. J was considered to have an extremely high pre-test probability for coronary artery disease.  Plan: Mr. J was started on a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  Statin (Atorvastatin) and low-dose aspirin on top of his anti-hypertensive and diabetes medication. Lifestyle modifications including dietary changes  increased physical activity  stress management  and regular appointments with a cardiologist were advised. He was educated on the warning signs and symptoms related to a cardiac event and advised to seek medical attention immediately if these arise. Further interventions including angioplasty or CABG will be considered depending on the progression of his disease.  This case represents a fairly typical presentation of a high-risk patient diagnosed later in life with coronary artery disease  a disease which forms the largest share of cardiovascular disease burden in mature adults.
Coronary artery disease,9,35,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Initials: J.D. Sex: Male  Age: 67 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Bank Manager Insurance: Medicare  J.D is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presented with discomfort in the chest  shortness of breath  and fatigue. He complained of these symptoms occurring mostly during physical exertion and subsiding while at rest. He was previously diagnosed with Hypertension five years ago  for which he has been taking antihypertensive medication. He is also a former smoker and quit smoking about 15 years ago after a 20-year habit. J.D is overweight (BMI: 28).  Family History His father died from a heart attack at the age of 62  and his mother had a history of stroke. His older brother  aged 72  had percutaneous coronary intervention two years back.  Physical Exam On examination  his blood pressure was noted to be high  with readings 145/90 mmHg. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. His lower legs were slightly swollen.  Investigations EKG results showed ST-segment depression. His lipid profile reports were as follows: Total cholesterol: 260 mg/dL  LDL: 170 mg/dL  HDL: 35 mg/dL  Triglycerides: 300 mg/dL. Fasting blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL. The stress test was positive for myocardial ischemia.  Diagnosis Based on the presenting symptoms  family history  physical examination  and investigation results  J.D was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Plan J.D. was advised to continue with an antihypertensive medication plan  started on a statin for dyslipidemia  and advised on adopting a low cholesterol diet. He was also prescribed low-dose aspirin for platelet aggregation and beta blockers for the chest pain. For the CAD  it was decided that coronary angiography would be conducted to decide to further proceed with either medication or intervention. Counseling was also provided on lifestyle modifications like regular exercise and weight reduction.  This case exemplifies the commonly perceived demographic representation for coronary artery disease: older age  male  and Caucasian. Factors such as smoking  a positive family history of heart disease  hypertension  and high cholesterol further increase the risk.  REFERENCES: 1. Benjamin EJ  Muntner P  Alonso A  et al.

Coronary artery disease,9,36,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient Information:  Mr. X is a 62-year-old African-American male diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He is a retired schoolteacher  is married  and has two adult children. He resides in an urban area. Mr. X has a history of hypertension  for which he takes 10mg Lisinopril daily  and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago. His BMI of 28.5 classifies him as overweight—specifically  heights of 6 feet with a weight of 210lbs. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but has a 20 pack-year smoking history.   Family History: There is a significant cardiovascular history in the family. His father had a myocardial infarction at 55 and died at the age of 63 due to stroke. His mother has hypertension  and his older brother  currently 65  underwent angioplasty at the age of 59. There is no family history of diabetes.  Presentation: Mr. X's primary complaint is intermittent chest discomfort occurring mainly during exertion over the past six months and progressively getting worse. He has been experiencing fatigue more quickly and has shortness of breath during his routine walks. He reports no episodes of syncope or palpitations.   Diagnostic Evaluation: An ECG showed evidence of previous myocardial infarction. The lipid profile indicated elevated LDL (170 mg/dl) and low HDL (32 mg/dl) levels. HbA1c was 7.8%  indicating suboptimal control of diabetes. A stress test was performed  which he could not complete due to chest discomfort  and it demonstrated significant ST-depression in the inferior and lateral leads.   Treatment: Mr. X was advised to undergo coronary angiography due to the high likelihood of severe CAD  which confirmed the presence of significant disease. A detailed discussion with Mr. X and his family regarding options for treatment took place  and he agreed for the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).   Discussion: Early identification and management of risk factors is crucial. The literature reveals significant disparities in CAD incidence and outcomes  which may predispose Mr. X to an increased risk of CAD due to multiple factors such as his race  age  family history  and personal medical history.   The implication of patient’s race in this case is particularly significant as literature shows that African Americans are more likely to have multiple risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes for CAD. Furthermore  they also experience higher rates of morbidity from the disease. In such cases  a comprehensive approach involving lifestyle modifications and rigorous control of risk factors is ideally advised.
Coronary artery disease,9,37,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Smith  a 60-year-old African-American male  presents with complaints of intermittent chest discomfort and shortness of breath with exertion over the past month. Born and raised in the U.S.  he has worked as a lawyer for 35 years  a career characterized by high stress levels and a sedentary lifestyle. He is married with three adult children. He self-reports a 20-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day  sparing alcohol use  and no illicit drug use.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension diagnosed ten years ago  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed five years ago. Both conditions are fairly well managed through diet  oral medication  and lifestyle modifications. His most recent HbA1c was 7.0% and his BP typically records around 130/85 mmHg. He does not have any history of surgeries or hospitalizations.  Family History: Mr. Smith's father died at the age of 55 due to myocardial infarction  while his mother  currently 82 years old  suffers from hypertension. His eldest brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at 55 years old  and his maternal grandfather died of a stroke.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Smith is an overweight male and appears fatigued. His blood pressure is 145/95mmHg. His pulse regular  and his respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 20 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are normal  and there are no peripheral edema or carotid bruits.   Laboratory Findings: His lipid profile revealed an elevated total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL (optimal <200 mg/dL)  elevated LDL cholesterol level of 160 mg/dL (optimal <100mg/dL)  and reduced HDL cholesterol of 35 mg/dL (optimal >60mg/dL). Other routine lab findings were unremarkable  including kidney function and liver function tests.   Diagnosis: Considering the patient’s history  clinical examination  and lab results  a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is made. As an African-American male over the age of 60 with a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular disease  Mr. Smith falls into a high-risk category for developing CAD.  Management: Mr. Smith is advised about the seriousness of his condition. Management will involve lifestyle changes  medication  and possibly procedures if necessary. He is referred to cardiology for further evaluation and management.  This brief case illustrates the common risk factors and clinical presentation of coronary artery disease. The patient's advanced age  race  lifestyle factors  and co-morbid conditions have all contributed to the development of this common  but serious  cardiovascular disease. Regular follow-ups and effective management of his established risk factors will be vital in controlling disease progression and preventing adverse cardiovascular events.

Coronary artery disease,9,40,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Harold Thompson Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian  Gender: Male Residence: Urban Area  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Thompson presented to the clinic with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath  especially after moderate exertion  for the past six months. He also reported occasional episodes of dizziness and palpitations.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a known history of hypertension for 15 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years. His hypertension is controlled with Lisinopril and diabetes is managed with Metformin. Mr. Thompson is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history but quit smoking 5 years ago. He enjoys a few beers every weekend and does not do regular exercise.  Family History:  His father had a myocardial infarction at 62 years old and his mother had a stroke at the age of 67. He has one sibling  a brother  who was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) at the age of 59.  Physical Examination:  On inspection  Mr. Thompson is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. His blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg and his heart rate is regular  but slightly fast at 87 beats per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals soft S1 and S2 with no obvious murmurs.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment depression. Blood tests indicated slight elevation in cardiac enzymes and poor blood glucose control (HbA1c: 8.0%). A nuclear stress test exhibited reversible myocardial ischemia suggestive of CAD.   Management:  He was referred to a cardiologist and subsequent coronary angiography confirmed the presence of significant stenosis in two major coronary arteries. Mr. Thompson was then treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and a drug-eluting stent was placed in the stenotic sites of the arteries. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and Clopidogrel)  a statin (Atorvastatin) for atherosclerosis progression control  and his antihypertensive treatment was optimized with the addition of a beta-blocker (Metoprolol).   Discussion: The clinical symptoms  ECG findings  and angiography results confirmed the diagnosis of CAD in Mr. Thompson. Our patient represents a typical CAD risk profile  being a male over 60 years with long-standing hypertension  diabetes  a smoking history  and a positive family history. His obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and alcohol consumption further elevated his risk. Management is directed towards symptom relief  slowing disease progression  and preventing complication with lifestyle changes and pharmaceutical interventions.   Therefore  it’s vital for Mr. Thompson to implement lifestyle modifications such as losing weight  regular exercise  a healthy diet  strict blood glucose control  limiting alcohol consumption  and yearly flu vaccines. He will be closely followed up in the clinic  and his medications will be adjusted as per his symptoms and laboratory findings.
Coronary artery disease,9,41,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. J  is a 65-year-old African American male with a recent diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Mr. J's situation requires keen medical attention due to the high prevalence of CAD among the African American population.   Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of hypertension for the last 15 years  poorly controlled despite being on antihypertensive medication  including hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. His BMI is 30.2 (indicating obesity)  has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed seven years prior  and has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years  smoking at least one packet of cigarette a day.  Family History: Mr. J's family history is significant  with his father succumbing to an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 58  and his elder brother diagnosed with CAD at 60 years.  Presenting Complaint and Investigation: Mr. J presented with exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort for six months  which has been progressing. He denies any associated symptoms such as diaphoresis  nausea  or syncope. On examination  he had elevated blood pressure  averaging 150/90 mm Hg  along with signs of left ventricular hypertrophy on EKG. His labs showed a slightly elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c of 7.3%  indicating poor control of diabetes. His lipid profile was abnormal with elevated LDL and total cholesterol levels.  A stress test was positive  indicating a significant block in one of his coronary vessels confirmed by a coronary angiography showing a 75% blockage in the circumflex artery. Hence a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) was made.  Management: Considering the significant blockage  Mr. J was advised to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery. Concurrently  his medication regime was revised to aid better control of his hypertension  and high cholesterol levels with addition of statins and metoprolin for BP control and reduction of cardiac workload. Counseling was done regarding the importance of adhering to medications  smoking cessation  and the incorporation of lifestyle changes including diet modification and regular exercises.   Conclusion: Mr. J's case is a typical representation of how uncontrolled hypertension  poor management of diabetes  chronic smoking  and a positive family history expose a patient to the risk of developing CAD. CAD is a leading cause of death worldwide  especially in African Americans  making Mr. J's case a crucial one for understanding the correlation between chronic conditions and ethnicity. Monitoring  controlling risk factors  and adhering to a healthy lifestyle are crucial in managing CAD. 
Coronary artery disease,9,42,Case Presentation  Patient Information:   Mr. J.P.  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic. He had previously been working as an elementary school teacher but has been retired for the last two years. His body mass index is 26.8  which puts him in the overweight category. Mr. J.P. is a non-smoker and reports to have a moderate exercise frequency. He drinks alcohol sparingly. He is married  has two children  and lives in a suburban neighborhood.  Medical History:  Mr. J.P. has been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years and has been controlling it well through diet  moderate exercise  and Metformin. Besides  he was diagnosed with hypertension six years ago that has been effectively managed using Enalapril. He has no history of surgical procedures.  Family History:   His mother died at age 74 following complications from heart failure. His father also had cardiovascular problems and passed away from a heart attack at 65. His elder brother  aged 63  was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) five years ago but has it under control with medication and lifestyle changes. Mr. J.P. has no family history of respiratory or psychiatric illnesses.  Current Presentation:  Mr. J.P. attended the clinic today  complaining of moderate  intermittent chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and neck over the past few weeks. The discomfort usually erupts during physical exertion and alleviates with rest. Symptoms are worsened with stress. He reports shortness of breath and faint episodes of dizziness.  Assessment:  Given the patient’s age  family history of cardiovascular disease  chronic hypertension  diabetes  and presenting symptoms  a provisional diagnosis of coronary artery disease is considered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated ST-segment depression  and blood tests showed blood glucose slightly above the recommended limit  elevated LDL cholesterol  and normal HDL cholesterol levels. A stress test was also performed  confirming ischemic heart disease.  Plan:  The patient was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management  including consideration for coronary catheterization and possible revascularization. Pending specialist evaluation  a conservative management strategy was initiated  including aspirin  a statin (atorvastatin)  and an anti-anginal drug (Metoprolol). Patient education was reinforced concerning diet  regular exercise  smoking cessation  and medication compliance. Appropriate follow-up schedules were arranged.
Coronary artery disease,9,43,Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: John Smith Age: 65 Gender: male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: retired engineer Location: San Francisco  California  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  which is currently managed with ACE inhibitors. He was also diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  for which he takes Metformin. He has a history of smoking for 40 years (1 pack per day)  but quit 5 years ago. Furthermore  he reports episodes of angina  particularly on exertion  for the past 6 months.  Family History: His father died at 60 from myocardial infarction  and his mother suffers from hypertension. He has one older brother who is living and has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. These factors put Mr. Smith at a higher risk of falling to cardiovascular diseases.  Present Illness: The patient was admitted to the hospital after experiencing chest pain while mowing his lawn. An ECG was performed and revealed ST-segment elevations in leads II  III  and aVF  consistent with a diagnosis of an inferior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Blood tests showed elevated troponin levels. Consequently  he underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of his right coronary artery which had a 90% stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was successfully implanted.  Discussion: Mr. Smith's presentation is not uncommon for an individual with his risk factors. His decades of smoking  together with a familial history of early heart disease  plus his own history of hypertension and controlled type 2 diabetes  all significantly contribute to his risk of coronary artery disease. His chest pain on exertion (stable angina) and STEMI are serious  but common  acute complications of coronary artery disease.   Treatment Plan: Post-PCI  he was initiated on dual antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  statins  and advised to maintain rigorous blood glucose control. Lifestyle modifications that incorporate a healthy diet  regular exercise  careful monitoring of blood pressure  and maintaining a healthy weight were also emphasized upon. The importance of a support network  such as cardiac rehabilitation programs  was also discussed.  Long-term Outlook: Although coronary artery disease is a chronic condition  with the right lifestyle modifications and medication management  Mr. Smith can live a full and active life. Regular follow-up with his primary care provider and cardiologist to manage his heart disease and co-morbid conditions is essential.   Risk Factors and Prevention: As Mr. Smith has experienced  the key risk factors for coronary artery disease include smoking  chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes  as well as genetic predisposition. Avoidance of smoking and careful management of existing chronic diseases can go a long way in preventing coronary artery disease. Regular exercise  maintaining a healthy weight  and healthy eating can also minimize the chances of developing this disease.
Coronary artery disease,9,44,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 62-year-old African-American male  was admitted to the clinic complaining of chest discomfort and shortness of breath during minor physical exertion like climbing stairs or carrying groceries. These symptoms have been reportedly increasing in intensity for the past several months. Mr. Smith also reported episodes of light-headedness but denied any known history of syncope.   Medical History:  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  for which he has been managing with Metformin. He also has a 30-year history of smoking but quit five months ago. He has a history of hypertension  controlled by Hydrochlorothiazide and Lisinopril. Mr. Smith has a BMI of 29; hence  he is classified as being overweight. He has not been actively participating in any regular exercise and has an unremarkable diet.  Family History:  His father had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and died at age 70 from a myocardial infarct. His paternal grandmother also had hypertension and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in her late seventies.  Findings and Assessment:  Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure reading at 148/90 mm Hg. His body mass index of 29 is an indication of overweight  which could exacerbate his cardiac risk. His cardiovascular examination showed a regular rhythm with a rate of 72 beats per minute with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Lab findings showed HbA1C as 7.5%  indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Total cholesterol was 220 mg/dL  LDL 150 mg/dL  HDL 35 mg/dL  and triglycerides were 250 mg/dL  hinting towards Dyslipidemia. An exercise stress test was ordered due to his symptoms and risk profile  which indicated significant ST depressions in leads II  III  and aVF.  The overall clinical findings and investigations are in line with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  Plan:  Due to the positive stress test and associated symptoms  patient was referred for coronary angiography to confirm diagnosis and determine the need for possible stenting or CABG. Further  medications were adjusted for better management of his diabetes and dyslipidemia. The patient was strongly advised lifestyle modifications including a heart-healthy diet  regular aerobic exercise  weight loss and continued abstinence from smoking.  This patient's case underlines the need for anticipatory screening and aggressive risk factor modification  particularly in African-American men with a family history of coronary artery disease  type II diabetes  smoking history and hypertension.

Family History: Mother passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and a father diagnosed with stroke at 72 but is still alive. One older brother suffers from obesity and angina  while a younger sister is healthy.  Clinical Findings: During physical examination  weight was 210 lbs and height was 5'8""""  equating to a BMI of 31.9 (clinically obese). Blood pressure recorded was 145/92 mmHg. Auscultation revealed quieter than normal heart sounds. Lab investigations revealed elevated cholesterol levels (LDL=160mg/dL) and HbA1c level was 7.3%.  Diagnosis: Combined information from medical history  lifestyle  family history  and lab results leads to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).  Course of Action: Referral to a cardiologist for Cardiac Angiography to confirm the diagnosis of CAD. Given the patient's significant risk factors including increased age  race  hypertension  diabetes  elevated cholesterol levels  obesity  family history and lifestyle habits (smoking  sedentary lifestyle)  it's crucial to manage those risk factors along with implementing a treatment plan for CAD which may include medications  cardiac rehabilitation  and lifestyle modifications. The patient's family should also be encouraged for routine check-ups considering the history of CAD.  This case presentation reflects the demographics and risk factors for CAD as found in literature. Studies have shown that African American populations along with risk factors - such as a family history of heart disease  smoking  obesity  hypertension  diabetes - significantly increase the likelihood of developing CAD."
Coronary artery disease,9,46,"Patient Case Presentation on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male with a background in middle-income employment  now retired. He has a history of hypertension  diagnosed ten years ago  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed five years ago. His mother died of myocardial infarction at 68  and his father had similarly been diagnosed with CAD. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but had a 20-year pack history. He carries a body mass index (BMI) of 32  indicating obesity. He also reports a lack of physical activity and admits to a diet high in saturated fats.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain on exertion for the past three months  which he describes as a dull pain in the middle of his chest. He also reported accompanying symptoms of fatigue  mild shortness of breath  and occasional bouts of dizziness. The chest pain usually resolves with rest within 10 minutes. He categorically denied any symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or sweating during these episodes.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Electrocardiography (ECG) at rest was normal  but a treadmill stress test induced angina and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia at a moderate level of exercise. Lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 270 mg/dL  with an LDL level of 180 mg/dL. HbA1c was 7.5%  indicating poorly controlled diabetes.  Management:  The patient was started on pharmacotherapy  including statins for dyslipidemia  antihypertensive medication  aspirin for antiplatelet action  and sublingual nitroglycerine for immediate relief from angina. His poor control over diabetes was addressed  and he was counseled on a healthy lifestyle  including a low-salt  low-cholesterol diet  regular exercise  and the importance of regular follow-up.  This case illustrates the importance of risk factor modification  early detection  and strict treatment of hypertension and diabetes in preventing or slowing the progression of CAD. This experience reemphasizes the relevance of health promotion activities such as regular physical activity  healthy diets  and cessation of smoking.  Reference:   Patient case scenarios were altered to fit a demographic profile found in literature (Yancy CW.  Cardiovascular disease in African Americans  Heart Failure Clinics  2018). “Blacks are 20% more likely to die from heart disease than whites  and at any age  they're 50% more likely to die of heart disease or stroke."""""
Coronary artery disease,9,47,Patient Case Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Introduction: Mr. R.S.  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the cardiology clinic with complaints of chest pain. He describes the pain as uncomfortable pressure  fullness  pain  squeezing  or discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes.  Demographics: According to the American Heart Association  African-American males have a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) due to the combination of genetic traits  lifestyle choices  and healthcare access issues. Mr. R.S. is unemployed and resides in a socio-economically disadvantaged part of the city.  Past Medical History: Mr. R.S. has a known history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a smoker with a 30-pack year history and is clinically obese. He admits to a poor diet and sedentary lifestyle.  Family History: His father died from a massive myocardial infarction at the age of 58. He has two elder brothers  one of whom has a history of ischaemic heart disease while the other one is hypertensive.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. R.S. is afebrile  with a blood pressure reading of 155/90 mmHg  heart rate of 85 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 95% at room air. He is overweight with a BMI of 35. His cardiovascular examination reveals no murmurs. He displays no cyanosis or clubbing and his chest is clear on auscultation.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows typical findings of CAD: ST-segment depression in leads II  III  aVF  and V3-V6. His lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol (250mg/dl)  LDL (high)  HDL (low)  and triglycerides. His HbA1c level is 7.8%.  Diagnosis: Based on his risk factors: age  gender  race  family history  smoking  hypertension  elevated lipid levels  diabetes mellitus  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle  his presenting symptoms  and the findings on ECG  a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease was made.  Treatment: He was initiated on the appropriate pharmacological treatment for CAD which includes a beta-blocker(metoprolol)  a statin(atorvastatin) for cholesterol  an ACE inhibitor(lisinopril) for blood pressure  low-dose aspirin for antiplatelet effect and a nitrate for the relief of angina.   In addition to pharmacotherapy  Mr. R.S. was advised of the importance of lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  dietary changes  regular exercise  and weight reduction.  Conclusion: Mr. R.S. is a clinically representative case of CAD as seen in older  African-American males with multiple risk factors. His case underscores the importance of risk factors identification  early diagnosis  effective treatment  and lifestyle modification in the management of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,48,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old African-American male  presents to the clinic  complaining of chest pain  characterized by pressure-like discomfort and slight shortness of breath  which he's been experiencing for the past few weeks. The pain typically develops with exertion and improves with rest.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of Type-2 diabetes mellitus (controlled with Metformin)  hypertension (under control with Lisinopril)  and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol levels  currently on Simvastatin). He's a former smoker but quit 10 years ago; however  he has a 20 pack-year history. He denies any history of previous surgeries or other significant illnesses.   Family History: He has a strong family history of heart disease. Both his father and paternal uncle succumbed to myocardial infarctions in their early sixties.   Lifestyle: He is a retired teacher  living with his wife. His lifestyle is fairly sedentary and his diet is predominantly high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables.   Physical Examination: On examination  his BMI is 31 kg/m2 (suggestive of obesity)  blood pressure is 145/95 mmHg  heart rate is 78 beats per minute  and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination reveals no significant abnormalities - there's no evidence of heart murmurs or extra sounds  and the rhythm is regular.   Based on the symptomatology  past medical history  and family history  the patient was suspected of having coronary artery disease (CAD) and hence underwent further diagnostic testing.   Diagnostic Evaluation: He underwent an exercise stress test  which revealed ST-segment depressions  suggesting possible ischemia. This was further confirmed by a coronary angiography  which exhibited significant stenosis in his left anterior descending artery.   Based on his risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  strong family history  a previous history of smoking  obesity  and race (the prevalence of CAD is more in African-Americans)  clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation supports the diagnosis of coronary artery disease  and immediate medical intervention was suggested to prevent any future cardiac events.  Plan: A multi-disciplinary approach involving lifestyle modification  control of risk factors (intensification of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia control)  medications (aspirin  beta-blocker  nitrate)  and revascularization strategies (percutaneous coronary intervention) was discussed. He was also referred to a dietician and physical therapist for optimized diet plans and a physical activity regime. Psychological counseling was emphasized to help deal with stress which could potentially exacerbate CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,49,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient  Mr. Arnold Mickelson  is a 72-year-old Caucastic male who is recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He resides in Miami  Florida  with his wife and is now retired from his 35-year career as a construction worker. He has presented at the hospital in recent years due to acute shortness of breath and new-onset angina.  Past Medical History: Mr. Mickelson is a patient with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications and statins for the past 15 years. He was a chronic smoker  consuming approximately 2 packs of cigarettes a day since he was 25 years old but quit smoking 10 years ago. He does not have a known history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Family History: There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away suddenly at the age of 63  reportedly from a heart attack. He has two older brothers  both of whom are living with CAD and have had interventional procedures (angioplasty) for the same. His mother lived to 80 and had hypertension and diabetes.  Clinical Presentation: The patient has reported experiencing mild chest discomfort and shortness of breath during physical exertion. These symptoms typically dissipated during periods of rest. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms have escalated over the last month.  Physical Examination: The patient's BMI is 30  indicating moderate obesity. Vital signs are reportedly stable  with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a pulse of 85 bpm  and respiratory rate of 20 per minute. Heart auscultation reveals no murmurs  and bilateral pulmonary fields are clear on auscultation as well.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) taken at the time of complaining of chest pains shows ST-depression and T-wave inversion  significant for ischemia. The lipid profile demonstrated elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Given the escalating symptoms  family history of CAD  and test results  the diagnosis of CAD was made. He was considered for further evaluation for possible myocardial revascularization.   This presentation of the patient aligns with clinical epidemiology  which suggests that the age range with the highest percentage of individuals with heart disease is 60-79 (28.5% for males)  and the highest prevalence of CAD in the U.S. is among white males. His risk factor profile  including male sex  older age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking history  and family history of CAD  is consistent with well-documented risk factors for CAD.  Treatment Plan: He was started on a regimen of beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  aspirin  and high intensity statins. A consultation with a dietician was suggested for obesity  nutrition  and weight loss counselling. In addition  a Cardiology intervention consult was recommended for possible angioplasty or bypass surgery. He was educated about the disease process  importance of medication compliance  and benefits of a healthier lifestyle. Regular follow-ups were arranged for clinical monitoring of his disease progress and lifestyle modifications.

No apparent physical abnormalities were seen. ECG showed ST-segment depression suggestive of myocardial ischemia. After a series of diagnostic tests including cardiac biomarkers and coronary angiogram  John was diagnosed with CAD.  Treatment Plan:  John was recommended to continue his existing medication and he was prescribed low-dose aspirin  a statin (to manage cholesterol levels) and a beta blocker to help reduce his blood pressure and relieve his angina. He was also advised to follow a Mediterranean-style diet (rich in fruits  vegetables  whole grains and lean proteins) and to incorporate regular physical activity in his routine  strictly advised to start cardiac rehabilitation as soon as possible. Follow up visits every 2 months were scheduled to monitor his condition closely.     Educational Interventions:  Explained the seriousness of the disease and discussed its common risk factors such as poor diet  sedentary lifestyle  and inconsistent blood pressure management. Emphasized the importance of regular follow-ups and adherence to the prescribed medications.  Overall  John's case highlights the importance of comprehensive assessment and timely intervention in managing patients with CAD. As he has several risk factors  such as his age  sex  family history  and history of hypertension and diabetes  it is critical for him to actively participate in managing his condition and preventing disease progression.
Coronary artery disease,9,52,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 62-year-old African-American male  presented to the clinic in late January with complaints of recurrent chest discomfort and episodes of shortness of breath during his usual activities. He said these episodes mainly occur during his early morning walk and frequent heavy lifting at his office. He mentioned that rest usually relieves the pain.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history significant for hypertension  which is currently managed with Lisinopril 10mg daily  and type-2 diabetes mellitus  managed with Metformin. He was diagnosed with both hypertension and diabetes 10 years ago. His last recorded HbA1c in September was 7.5. Mr. Smith’s BMI is 28.4  placing him in the overweight category. He has a 20-year history of smoking but quit 2 years ago.   Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his mother died at 78 due to stroke. He has one elder sister who had a triple vessel disease  and she underwent a CABG at the age of 62.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  He was afebrile  HR 88  BP 145/92. His cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rhythm  normal S1  S2  and no audible murmurs. The standardized respiratory  GI  and extremities exams were normal.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given the symptoms and family history  he was sent for labs and an ECG  which revealed mild ST depressions. His lipid profile showed high levels of LDL (155mg/dL) and triglycerides (220mg/dL). The findings raised suspicion for significant coronary artery disease (CAD). A subsequent treadmill stress test confirmed the diagnosis by demonstrating significant EKG changes with exercise  which resolved at rest.   Plan:  The cardiology team decided to manage his case conservatively with dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and Clopidogrel) along with a high-intensity statin (Atorvastatin). The patient was advised to avoid strenuous physical activities and to continue with a low salt  low cholesterol diet for his hypertension and to follow up in the clinic in two weeks for reassessment.   Discussion:   African-Americans are at greater risk for CAD due to a higher prevalence of hypertension  diabetes  obesity  and physical inactivity. Mr. Smith not only falls into this high-risk group but also has significant family history  making his CAD risk even worse. Management of this patient's condition should focus on lifestyle changes  strict control of diabetes and hypertension along with pharmacotherapy for CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,53,**Patient Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease**  **Demographics:**  Our patient is a 68-year-old African American male  retired and living in an urban environment with his partner. He is a former smoker  having ceased around 20 years ago  and drinks alcohol rarely. He leads a sedentary lifestyle  and has a BMI classified as overweight at 27. He served in the military during his younger years but has not been engaged in regular physical activity due to joint ailments.   **Past Medical History:**  The patient has a medical history of dry type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with metformin  and well-controlled hypertension on lisinopril. There is also a history of osteoarthritis in the knee. The patient denies any sleep abnormalities but admits to occasional periods of stress and feelings of anxiety. The patient went into early retirement due to increasing joint pain associated with osteoarthritis.   **Family History:**  There's a significant family history as his father passed away at age 62 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother had hypertension. His elder brother  age 72  suffered a stroke 3 years ago.   **Presenting Complaints:** The patient reported recent onset  intermittent chest discomfort over the past few weeks  especially when walking up stairs or doing some physical work  but the discomfort relieved at rest. The pain was mid-sternal  radiating to his left arm  without any associated dizziness  nausea  or shortness of breath.   **Physical Examination:**  Physical examination revealed BP: 140/90 mmHg  HR: 76 bpm  Resp: 16/min  BMI: 27. Cardiovascular exam demonstrated an S4 heart sound but no murmurs  rubs or gallops.   **Investigation:**  An electrocardiogram showed T wave inversion. Following an elevated troponin level on labs  the diagnosis of unstable angina was made. Subsequent coronary angiography demonstrated triple-vessel disease.   **Diagnosis:**  Our patient was therefore diagnosed with Coronary artery disease. He was stabilized with nitroglycerin and then referred for coronary artery bypass grafting.  This is a classic presentation of stable angina transitioning into unstable angina  showing that despite good control of his comorbidities  the interplay of his sedentary lifestyle  family history and previous smoking habit increased considerably his susceptibility to coronary artery disease. He'll need future lifestyle modifications post-surgery for a better prognosis.
Coronary artery disease,9,54,Patient Presentation  Patient Details:  Age: 65  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer.  Presenting Concern:  The patient presents to the clinic for a routine physical examination. He reports occasional episodes of angina  characterized by a feeling of pressure and chest pain during exercise  which dissipules at rest. Recently  these episodes have become more frequent and intense.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  managed with medication. He is also a chronic smoker  with a 40 pack-year smoking history. Until 5 years ago  he was sedentary but now regularly walks for exercise.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died from a heart attack at the age of 70  and his older brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Information:  The patient's blood pressure is found to be elevated at 150/90 mmHg. His BMI is within the normal range  but he has high cholesterol levels (LDL cholesterol is 170 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol is 35 mg/dL). An electrocardiogram (ECG) during a treadmill stress test revealed ST-segment depression indicative of myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography showed significant blockages in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient's symptoms  family history  and diagnostic findings  he is diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Management:  In addition to lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  diet improvement  consistent physical activity  he is prescribed Beta-blockers to manage his angina and high blood pressure  and Statins to control cholesterol levels  and low-dose aspirin for antiplatelet action. Patient is referred to a cardiologist for further management  including consideration for percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.  This case demonstrates a typical presentation of coronary artery disease in an older  Caucasian male with risk factors including a strong family history of heart disease  high cholesterol  hypertension  chronic tobacco use  and physically inactive lifestyle until recent years. The patient's symptoms are a classic depiction of angina  the type of chest pain associated with coronary artery disease which results from decreased blood flow to the heart.

Coronary artery disease,9,56,Patient Identity: Mr. John Doe  Demographics: John is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He lives in the urban suburbs of California and is a retired mechanical engineer. He is a widower and lives alone.  Presenting Concerns: John has been experiencing episodes of chest pain and discomfort  primarily upon exertion. During his last visit to his primary care doctor  they suggested conducting an electrocardiogram (EKG) due to his symptoms and his risk factors for heart disease.  Past Medical History: John has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he has been managing for 15 years. He struggles with obesity and has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago after smoking one pack a day for 30 years.  Family History: There is a significant family history of heart disease. John's father died of a heart attack at the age of 67. John's elder brother  67  was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. His mother is 80 and suffers from osteoporosis.  Medications: John is on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril) and oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin) for his existing conditions. He is also on a statin (simvastatin) for high cholesterol.  Examination Findings: On examination  John appeared comfortable at rest. His vitals showed a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  heart rate of 75 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 98%. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 30. Heart auscultation revealed normal heart sounds without any murmurs.   Diagnostic Evaluation: Considering the above findings  John's primary care doctor ordered an EKG  which showed some abnormalities. A following stress test was positive for signs of ischemia. Angiography revealed one of the major arteries  the left anterior descending artery (LAD)  was blocked about 70%.   Diagnosis: John was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) based on his symptoms  family history  lifestyle factors  and diagnostic tests.   Management: John's doctor has started him on additional medication (aspirin and a beta-blocker) and has recommended a diet/exercise regimen to control his cholesterol and obesity. Regular follow-ups were scheduled and the possibility of angioplasty in the future was discussed  considering the extent of blockage in his LAD.  The case of John Doe is a common representation of a significant portion of patients with CAD in the United States—older  Caucasian males with unhealthy lifestyle factors (smoking  lack of exercise  and poor diet leading to obesity  hypertension  and diabetes). His case also emphasizes the importance of considering family history in early detection and management of CAD.     Reference: Benjamin EJ  Muntner P  Alonso A  et al.

Coronary artery disease,9,57,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Profile: Mr. J.S.  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic reporting symptoms of angina experienced over the past three weeks. He was previously seen in this clinic for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both conditions being managed well with medication (Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes).   Detailed History: J.S. reported the chest pain initially as a mild discomfort but has gradually become more frequent and intense  typically showing up during physical exertion. The discomfort is constricting in nature  located in the center of his chest  and sometimes radiates to his left arm. It usually lasts for about 10 minutes and is relieved by rest. He has also noticed episodes of shortness of breath. J.S. admits to being a smoker for approximately 35 years  with an average of 15 cigarettes a day. He also has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Family History: On obtaining a detailed family history  he reveals that his father had a myocardial infarction at age 62  and his elder brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in his late forties.   Clinical Findings and Investigations: Physical examination was generally unremarkable except for elevated blood pressure (145/90 mmHg). BMI was calculated and showed an overweight status (BMI 28 Kg/m2). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T wave inversions indicating myocardial ischemia. Subsequent exercise stress test showed positive for inducible ischemia  and a coronary angiogram showed significant obstruction in the left anterior descending artery (LAD)  suggesting a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  Summary: In summary  Mr. J.S.  a 58-year-old Caucasian male with a strong familial predisposition to CAD  hypertension  and a long history of smoking and type 2 DM  presents with angina and shortness of breath. He has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease following diagnostic imaging and is currently being evaluated for therapeutic interventions.    The findings from the case report  the hypertension and diabetes  two conditions known to increase CAD risk  and family history of CAD  placed him at an elevated risk. This correlated with a report by the American Heart Association that coronary artery disease risk increases with age and is more common amongst men  especially those with a family history of heart disease.   Plan: An interdisciplinary approach to managing his coronary artery disease is essential. Medications are necessary  like antiplatelet drugs  statins  beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and nitroglycerin  along with lifestyle modifications. Mr. JS needs counseling on quitting smoking  limiting alcohol consumption  maintaining an active lifestyle  and adhering to a heart-healthy diet. Reassessment of diabetes management might also be necessary. It is also vital to assess the patient's emotional state as CAD diagnosis can often lead to anxiety and depression.

Chief Complaint:  John presented to the Cardiology clinic with complaints of chest pain which he describes as """"constricting"""" in nature and radiating to his left arm. The pain has been intermittent and mainly comes during periods of physical exertion such as walking and climbing stairs.   Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at 75  and his elder brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease at age 70.  Clinical Data:  Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  raised cholesterol levels (LDL-200 mg/dl  HDL- 32mg/dl)  and a fasting glucose of 150mg/dl. His ECG shows ST segment depression  and his treadmill stress test is positive for myocardial ischemia.   Diagnosis:  Given the patient's clinical presentation  past medical history  and family histories of heart disease  John has been diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Management Plan:  The management plan involves both lifestyle changes and medication therapy. Lifestyle modifications including cessation of smoking  dietary changes to a heart-healthy diet  and moderate physical activity are recommended. Medications prescribed include statins to lower cholesterol levels  ACE inhibitors to manage hypertension  antiplatelet to prevent blood clotting  and nitrates to alleviate chest pain.    Summary:  This case represents a typical presentation of CAD  given the patient's age  gender  demographic  smoking history  and comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension  which are all risk factors for CAD. His family history further increases his risk."
Coronary artery disease,9,59,Patient Presentation  Mr. A.B.  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Demographics  Mr. A.B. is an urban dweller living in the east sector of Atlanta  Georgia. He is a retired postal worker  married with three children  and has a modest income.  Medical History  Generally  Mr. A.B. has enjoyed good health until recently. His history  however  reveals diagnoses of mild hypertension diagnosed ten years ago and Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed five years ago. Both conditions are managed through medication and lifestyle modifications.  Family History  Mr. A.B.'s father passed away at the age of 71 from a heart attack  later discovered to be due to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). His mother  now 88  has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His older sister  68  recently had a stroke  and his younger brother  59  has diabetes.  Present Illness  For the past two weeks  Mr. A.B. has experienced episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath. These episodes usually occur on exertion and ease at rest. Recently  the frequency and intensity of pain have escalated  at times waking him from sleep.  Physical Examination  Upon examination: blood pressure 145/92 mmHg  pulse 78 bpm  respiratory rate 19/min  temperature 98.7°F  and weight 265 lbs. Cardiac evaluation reveals distant heart sounds and a systolic ejection murmur. Pulmonary examination reveals mild rales at both lower lung bases. His BMI calculations show obesity. His skin reveals slow wound healing  suggestive of poor glycemic control and reinforcing his diabetic condition.  Diagnosis  Considering his symptoms  past medical history  and family history of cardiovascular diseases  Mr. A.B. has been diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease. Diagnostic tests  including EKG and stress test  support this diagnosis.  Management  His treatment plan includes dual antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and statins following the current AHA/ACC guidelines for CAD. As Mr. A.B. also has diabetes  optimal glycemic control would be a crucial part of his management. Lifestyle modifications  including a healthy diet  exercise  and weight management  will be strongly emphasized. He will need regular check-ups to monitor his blood glucose  lipid profile  renal function  and liver enzymes due to the potential side effects of his medications.  A heart-healthy diet  exercise  smoking cessation (if applicable)  and stress management serve as the keystones of treatment. Translating these lifestyle modifications into sustainable change requires patient education and active involvement  allowing Mr. A.B. to play an active role in his health management.  Given the central role of CAD in his case  collaboration with a cardiologist for optimal CAD care management is essential. Depending on the severity of his coronary blockage  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be required.
Coronary artery disease,9,60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 62-year-old African-American man residing in Brooklyn  New York with a known diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Mr. Doe is a retired construction worker and appears moderately overweight; his measured BMI is 28  implying a classification of being overweight.   Past Medical History:   His past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which he has been on metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin respectively. He has a 30-pack year smoking history  although he quit smoking about ten years back after being diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). He admits to having consumed alcohol socially  until five years ago.  Family History:   His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 58  and his mother suffered from hypertension and diabetes; she died of stroke at 75. His older sister is alive and well at age 65  but his younger brother  aged 60  also has CAD.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Doe has been presenting with increased shortness of breath on exertion and frequent episodes of typical chest pain radiating to his left upper arm over the last three weeks  which is consistent with angina pectoris. He also reported sporadic episodes of nocturnal chest discomfort. These symptoms have escalated over the past 10 days and have started affecting his daily routine.   Examination:   Physical examination reveals him to be normotensive and his cardiovascular examination demonstrates a regular rhythm without any murmurs  rubs  or gallops. There is no clinical evidence of peripheral atheroma. His BMI  blood pressure and the typical nature of his chest pain  his COPD  and diabetes all contribute to a high pre-test probability of CAD.  This case presentation holds relevance given the disposition of coronary artery disease to be more prevalent among African-Americans  males  older age groups  and individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol. The case indicates the importance of highlighting symptoms and disease management in similar patients and understates the importance of better lifestyle modifications to impact prognosis positively.  Investigations:  His baseline investigations including complete blood count  renal function test  and liver function test were within the normal range. His latest HbA1c was 7.2%  and his fasting lipid profile showed a LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL. An echocardiogram will be scheduled to assess his left ventricular function and the severity of his CAD.  Management:  Considering the family history  presenting complaints  and past medical history; an urgent cardiovascular evaluation is scheduled. He is instructed to continue his current home medications  and nitroglycerin is prescribed to relieve his angina symptoms. He is also counseled on the importance of maintaining a balanced diet  regular exercise  adherence to medication  and avoidance of risk factors for coronary artery disease.  References:  Perk  J.

Coronary artery disease,9,61,"Case Presentation:   Patient Profile:  Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male from pro-healthcare oriented middle-class family living in a suburban community. He has been recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He is a retired mechanical engineer  married  with three adult children. He continues to consume alcohol moderately and has been a regular smoker  consuming over one pack of cigarettes per day  for 40 years.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith reports experiencing episodes of angina  typically associated with moderate to vigorous physical activity  lasting for about 10 mins. In the past six months  he has also noticed increasing breathlessness on exertion  fatigue  and occasional episodes of dizziness.  Past Medical History:  Our patient has a 10-year history of Type 2 diabetes and was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago  both being managed with medication. He has not adhered well to his diabetic medication schedule due to a lack of symptom management.   Family History:  His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his elder brother  currently 72  has been diagnosed with CAD. There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension.  Examination Findings: On physical examination  Mr. Smith weighs 215 lbs and is 5'8"""" tall  correponding to a BMI of 32.7  indicative of obesity. His blood pressure is consistently elevated with readings around 150/90 mm Hg. His fasting blood glucose levels are also elevated above the standard diabetes management range. During the cardiovascular examination  no heart murmurs or abnormal sounds are noticed.   Prognosis: Given Mr. Smith’s age  continuous smoking habit  history of hypertension  diabetes  obesity  an elevated cholesterol level  and family history of heart disease  he is at an extremely high risk for severe coronary artery disease complications. This includes myocardial infarction  heart failure  and sudden cardiac death.  Management: Given that Mr. Smith has multiple modifiable risk factors  a management plan including lifestyle changes  medication  and potential surgical interventions  such as angioplasty or bypass surgery  will be crucial. His management team would involve a cardiologist  endocrinologist  dietitian  and a physical therapist to provide a targeted approach each of his risk factors.   Please note that this is a fictional case and the patient's state of health  symptoms  test results can vary greatly depending on their individual health and lifestyle factors."
Coronary artery disease,9,62,Patient Overview: Mr. Alan Taylor  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who resides in Baltimore  Maryland  presented with chief complaints of chest pain radiating to his left arm along with episodes of breathlessness. He is a retired school teacher  a widower  living with his daughter and her family.   Medical History: Mr. Taylor is a diabetic (since the last 15 years) and hypertensive (since the last 10 years). Both conditions are relatively controlled  with occasional spikes in blood pressure readings. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia diagnosed approximately 5 years prior. The patient had a Transient Ischemic Attack 3 years ago but recovered without residua. He reports minimal physical activity and follows a rich diet.  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 64 and his elder sibling had a history of CABG procedure done at the age of 70. There is a noted familial history of type 2 diabetes on his mother's side.  Presenting Complaints: On examination  his BMI categorized him in the overweight range. He reported progressive chest pain which aggravated on physical exertion over the last two months. He has experienced increased frequency of these symptoms in the past week. The anginal pain is associated with sweating and lasts about 15 minutes. He has noted dyspnea on exertion corresponding to NYHA class II.  Diagnostic Evaluation: An ECG was suggestive of T wave inversions in the inferolateral leads. The echocardiogram showed impaired LV systolic function. Troponin I levels were elevated. He was sent for a coronary angiogram that revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery.  Mr. Taylor was referred to a Cardiologist for further intervention. Taking into account his current health status  multiple co-morbidities (diabetes  hypertension)  family history  and the severity of the occlusion  it was decided to stabilize him medically and plan for a percutaneous coronary intervention.  Discussion: The patient's risk factors include advanced age  hypertension  a history of diabetes  family history of premature heart disease  sedentary lifestyle  overweight status  and hyperlipidemia. Mr. Taylor's case is indicative of a large swath of CAD patients in the US as demographic trends highlight the prevalence of the disease in males  individuals older than 65  and those with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes  which are significant risk factors for CAD.   From a treatment perspective  it's crucial to manage Mr. Taylor's modifiable risk factors which include hyperlipidemia  diabetes  hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle. The patient will benefit from regular exercise  diet modification  and strict control of diabetes and hypertension. He is also a candidate for statin therapy and antiplatelet therapy.   With appropriate intervention and lifestyle changes  we can aim to prevent disease progression  control symptoms  reduce the frequency of angina  and improve his quality of life. His family plays a significant role in his transition towards a healthier lifestyle. Close follow-up visits will be necessary for monitoring overall health and medication adjustments.

He is married and has three adult children. He is an ex-smoker who quit 5 years ago after smoking 1 pack per day for 40 years. He is moderate in alcohol consumption  preferring beer. He does minimal physical exercise and his BMI is 29  close to obesity.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Garcia presented to the emergency department complaining of recurring chest pain that radiates to his left arm and shortness of breath. He reported episodes of intense pain that generally occurred with exertion and at night. The episodes started 1 week ago and progressively worsened.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia  has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years  controlled with Metformin. A year ago  he suffered from high blood pressure  which was controlled with medication (Lisinopril). His cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been somewhat elevated in the last two years.  Family History: Both his father and maternal uncle died of heart attacks in their 50s. His mother is a diabetic and has hypertension. His older sister is also a diabetic. There is no known family history of respiratory diseases or malignancies.  Examination and Diagnostic Testing: Physical exam revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg  heart rate of 85 bpm  and normal body temperature. His EKG showed ST segment depression indicating myocardial ischemia. Chest X-ray ruled out pneumonia. His blood tests showed elevated troponin levels  high LDL cholesterol  and high blood glucose levels. The angiogram revealed a significant narrowing in one of the branches of the left coronary artery  supporting the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.  Management Plan: Mr. Garcia was admitted to the Cardiology Department for further management. His initial treatment included aspirin  a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  and a Statin (Atorvastatin) for lipid management. He will also continue with Lisinopril and Metformin. A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is recommended due to the severity of the obstruction. He will also be referred to a dietitian for dietary management and a physical therapist for physical rehabilitation post-CABG.   Discussion: This case is a classic presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD)  common among elderly males with risk factors like long-term smoking  hypertension  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  diabetes  and a family history of CAD. As per demographic representation in the literature  CAD is highly prevalent amongst Hispanic populations  resulting from primarily lifestyle and genetic factors.
Coronary artery disease,9,66,Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Doe. He is retired from work since five years and lives with his wife  in a suburban region of New York.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Doe has recently been diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He presented with severe bouts of chest pain  particularly during physical exertion  shortness of breath  dizziness  and fatigue.  Past Medical History: Upon review of Mr. Doe’s medical history  it is noted that he has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has been dealing with hypertension for 30 years and was diagnosed with diabetes 15 years ago. Both these conditions have been managed with medications. Additionally  Mr. Doe is a recovering alcoholic  abstinent for 10 years  and a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history.  Family History: Mr. Doe's family history reveals that his father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother died from complications of diabetes at 66. His older sister has been managing her hypertension for the past 20 years while his younger brother was diagnosed with CAD at age 58.   Physical Examination and Lab tests: Upon physical examination  Mr. Doe was noted to have a BMI of 30  indicating obesity. His blood pressure readings were on the higher side  140/90mmHg  suggesting uncontrolled hypertension.   Lab tests revealed fasting blood sugar slightly above normal indicative of uncontrolled diabetes  and elevated levels of LDL cholesterol.  Diagnosis: Based on the above information  Mr. Doe is diagnosed with CAD. His significant risk factors include age  male gender  family history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  obesity  and smoking history.   Treatment Plan: The treatment plan for Mr. Doe includes control of hypertension and diabetes through medication and lifestyle changes  strict glycemic control  and cholesterol-lowering medications to manage elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Encourage smoking cessation and suggest participation in a structured cardiac rehabilitation program. Considering Mr. Doe's age  comorbidities  family history  and severity of CAD  a discussion about potential revascularization procedures such as Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) could be initiated.   Prognosis: Prognosis largely depends on Mr. Doe's adherence to his medication and his commitment to lifestyle modifications. If managed properly  his CAD can be controlled  reducing risks for heart attack and stroke.   Follow up: Mr. Doe will have a follow-up appointment in one month  but he should contact the clinic sooner if his symptoms worsen. Regular follow-ups will be necessary every three months thereafter.     This case is only a fictitious representation to guide in preparing a presentation on CAD showing the possibility of such patient scenarios. For treating real patients  personal medical history  individual symptoms  and latest research and guidelines should be considered.
Coronary artery disease,9,67,Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  named Robert  currently residing in Los Angeles  California. Robert is a retired factory worker and has been a lifetime smoker with a pack of cigarettes per day for 45 years. Apart from smoking  Robert has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for over a decade and had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus five years ago but has been negligible about managing it. He also has a high cholesterol level and a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32kg/m2  indicating clinical obesity. He is not engaged in regular physical activity and has a poor diet primarily of red meat  fatty and processed foods  and saturated fats.  Family History: There is a significant family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Both Robert's parents succumbed to heart disease before the age of 70. His elder brother had a myocardial infarction in his late fifties.  Presenting Condition: Robert presented to the Emergency Department complaining of chest discomfort and shortness of breath after doing his usual household chores. The pain was described as crushing and radiating to his left arm and jaw. These signs and symptoms are classic of angina pectoris; however  ECG findings and elevated cardiac enzymes confirmed the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).  Treatment History and Current Plan: Previous interventions had included the prescription of antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications  alongside recommendations for lifestyle modifications. However  adherence to these interventions was poor  and medical follow-ups were irregular. The current treatment plan after the myocardial infarction includes coronary angiography followed by a possible angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)  depending on the findings. Robert is also being started on aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins  in addition to the ongoing treatment for his co-morbidities.  This case emphasizes the importance of managing modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease  like hypertension  smoking  diabetes  and sedentary lifestyle  which were all prevalent in this patient. Moreover  the patient's family history of CAD cannot be modified but should have warranted more aggressive risk factor management. His late presentation to the hospital exemplifies the barriers many patients experience  including lack of adherence to medication and follow-ups  and downplaying symptoms  which delays treatment and worsens prognosis.
Coronary artery disease,9,68,Patient Profile: Patient X is a 60-year-old African-American male who was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He has a history of long-term smoking and obesity  contributing factors to his diagnosis. He was born and has spent his entire life in Chicago  Illinois and is retired from a career in construction.  Medical History: Patient X has a medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes  with inconsistent control over his blood glucose levels. He had a minor stroke five years ago  but has since recovered with mild residual deficits. The patient occasionally drinks alcohol and has a 30-pack-year history of smoking.  Family History: His father died from a heart attack at the age of 65  and his mother passed away due to stroke at the age of 70. Two of his elder brothers have already been diagnosed with CAD. There is a clear presence of cardiovascular diseases in his family history which increases his risk.  Presenting Complaint: Patient X presented with complaints of recurrent  central chest pain radiating to his left arm. The chest pain often occurs during exertion and get relieved by rest  consistent with symptoms of angina pectoris.  Diagnosis: After a thorough examination and an ECG test  the cardiologist diagnosed him with coronary artery disease. Invasive coronary angiography revealed a 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery consistent with his CAD diagnosis.  Treatment: Upon diagnosis  he was immediately started on aspirin  beta-blockers  and statin therapy. Lifestyle modification advice was offered  including smoking cessation  weight reduction  a low-sodium diet  and a moderate exercise plan considering his diabetes and hypertension. The patient was also referred to cardiac rehabilitation.  Discussion: Patient X falls into the category of patients with a higher risk of developing CAD due to his demographic  lifestyle choices  and family history. African-American men are at increased risk for CAD  and the combination of smoking  hypertension  obesity  poor diet  and a sedentary lifestyle can significantly exacerbate this risk. His strong family history of cardiovascular diseases further increases his risk.  Respecting his cultural and lifestyle needs while developing an effective treatment plan is crucial. In this case  the management plan focuses on medication  lifestyle modification  and regular monitoring of his condition.  At this point  the patient's active participation and willingness to change his lifestyle are critical. Continuous monitoring and the potential need for revascularization if symptoms continue or exacerbate should be communicated to the patient and his caregiver.
Coronary artery disease,9,69,Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Smith presented chest discomfort during physical efforts  which relieved at rest  assumed symptoms of angina pectoris. The episodes have increased in frequency over the past week.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus in his mid-40s  he has been maintaining his blood sugar levels close to normal with metformin but has occasional abnormalities during his yearly check-ups. He also suffers from hypertension  which he keeps under control through medication (hydrochlorothiazide). He underwent an appendectomy at age 20 and has no known allergies to medications. He had been a smoker for 40 years  averaging a pack a week  but quit five years ago. He consumes moderate alcohol.  Family History:  His father passed away at 75 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother at 70 due to stroke. One of his two older brothers had a coronary artery bypass graft in his early 70s; the other brother has no known heart diseases. None of his three children has shown symptoms of cardiovascular disorders at their current ages (28-35).  Lifestyle:  Mr. Smith is a retired civil engineer. He does minimal exercise  lives a moderately sedentary lifestyle  and has a BMI of 30 indicating obesity. His diet is high in saturated fats and low in fiber.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  his pulse was 80 beats per minute  blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg. Lab results showed blood glucose of 160 mg/dl  slightly elevated LDL cholesterol  and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. ECG revealed abnormalities indicative of inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle.  Diagnosis:  Following further investigations like stress testing and coronary angiography  Mr Smith was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Plan:  The diagnosis called for immediate lifestyle and diet modifications. Mr Smith was recommended to increase physical activity  reduce saturated fat  and increase ingestion of fruits and vegetables. This was coupled with medication for lowering cholesterol levels (atorvastatin)  controlling blood pressure (continued use of hydrochlorothiazide)  and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin). Regular follow-ups to assess his condition and adjustment of treatment plan will be required.  Prognosis:  With lifestyle modification and correct medication  prognosis can be positive. However  adherence to the prescribed plan will be crucial considering his age and the severity of CAD.  This case emphasizes the significant impact of modifiable risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and poor diet in the development and progression of CAD in a patient with a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. It is crucial to manage these risk factors through proper therapy and lifestyle improvements.

His heart rhythm is regular  but with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg. Blood test results indicate elevated LDL cholesterol levels and slightly reduced HDL cholesterol levels. An electrocardiogram during an episode of chest pain reveals ST segment elevation. A subsequent angiogram demonstrated significant left anterior descending coronary artery disease.   Based on these findings  Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD).   Management & Prognostication: Initial approach included addressing his risk factors - recommending weight loss  healthier eating  regular exercise  and continued smoking cessation. His blood pressure and cholesterol levels are to be effectively treated with the necessary medications  which should include an ACE inhibitor for his high blood pressure  a statin for high cholesterol  and an anti-clotting drug. As his coronary artery disease is severe  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is also considered and discussed with him and his family.  Education Note: Patient is educated about the importance of following lifestyle modifications and regular medication. He is also informed about certain warning signs related to the heart and when to seek emergency care.  Follow-up: Regular follow-ups every 3 months are scheduled to monitor his symptoms  vital signs  weight  and lipid profile  for medication adjustments if needed  and to ensure adherence to lifestyle changes and medication regimen.

He has struggled with obesity (BMI-30) for most of his adult life with modest success at weight loss through dieting and exercise. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes four years ago  currently treated with Metformin. He quit smoking a decade ago; he was a pack-a-day smoker from the age of 18 to 53. Recently  he reported to his primary care provider experiencing episodes of intermittent chest pain over the past two months  which prompted further cardiac diagnostics.  Family History:  Mr. Doe's father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and his mother has type 2 diabetes. His older brother had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at 65 and is currently alive and well.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Doe came to the emergency room after experiencing severe chest pain while he was doing yard work and felt lightheaded. His chest pain was relieved with rest and nitroglycerin. There's no radiation of the pain and he denies any associated nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  Physical Examination:  On admission  Mr. Doe was alert and oriented. His blood pressure was 150/90  heart rate was 80 bpm and regular  respirations were 16 per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Lungs were clear to auscultation  heart sounds were regular without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. No lower extremity edema was appreciated.  Investigations:  His EKG showed signs of past inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and blood tests revealed elevated troponin levels  a marker for damage to the heart. Upon referral to a cardiologist  he underwent an angiogram which showed a 70% blockage in his right coronary artery  confirming the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Management:  Mr. Doe is scheduled for a percutaneous coronary intervention and then is advised for cardiac rehabilitation. He will continue his antihypertensive medication  with an added prescription for a statin to manage cholesterol and a low dose aspirin for its anti-platelet effect. He is recommended to follow the Mediterranean diet to help manage his weight and encouraged to make lifestyle changes including limiting alcohol and increasing physical activities.  Education:  Consistent patient education concerning his disease process  medication regimen  and proper nutrition is ongoing. He has been provided with resources to help manage stress as excessively high-stressed individuals often have poorly controlled hypertension and cholesterol.  No genetic testing was performed on Mr. Doe  as according to American Heart Association guidelines  it is not usually necessary in cases of late-onset CAD with traditional risk factors like diabetes  obesity  and family history. However  his immediate family (children) may want to consider genetic testing for early-onset coronary disease based on the paternal side family history.
Coronary artery disease,9,72,Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe  a 62-year-old African American Male  currently residing in Chicago  Illinois  presented with chest pain radiating to the left arm.  Past medical history:  He is known to have a high blood pressure of 15 years duration (currently managed with medication)  type II Diabetes Mellitus for eight years  and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago. Prior admission for similar complaints was once  about a year ago  where no definite diagnosis was made. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking  though he quit 5 years ago  and an occasional alcohol drinker.  Family history: His father passed away at the age of 68 due to myocardial infarction. John's younger brother  Mike  underwent angioplasty at the age of 55.   Physical Examination:  On arrival  he seemed to be in pain  pallor noted  with a respiratory rate of 22/minute  pulse 84/minute  BP 150/100 mm hg.  pulse oximetry 96% at room air. On cardiac examination  there were no murmurs or gallops. There were no pertinent findings on rest of the physical examination.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  Taking note of his prolonged history of uncontrolled hypertension  significant lipid disorder  positive family history  and current symptoms  John was suspected for acute coronary syndrome. An EKG showed ST-depressions in leads II  III  and aVF. Troponin levels were also elevated. A coronary angiogram was performed  which demonstrated significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. Given these findings  John was diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Management: John was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel)  high-dose statin  beta-blockers  and nitroglycerin for immediate relief of chest pain. He was subsequently taken to the cath lab for coronary angioplasty and stenting of the involved segments. Post-procedure  the patient reported significant improvement of his chest pain.   This case emphasizes the importance of risk stratification and early intervention in patients presenting with chest pain and with a notable history of atherosclerotic risk factors. It confirms the prominent role that hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and family history play in the development of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,9,73,Patient Information:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who lives a sedentary lifestyle and employed as a businessman. He is a nonsmoker and a social drinker. He lives with his wife in California and neither of them have children.   Chief Complaint:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  Present Illness:  Mr. Smith has been facing intermittent episodes of chest pain  particularly angina  for the past few months. The pain often intensifies upon physical exertion and lessens during rest. Recently  he also experienced shortness of breath after a small bout of exercise.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history includes being diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes. He has been fairly consistent with his therapeutic regimen  which includes insulin and lipid-lowering medications. He has no history of surgeries.  Family History:  His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 57 and passed away due to congestive heart failure. His mother is 80 years old and has hypertension. Coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be a hereditary factor in this scenario.  Social History: Mr. Smith has a stable marriage and a supportive network of friends. However  his work involves high levels of stress. He has a sedentary lifestyle with little exercise and occasionally indulges in high-fat  high-sodium foods.  Examination: Physical examination revealed Mr. Smith to be obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2. He has a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. Auscultation indicated normal heart and lung sounds.   Investigations:  Given the history and presenting symptoms  he underwent an ECG and stress test  both of which hinted at ischemic changes. The coronary angiogram revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery.   Diagnosis: Based on his symptoms  family history  lifestyle  results from the ECG  stress test  and angiogram  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Management Plan: The initial management plan includes lifestyle modifications - regular exercise  a balanced diet  weight reduction  and stress management. Medications such as antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin)  statins  and beta-blockers would be included in the treatment plan. Depending upon his response to medication and lifestyle changes  further intervention like coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) might be warranted.  This is a typical case of coronary artery disease with a fairly common symptomology and risk factors  including age  gender  hereditary  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  obesity  and work stress. Mr. Smith's case emphasizes the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors to prevent the progression of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,9,74,Patient Presentation:  Mr. A is a 68-year-old African American male diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He presented to the clinic complaining of chronic chest pains that intensify when he engages in physical activities.  Demographic Factors:  Mr. A resides in a suburban area of Pennsylvania. He is a retired mechanical engineer  widowed with three adult children. Statistically  the incidence of CAD is higher among African American males  and the age of onset is typically in the sixth or seventh decade of life.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A is a former smoker  having quit at the age of 48  and a light social drinker. He was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol 8 years ago. His body mass index (BMI) is 30  which places him in the obese category. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago. These are all considered significant risk factors for CAD.  Family History:  Mr. A's family medical history is significant with heart-related problems. His father passed away at the age of 75 from a heart attack  while his mother died at 80 from stroke complications. Two of his three siblings have hypertension and his younger brother was recently diagnosed with CAD.  Coronary Artery Disease:  CAD  also known as ischemic heart disease  occurs when cholesterol plaque builds up in the coronary arteries leading to atherosclerosis. This narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to the heart  causing angina or more seriously a heart attack or stroke. Mr. A's chest pain (angina) is classic symptom of CAD and happens when the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen.  Clinic Visit:  During his consultation  Mr. A reported chronic chest discomfort which he refers to as a heaviness in the chest area. This feeling exacerbates whenever he attempts any physical activities like climbing stairs or walking uphill. Additionally  he also reported recent instances of feeling faint and episodes of irregular heartbeat.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Primary findings included raised blood pressure (156/94 mmHg) and borderline high total cholesterol (200 mg/dL). An Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment depression indicating possible insufficient blood flow to the heart. These findings  combined with his symptoms  led to the diagnosis of CAD.   Management Plan:  Mr. A was advised of the immediate need for lifestyle modifications including adopting a diet low in cholesterol and sodium  exercise  and a smoking cessation program. Medications prescribed included a daily aspirin  a beta-blocker for controlling blood pressure  a statin to lower cholesterol levels  and nitroglycerin to control chest pains as needed. Cardiac rehab was also suggested to improve his cardiovascular health further and lower the risk of future heart problems.    The patient was also educated regarding the disease  lifestyle modification  medication compliance  and adverse effects. Arrangements were also made for a follow-up appointment in 3 months for effectiveness of treatment evaluation. Since CAD has a genetic predisposition  his children were also encouraged to get screened. 
Coronary artery disease,9,75,Case Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Perez is a 65-year-old Hispanic male residing in Miami  Florida. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. Mr. Perez is a non-smoker but acknowledges borderline alcohol consumption. He is moderately obese (BMI=30.5) and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Perez presented to the emergency room with symptoms of intermittent chest pain radiating to his left arm. The pain has been increasing over the last two weeks  especially during exertion.  Past Medical History: He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia for 10 years. His medication includes Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. Mr. Perez admits occasional non-compliance with his medication due to forgetfulness.  Family History: Both his father and eldest brother had heart attacks in their mid-60s and his mother has hypertension.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Perez's blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  and heart rate 85 bpm. Upon auscultation  a soft systolic murmur was detected.   Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed evidence of anterior wall ischemia. Subsequent cardiac catheterization confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD) with a 70% blockage of the left anterior descending artery.  Plan: Mr. Perez was advised to stay in the hospital for further observation. Medical management included adjusting his antihypertensive regimen to better control his blood pressure  adding low-dose aspirin and a beta-blocker to his daily medications. Lifestyle modifications were discussed  including a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  strict medication compliance  moderation of alcohol consumption  and attending cardiac rehabilitation. The patient was presented with potential interventions like angioplasty or bypass surgery. However  the decision was postponed considering his present symptoms and coronary anatomy.  Health literacy was a concern due to Mr. Perez's limited understanding of his condition and medication regimen. Patient education was initiated in Spanish for better understanding  involving his wife in the discussion to provide support at home.  Conclusion: In this case  the patient's ethnic background  age  and multiple risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and family history point towards CAD's demographic trends. Management should focus not only on aggressive medical therapy but also on lifestyle modifications and patient education.
Coronary artery disease,9,76,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He is a retired school principal and lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife. He occasionally goes for short walks to stay active and maintains an omnivorous diet.   Past Medical History:  Prior to the recent diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD)  Mr. Smith has had a history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diabetic condition was diagnosed ten years ago and has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. His blood pressure was found to be elevated five years ago at a routine check-up. This condition has since been controlled with daily medication  i.e.  ACE inhibitors.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's father passed away at 60 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother died at 75  suffering from diabetes and hypertension. He has two brothers  one of whom is suffering from hypertension  while the other has no significant health issues.   Presenting Problem:  Mr. Smith visited the clinic complaining of intermittent chest pain  especially on exertion  over the past month. The pain often radiates to his left arm and is relieved by rest. He denied having any symptoms of dizziness  shortness of breath  diaphoresis  or nausea/vomiting.  Investigations:  Following ECG and cardiac enzyme tests  the patient was diagnosed with CAD. Further assessment through angiography showed significant blockage in two of his coronary arteries.   Treatment Plan:  Considering Mr. Smith's family history  lifestyle  and existing comorbidities  the treatment plan includes lifestyle modification (diet change  increased exercise  stress management  and smoking cessation if relevant)  medical treatment (statins  antiplatelet drugs  beta-blockers)  and in severe cases  intervention such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).  Discussion: In the U.S.  CAD is more prevalent among Caucasian individuals over 65  and Mr. Smith's case fits this demographic trend. Moreover  his conditions of diabetes and hypertension are known risk factors for CAD. The strong family history of cardiovascular diseases further increased his risk for developing CAD. Primary prevention strategies  such as lifestyle modification and control of diabetes and hypertension  can be beneficial in reducing the progression of the disease.  In conclusion  this case of Mr. Smith highlights the importance of regular screening for CAD in high-risk individuals. Early treatment of underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  along with lifestyle modifications  can significantly alleviate the progression of CAD. 
Coronary artery disease,9,77,"Patient Demographics and History  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  married  and a former smoker who quit about 15 years ago. He lives in a suburban area of Alabama with his wife. Socioeconomic status is middle-class. He is mildly overweight with a BMI of 27 and does not engage in regular physical activity. He has a history of poorly managed hypertension for about 15 years and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  for which he intermittently takes prescribed medication. He has a prior history of a myocardial infarction about 5 years ago. His father had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and died from a heart attack at the age of 65; his mother had hypertension and lived till age 85.  Recent Development  The patient presented to the clinic complaining of episodes of chest pain that were relieved by rest. The pain was described as a ‘crushing’ feeling in the center of his chest. He also reported experiencing mild shortness of breath on exertion and occasional bouts of dizziness. The patient admitted that he has not adhered to dietary advice given after his myocardial infarction and has been consuming high cholesterol and salt-rich foods. He has been resistant to instituting lifestyle changes  stating that he is """"too set in his ways"""" to change.  Clinical Findings  Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 170/95 mm Hg. Heart rate was regular at 75 beats per minute. Pulses were palpable  and no signs of congestive heart failure were observed. The patient's fasting blood glucose was found to be elevated (190 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.5%) showed poorly controlled diabetes. Lipid profile showed significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels (150 mg/dL) and reduced HDL cholesterol levels (35 mg/dL).  On performing an electrocardiogram (ECG)  T-wave inversions were observed in leads II  III  and aVF  suggesting ischemia. The patient was sent to perform an exercise stress test  where he developed chest pain and ST depression on the ECG suggestive of exertional angina.  Diagnosis and Treatment   Based on the above findings  the patient was diagnosed with stable angina resulting from coronary artery disease. Treatment includes advising the patient to take appropriate measures to control his blood sugar and blood pressure. The patient was advised to adopt a healthier diet with low cholesterol and salt  along with moderate physical activities such as walking. Medication regimen was adjusted  including statins for lipid control  beta-blockers for heart rate control  ACE inhibitors for blood pressure  nitrates for angina relief and aspirin for its antiplatelet effect. The importance of medication adherence was emphasized.  Referral was made for coronary angiography to assess the extent and severity of the coronary blockage. The possibility of revascularization procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)  if found significant blockage  was discussed with the patient and his family. Regular outpatient follow-up for monitoring and lifestyle interventions was scheduled."
Coronary artery disease,9,78,Patient Case Presentation: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  hailing from a suburban locality in Chicago  Illinois  was referred to our cardiology department for evaluation. He has recently been diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Mr. Doe is a retiree who formerly worked in a high-stress corporate environment for more than 30 years.   Medical History:  Upon inquiring about past medical history  we found that he has been managing persistent hypertension for the past 15 years  which had been generally well-controlled using ACE inhibitors. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago and is on statin therapy. He was a chronic smoker (1 pack/day) for 40 years but has stopped 2 years back. He also acknowledges periodic episodes of chest pain over the past 6 months.  Family History:  Mr. Doe has a family history of CAD  with his father experiencing a fatal heart attack at the age of 68. His mother died from a stroke at 72. His elder brother underwent a stent placement procedure for his coronary arteries at the age of 63.  Social History:  Mr. Doe is a widower living with his son's family. He denies alcohol use. His diet was reportedly high in trans fats and carbohydrates with minimal physical activity  due to his sedentary lifestyle during his working years. However  he has made dietary changes since his hyperlipidemia diagnosis.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  he presented with a BMI of 30 suggesting obesity. His blood pressure was elevated  with readings of typically around 150/90 mmHg. Cardiac examination demonstrated no murmurs or extra heart sounds.  Diagnostic Findings:  His lipid profile showed elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels at 160 mg/dL and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels at 35mg/dL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of past myocardial infarctions and a stress test confirmed decreased blood flow to the heart muscle.   In conclusion  this case demonstrates a clear connection between CAD and several risk factors such as age  male gender  family history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and an unhealthy diet. These factors have been extensively documented in numerous studies concerning CAD. Getting these under control should be a priority in managing Mr. Doe's treatment plan. Interventional cardiology consultation and potential angioplasty or stent placement might be considered based on his degree of stenosis. Primary care will continue to manage his hypertension  hyperlipidemia and lifestyle modification.
Coronary artery disease,9,79,Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old African American male residing in an urban neighborhood of Los Angeles  California. He is recently retired from a long career as a bus driver with irregular and lengthy hours. He is married and has two adult children  both of whom live out of state.  Past medical history:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension for which he was prescribed medication a couple of years ago. However  he is not compliant with his medication due to issues with access to healthcare and chronic stressors related to socioeconomic and environmental factors. He also has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes and was recently diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.   Family history:  There is a strong family history of heart disease  with his father passing away from a heart attack at the age of 70 and his mother passing away from stroke-related complications at 72. Mr. Smith's elder brother  68 years of age  was also diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) a few years back.  Presenting Complaint:  He presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of squeezing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and shortness of breath that started while he was walking up a flight of stairs at home. He also reports episodes of dizziness  palpitations  and nausea over the last week.   Diagnosis:  After thorough examination including an electrocardiogram  echocardiogram  stress test  and coronary angiography  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. His laboratory investigations showed elevated fasting blood sugar levels and elevated blood cholesterol  indicating poor control of his diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  Conclusion:  Given the presenting symptoms  coupled with his significant risk factors which include his family history  non-compliance with medication for his existing comorbidities  his diabetes  hypertensive history  and racial group (as CAD has been seen to be prevalent in African Americans compared to their Caucasian counterparts)  the diagnosis of CAD was made.   Future considerations involve getting Mr. Smith's existing conditions under control in order to manage his CAD. This would involve a close collaboration with a cardiologist  endocrinologist  and dietitian. Mr. Smith will also need close follow-ups to monitor his compliance with medication and progress. Lifestyle modifications such as a heart-healthy diet  physical activity  smoking cessation if applicable  and stress management would be critical aspects of his treatment plan.
Coronary artery disease,9,80,Title: A Case Study on Coronary Artery Disease  I. Patient Information The subject of this case presentation is a non-Hispanic white male  Mr. A  who is 70 years old. Literature suggests that men in this age group  particularly those between 65 and 75 years  are more prone to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Non-Hispanic whites have reportedly the highest prevalence rate of CAD among the different ethnic groups in the US.  II. Demographic Information Mr. A resides in Wisconsin  a state in the Midwest known for cheese. He is in his third year of retirement after a long career as a construction worker. He lives with his wife  and they have two adult children living in different states. He smoke tobacco moderately  drinks alcohol occasionally  and is overweight.  III. Past Medical History Mr. A has a several-year history of hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus  both of which he has managed with regular medication: calcium channel blockers for hypertension  and oral hypoglycemic agents for diabetes. These conditions are well-documented risk factors for CAD. He also suffers from moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  likely due to his smoking habit.  IV. Family History His father died from a heart attack at the age of 58  and his mother  now deceased  was diabetic. His older sister underwent angioplasty at the age of 60. This family history indicates a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes  another significant risk factor for CAD.  V. Current Complaint & Clinical Findings Mr. A has lately experienced occasional episodes of chest pain  especially after exertion. He has taken on a habit to rest or stop doing activities when chest pain comes. Upon further examination  an electrocardiogram showed ST segment depression indicative of possible myocardial ischemia. His lipid profile revealed elevated LDL cholesterol levels and reduced HDL cholesterol levels  which is concerning  given his predisposition to atherosclerosis and CAD.  VI. Diagnosis and Therapeutic Options Combining his symptoms  risk factor profile  and clinical findings  it is highly likely that Mr. A has Coronary Artery Disease. Management should be multimodal  including lifestyle modifications  medical therapies  and potentially revascularization. Urging him to quit smoking  improve diet  and increase physical activity would be beneficial in reducing his risk factors. Medical therapies may include aspirin  beta-blockers  statins  and ACE inhibitors. If symptoms persist  revascularization procedures like angioplasty/stenting  or coronary artery bypass grafting could be considered.   With appropriate intervention and lifestyle changes  we may positively impact Mr. A’s health and prevent further cardiac events. 
Coronary artery disease,9,81,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He lives in Baltimore  Maryland and works as a high school principal. He is married for 41 years and has 3 children. He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Johnson presented at his regular check-up with complaints of fatigue  shortness of breath  impaired ability to exercise  and occasional chest discomfort.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension controlled with medication for the past ten years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past five years. Mr. Johnson had undergone a treatment regimen for prostate cancer two years ago and is currently in remission. He is also overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30. However  he does not have any known allergies or history of surgeries.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson's paternal grandfather died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. His father has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and his mother has hypertension. His eldest sibling  a brother  also suffers from CAD.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  heart rate regular at 85 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation showed no murmurs or extra sounds.  Investigations:  Results from the blood work revealed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (160 mg/dL)  as well as elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (7.5%)  indicating poor diabetes control. His Troponin levels were normal.  Electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in the inferolateral leads and an echocardiogram showed impaired left ventricular function with regional wall motion abnormalities.  Diagnosis:  Given Mr. Johnson’s clinical manifestation  family medical history and laboratory findings  a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) was made.  Treatment Plan:  His treatment plan includes medical therapy with aspirin  a statin  an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and a β-blocker. Also  a plan for optimizing glycemic control and lifestyle modification  including diet control for weight reduction and cessation of alcohol  was discussed.  Overall  Mr. Johnson's case is representative of common demographic traits associated with CAD  including hypertension  diabetes  increasing age  male gender  and African American race. His lifestyle  family history  and clinical findings require a comprehensive treatment approach to prevent further worsening of his CAD.   (Note: This case presentation is fictional and for instructional purposes only. Real patient care requires a thorough history  examination  and evaluation by a trained healthcare professional.)
Coronary artery disease,9,82,Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. John Smith - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired mechanic - Race: Caucasian - Lifestyle: Sedentary with poor diet - Smoking: 30 years  currently quitting - Alcohol: Occasional social drinker  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago. He has been on Metformin for diabetes and Losartan for hypertension. He has been inconsistent in taking his medications and maintaining a healthy diet. He has also been struggling to quit smoking.   He presented to the clinic with complaints of chest pain over the past week. The pain was described as heavy pressure in the center of his chest  primarily during physical exertion and it was typically relieved by rest. There was no referred pain to his arms or jaw but he mentioned feeling sweaty and short of breath during these episodes. His blood pressure during the visit was elevated to 150/95 mmHg.  Family History: Mr. Smith’s father died of a myocardial infarction at age 65 and his mother has hypertension. He has two siblings  one of whom has been diagnosed with dyslipidemia and the other with diabetes.  Diagnostic Evaluation: The patient was sent for an EKG which showed T wave inversions in the anterior leads  suggestive of possible myocardial ischemia. Subsequently  a treadmill stress test was positive for inducible ischemia and he was referred for a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization identified significant (>70%) blockages in two of his coronary arteries - the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA).  Case Summary:  This is a case of a 65-year-old retired mechanic  Mr. John Smith. He has risk factors including a sedentary lifestyle  poor diet  and smoking along with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He presented with chest pain  shortness of breath  and sweating during physical exertion. Tests revealed blockages in his major coronary arteries and he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. His disease may have been influenced by his genetic predisposition (family history of heart disease)  lifestyle and poorly controlled comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.
Coronary artery disease,9,83,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony Rogers is a 65-year-old male African American  who was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He is a resident of Houston  Texas  and works as an accountant.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Rogers has been hypertensive for the last 15 years controlled with lisinopril. He is also a type 2 diabetic  managed with metformin for the past 10 years  with reasonable glycemic control. His body mass index (BMI) is 29  which places him in the overweight category. Mr. Rogers has experienced no prior hospitalizations  except for a cholecystectomy 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaint and History of Presenting Complaint:  His recent presentation to the cardiology clinic was due to escalating episodes of exertional chest pain for the last 3 months. The pain is described as “pressure-like”  located in the center of the chest and radiates to his left arm  usually lasting 10-15 minutes  initiated by walking moderate distances. He denies any other associated symptoms like shortness of breath  sweating  or fainting. No similar previous episodes were reported.  Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at 68  and his mother suffers from hypertension. His older brother  67  was also diagnosed with CAD a year ago. No familial history of diabetes was reported.  Examination:  Upon examination  Mr. Rogers is slightly dyspneic  with a slightly elevated blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg. No abnormal heart or lung sounds were noticed. Lower limb edema was absent.  Investigations:  ECG showed signs of previous silent myocardial ischemia. His blood test reported elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels but other measures were within the normal range  including his HbA1C  indicating good glycemic control.  Management:  Along with continuation of lisinopril and metformin  Mr. Rogers was started on a regimen of aspirin  beta-blockers  and statins. He was also recommended to lose weight and maintain a regular exercise schedule. A referral was made for angiography to rule out significant coronary artery stenosis.   Considering his risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  family history  overweight status  and elevated cholesterol levels  it can be inferred that Mr. Rogers CAD has a multifactorial etiology. The team will closely monitor his response to the treatment plan and make adjustments accordingly.  Note: The demographic representation utilizes research data  which shows African Americans have a high risk of developing CAD due to a higher prevalence of risk factors (hypertension  diabetes  and obesity). Also  CAD tends to appear earlier among African Americans compared to Caucasian counterparts.
Coronary artery disease,9,84,Patient Presentation  Patient Profile:  The patient  Mr. Thomas  is a 72-year-old African American male who lives in rural Georgia. He is retired now  having spent most of his life working in the construction business. He has been married for 50 years and has four adult children. His socioeconomic status would be categorized as lower-middle-class.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thomas has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes. His hypertension was diagnosed 15 years ago  and he has been on antihypertensive medication since then. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years ago  and he takes metformin. Despite his chronic conditions  his disease management has been inconsistent due to financial constraints caused by his fixed income in retirement.  Family History: Mr. Thomas' father passed away at the age of 60 from a heart attack  and his older brother  who is 75  recently had a minor stroke. His mother passed away from complications related to diabetes when she was 68. He also has a family history of high cholesterol.  Present Complaint: Recently  Mr. Thomas has been experiencing shortness of breath when walking up hills or stairs  which he has never had trouble with before. He also reports that he has been experiencing chest pains during these episodes. He reckons these started about three weeks ago and the severity has been progressively increasing.   Physical Examination and Diagnosis: On examination  Mr. Thomas' blood pressure was elevated and his chest appeared clear. An EKG showed abnormal Q-waves and ST-segment elevation  suggestive of a previous myocardial infarction. His blood lipid profile showed an increase in total cholesterol levels with a significant increase in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and a reduction HDL cholesterol. Echo-cardiogram confirms a narrowed coronary artery.  Diagnosis: Mr. Thomas was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  which was probably precipitated by his history of hypertension  Diabetes and family history  combined with his increasing age and race.   Plan: Mr. Thomas’ comprehensive care plan includes a combination of medical therapy  lifestyle modification  psychosocial support  patient and caregiver education  disease monitoring  and coordination of care among providers and caregivers. Mr. Thomas will be prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications  aspirin and potentially beta-blockers to help manage his CAD. He will be advised to limit his intake of fatty foods and sugar  and to introduce a regular exercise regimen. He has been referred to a social worker to assist with accessing local resources to help manage his conditions  given his socioeconomic status. His children are encouraged to be involved in his care and the decision-making process for better support.    Mr. Thomas' case is representative of many elderly African American men living in rural areas who are dealing with chronic conditions and caring for those who are economically disadvantaged. These patients frequently forego treatment due to the cost  leading to increased mortality and higher rates of complications.

Coronary artery disease,9,96,Patient Profile: The patient is a male  Mr. John Connecticut  aged 64 years old of African-American racial background. He is a resident of New York City.  Family and Social History: Mr. Connecticut's father died at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction and his mother died at the age of 85 due to natural causes. He has one sibling  a sister  who is 62 and has been diagnosed with diabetes. The patient is a retired teacher  a widower  and currently lives alone. He has three children who live out of state. Mr. Connecticut also has a 20-year history of consuming moderate levels of alcohol and was a smoker  a pack a day for 40 years  but quit smoking ten years ago. He has been moderately active throughout his life but has shown a steady decline in physical activity over the past five years.  Medical History: Mr. Connecticut was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia ten years ago  for which he has been taking regular medication. He had an episode of chest pain two days ago which lasted for approximately 15 minutes. He didn't seek immediate medical help assuming it to be indigestion. When the chest pain recurred  he reported to the emergency department where an electrocardiogram (ECG) was conducted. He was found to have ST-elevation  and a subsequent cardiac catheterization confirmed the presence of a significant blockage in the right coronary artery  diagnosing him with coronary artery disease (CAD).  Physical Examination and Lab Data: On examination  he weighed 210 lbs with a height of 5’9’’ (BMI of 31 indicating obesity) and had a blood pressure reading of 150/90 mmHg. He had raised Total cholesterol (250 mg/dL)  LDL cholesterol (160 mg/dL)  and triglycerides levels (180 mg/dL). His fasting glucose was in the prediabetic range (110 mg/dL).  Treatment: Given his medical history and CAD diagnosis  he was started on a beta-blocker  an ACE inhibitor  and a statin. He was also suggested to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to clear the blockage in the artery.  Discussion: Considering that several risk factors for CAD are present in the patient  including age  sex  race (African American men are at a greater risk)  family history of heart disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and history of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption  it is vital to plan a management approach addressing these risk factors. His planned intervention (PCI)  in combination with medical management and lifestyle alterations  including smoking cessation  exercise  and dietary modifications  might improve his overall health status and reduce future cardiovascular risk.  The case displays the importance of taking a thorough history and maintaining a high degree of suspicion for CAD in patients with multiple risk factors  even when presenting symptoms might seem benign or misleading. Regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the patient's health status.
Coronary artery disease,9,97,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who presented with chest pain  consistent with angina pectoris. He is an ex-smoker/drinker  quit about four years ago after a long 30+ years habit. Mr. Doe is a retired electrical engineer  lives with his wife and regularly participates in community charity events.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years ago and maintains his blood pressure by taking Lisinopril (ACE inhibitors). He also has borderline high cholesterol treated with Atorvastatin. He was not diagnosed with diabetes. His BMI is 29  which indicates overweight  and he only gets light exercise - mostly walks in the neighborhood.   Family History: His mother died of acute myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his father  who is now 90 years old  has a history of stroke and Type 2 diabetes. He also has a younger brother who was diagnosed with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) in his late sixties.   Present Illness: Over the past two weeks  Mr. Doe has experienced recurrent episodes of sharp  substernal chest pain  usually after exertion or stress. The duration ranges from a few minutes to almost half an hour and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Nausea and mild lightheadedness accompany episodes. There have been no changes in his diet or medication regime.  Clinical Findings: A physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 145/90mmHg and a regular heart rate of 85 beats per minute. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (EKG) reveals ST depressions in leads II  III  aVF  V5  and V6. On stress testing  similar ST depressions are noted along with reproducing the chest pain. Lab results showed elevated total cholesterol at 230 mg/dl and LDL at 160 mg/dl. A coronary angiogram was performed that showed significant occlusive disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA).  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms and investigative findings  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease. Considering the patient’s severe blockage found with coronary angiogram  the care provider recommended a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).   Management Plan: The patient was advised lifestyle modifications  including a low cholesterol diet  aerobic exercises  and weight loss. Changes to his medication were also reflected by adding aspirin  a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  and a nitrate.  Conclusion: Mr. Doe's case is a classic presentation of CAD. His risk factors include hypertension  a history of heavy smoking  hypercholesterolemia  being overweight  a sedentary lifestyle  and significant family history - all of which contributes strongly to his diagnosis. The treatment involves a mix of lifestyle modifications  medications and CABG. He will require further interventions and strict monitoring to prevent adverse cardiac events. His family should also undergo screening for early identification and treatment of similar risk factors. 
Coronary artery disease,9,98,Patient Profile:  Mr. Scott  a 65-year-old Caucasian man  was recently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Past Medical History:  During his routine check-up  it was discovered that Mr. Scott has had a history of hypertension since his early 50s  reasonably managed through medication and lifestyle changes. Also  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago. He used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day but quit about 10 years ago. Mr. Scott has a BMI of 29  indicating he is overweight.  Family History: Mr. Scott’s father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and his mother had a stroke at 68 but survived.

Occasionally  he also experiences dyspnea (shortness of breath) and palpitations. Due to these complaints  he was advised to get an EKG and a stress test  the results of which suggested a probable diagnosis of CAD.  Laboratory Results: Mr. Scott's LDL cholesterol level was 160 mg/dL (Desirable level is less than 100mg/dL)  HDL was 40mg/dL (desirable levels usually 60mg/dL)  and Triglycerides 202 mg/dL (Desired level less than 150mg/dL). Fasting blood sugar was 172 mg/dL (the normal range is 70–99 mg/dL)  indicating his diabetes was not well-controlled.   Further Assessment: Further investigations  such as coronary angiography  are being scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent and location of the blockage.  Discussion: Mr. Scott's age  male sex  history of smoking  hypertension  and poorly managed diabetes - along with his overweight status  family history of heart disease  and lipid profile - puts him at high risk for CAD. These are in line with known risk factors associated with CAD as per literature. His presenting complaints also suggest angina pectoris  a characteristic symptom of CAD.   Plan: Upon confirmation of CAD  Mr. Scott will likely require a change in his current treatment regime that may include different medications  considerations for procedure like angioplasty or bypass surgery  and lifestyle modifications including a healthier diet  exercise  better managing his weight  diabetes  and overall keeping his cholesterol levels under better control. He will need to closely follow up with his cardiologist and primary care doctor.   This case underscores the importance of regular health check-ups  especially for those with multiple risk factors  to detect such silent but grave conditions like CAD early on. Also  integrating optimal lifestyle changes along with appropriate medical intervention could keep such conditions at bay.
Coronary artery disease,9,99,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. J.K. is a 65-year-old African American male  who has been recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently retired and prior to retirement  he worked in a high-stress corporate job for over 35 years. He is a resident of Chicago  Illinois  married for 40 years with three adult children.  Medical History: Mr. J.K. has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and obesity. He has been managing his diabetes with metformin for the last 10 years and his blood pressure has been controlled with lisinopril. His BMI is 31 kg/m2  indicating class I obesity. His weight has been steady for the past few years. He reports a history of moderate tobacco use  having smoked a pack a day from the age of 20 until he quit at age 60. He consumes alcohol socially  with an average of 2-3 drinks a week.   Presenting Complaint: The patient came to the clinic complaining of persistent discomfort in the chest  which he describes as a pressure-like sensation that occasionally radiates to his left arm. He also reports experiencing episodes of shortness of breath  particularly during physical exertion  and occasional episodes of cold sweats and fatigue.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother suffers from hypertension. His eldest brother  68  also suffers from cardiovascular disease.   Diagnosis and Treatment: Given his symptoms  past medical history  and family history  Mr. J.K was further evaluated and subsequently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. His diagnosis was confirmed with a coronary angiography  which revealed significant narrowing of arteries due to plaque buildup.  He has been prescribed a regimen including aspirin  beta-blockers  and statins. A change in lifestyle practices has also been recommended which includes a low-sodium and low-fat diet  moderate-intensity exercise  cessation of all tobacco products  and weight reduction. His condition and progress are continuously being monitored.  Discussion: This case underscores the strong link between risk factors such as age  ethnicity  high-stress occupation  diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and a family history of heart disease with the development of coronary artery disease. Given the high prevalence of CAD among African American populations  this case further sheds light on the need to address these risk factors among this demographic  with a particular emphasis on lifestyle modifications and early interventions for better prognosis.
Coronary artery disease,9,100,Patient Case Presentation - CAD  Introduction: The patient  known to us as Mr. A  is a 62-year-old African American male diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). He works as a university professor and resides in a small town in Southern New Jersey. Mr. A is married  has two adult children who live independently and is of middle socio-economic status.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which he has been managing for approximately 12 years. His BMI comes in at 28.6 which classifies him as overweight. He is an ex-smoker  with a 30 pack-year history but quit 10 years ago. Recurrent angina at rest for the past six months prompted his most recent healthcare visit. He has never been diagnosed with any psychiatric illness.  Family History:  Mr. A's mother passed away at 67 due to stroke  and his father died at age 72 from a myocardial infarction. Both his parents had hypertension. He has one younger brother being treated for hypertension but has no history of diabetes  CAD or any other major health issue.  Clinical Examinations & Results: Upon physical examination  Mr. A's BP is measured at 145/90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive therapy  his resting HR is 82 bpm  and his labs confirm ongoing management for hyperglycemia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows possible left ventricular hypertrophy and a mild ST-depression indicating possible myocardial ischemia. His Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a slightly impaired left ventricular systolic function.   Diagnosis & Management Plan: Based on the clinical findings as well as the patient's past and family health histories  the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is made. The patient should be consulted for immediate lifestyle changes  including diet and physical activity  to help manage BMI as well as blood glucose level. Antihypertensive therapy should be reassessed and possibly adjusted. Prescription of low-dose aspirin  statin therapy  and anti-anginal drugs is recommended. Potential angioplasty or CABG might be suitable options in the long-term if the patient agrees  and the medical team deems it necessary.  In conclusion  preventative strategies and adequate control of existing conditions are of utmost importance given the patient's increased risk factors for CAD due to age  race  family history  and the presence of comorbidities. Regular follow-up to monitor and optimize treatment is also crucial.

Coronary artery disease,10,3,Patient Information: Patient: Mr. Richard Walker Age: 57 years Gender: Male Occupation: Plumber Ethnicity: Caucasian  Case Report:  Mr. Richard  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  came into the clinic complaining of chest discomfort  characterized by a heavy  squeezing sensation radiating to his left arm and jaw. Mr. Walker indicated this pain mainly occurs when he is physically active or emotionally stressed and that rest and sublingual nitroglycerin tablets seem to alleviate the pain.   Mr. Walker is a smoker with a 30-pack year history and a moderate drinker  consuming 2-4 beers on an average evening. He is a plumber who reports long work hours in a high-stress environment and an irregular  high-fat diet due to the demanding nature of his job. He has a body mass index of 29 kg/m2  indicating overweight. He doesn't partake in regular physical activity due to lack of time and motivation.  Richard's past medical history includes hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago  for which he sporadically takes antihypertensive medication. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 years. There's no history of diabetes mellitus in the family.  Concerning his symptoms  especially the chest discomfort  we suspect Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  given the nature of pain (exertional)  family history (early heart disease in father)  personal medical history (hypertension)  lifestyle habits (smoking  alcohol  high-fat diet  sedentary lifestyle)  age  and gender. However  we must perform diagnostic tests to confirm this suspicion.   Learning Point:   This case was designed to focus on coronary artery disease and its associated risk factors. The patient's history  the nature of pain  and risk factors confirm our suspicion of CAD. This case aims to emphasize the importance of a detailed history  patient lifestyle  heredity  and symptom patterns in diagnosing such conditions. The students could then focus on the importance of lifestyle changes  medication adherence  and regular follow-ups in the management of CAD. Further  they could learn about diagnostic tools such as electrocardiogram (ECG)  Exercise Stress Test  Coronary angiography  Cardiac CT  etc.

According to data from the American Heart Association  Hispanics are likely to have multiple factors such as diabetes and obesity that increase their risk of developing CAD  as is the case for the patient Mr. Ramos."
Coronary artery disease,10,6,"Patient Information:  Mr. John T  a 62-year-old African American male  retired mechanic  currently residing in an urban environment. His ethnicity and age heighten his susceptibility to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  considering the higher incidence of CAD among older African American men.  Past Medical History:  The patient has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was a smoker for about 25 years but quit 10 years ago. His father died at the age of 68 due to a myocardial infarction. This family history of CAD makes John genetically predisposed to the disease. The patient has a BMI of 32  indicating obesity.  Key Complaints:  John came to the clinic complaining about a recurrent discomfort in the chest area that he describes as a """"pressure-like"""" feeling  which sometimes radiates towards his left shoulder and arm. These symptoms tend to appear upon physical exertion like climbing stairs or doing yard work  and go away with rest or after ingesting nitroglycerin. Recently  he has also reported experiencing similar discomfort during moments of intense emotional stress.  He also mentioned incidents of unexplained fatigue  breathlessness  and bouts of lightheadedness. He has had three such episodes in the past month  which is causing him considerable anxiety.  These complaints are key features of the classic angina pectoris  hinting at a potential case of coronary artery disease. This represents the leading cause of death globally  so screening for CAD in high-risk individuals is crucial. Medical students reviewing this case should look into John’s medical history and symptoms for learning important aspects of CAD  its risk factors  diagnosis  and management strategies. "

In the past two days  the patient also started experiencing shortness of breath accompanying the chest pain.   Note: This case report accurately represents common demographic trends related to coronary artery disease; including age  race  socioeconomic status  and habits such as smoking and alcohol use. The co-morbidities of diabetes and hypertension emphasize the common risk factors linked to coronary artery disease. The family history of CAD-related myocardial infarction is an important aspect to consider given the hereditary tendencies of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,8,Case Report for Medical Training: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information: Patient name: Anonymous Age: 62 years  Sex: Male Race: African American  Occupation: Retired engineer Location: Urban  Midwest  USA  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He has been known to have hypertension for the last 11 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 8 years. Both conditions were managed with medication: amlodipine for hypertension and metformin for diabetes. Despite the regimen  the patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels are not well-controlled. The patient also has a family history of coronary artery disease  with his father having suffered a heart attack at 58 years.  Key Complaints: Over the last month  Mr. A has experienced intermittent chest pain that has progressively become more frequent and intense. Initially  the pain often occurred with exertion  such as when walking his dog or climbing stairs. However  the pain has now started to interfere with his daily activities  sometimes waking him up from his sleep. The pain is described as a squeezing pressure behind his breastbone  radiating down his left arm  and is often accompanied by shortness of breath. The patient denies any associated diaphoresis  nausea  or vomiting.   The case has been designed considering the literature data which pinpoints that coronary artery disease is more commonly seen in males over 50 years  has a strong genetic component and is frequently associated with lifestyle diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Smoking and race  particularly in African Americans  are also significant risk factors.
Coronary artery disease,10,9,Case Report:  Patient Profile: The patient is a Hispanic 62-year-old male  named Mr. A. From a socioeconomic perspective  the patient comes from a lower middle-class background and works as a plumber. He has been living in urban Los Angeles  California  for the past 35 years  and is a current smoker.  Past Medical History: The patient has a notable medical history for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both these medical conditions have been managed with medication for the past ten years  with suboptimal control due to non-compliance with prescribed drugs and irregular follow-ups. He denies any history of lung disease or renal disorders. There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 54.  Key Complaint: Mr. A presents with a two-hour history of severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and arm. The pain came on at rest and has been persistent  unlike his previous history of mild angina  which was relieved with rest. In addition  he is experiencing profuse sweating  nausea  and shortness of breath.  Given the demographic representation of coronary artery disease (CAD) in literature  this case intersects various risk factors: male gender  increasing age  Hispanic heritage  lower socioeconomic status  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  family history  and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. This serves as an appropriate case to train medical students on recognizing and managing coronary artery disease effectively.
Coronary artery disease,10,10,"Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Demographics:  Name: Allen Smith  Age: 59   Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired Banker   Location: Rural Midwest  USA   Lifestyle: Sedentary   BMI: 28   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith is a 59-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 15 years. His medications include Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily and Atorvastatin 20mg once daily. He is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago after a 30-year history of 1 pack/day. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. He does not have diabetes  and there is no history of stroke  kidney disease  or liver disease.   Complaints/ Presenting Problems:  Over the past month  Mr. Smith has experienced episodes of exertional chest pain that subsides with rest. These episodes typically last for 5 to 10 minutes and are often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. More recently  these episodes have become more frequent and of greater intensity. Mr. Smith reports the pain as """"a heavy pressure"""" in the center of his chest. He denies experiencing any associated symptoms like syncope  palpitations  nausea or vomiting. He does not report any worsening of these symptoms at rest or during the night.   Considering Mr. Smith's risk factors (age  male sex  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of heart disease  and smoking) along with his present symptoms of exertional chest pain  the case is designed to mimic a typical patient profile of coronary artery disease. The aim is to help medical students understand how to identify the symptoms and initiate appropriate assessment  management  and preventative measures.   Literature supports the risk profile of this case; the demographics represent the most significant segment of the population affected by coronary artery disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  including coronary artery disease (CAD)  is more common in men  particularly those older than 45 years. Race and ethnic background also contribute  with CAD more prevalent among Caucasians. Risk factors like hypertension  dyslipidemia  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of early heart disease are consistent with typical CAD patients according to medical literature."

He has controlled hypertension  on a regimen of Lisinopril for the past 5 years.  He has no history of heart disease but mentions that his father had a heart attack at a similar age.   Lifestyle:  Mr. Johnson is a former smoker  he quit 15 years ago  having smoked a pack a day for 30 years. He drinks alcohol sparingly  having a glass of wine or two during special occasions. He maintains a diet that is high in red meats and processed foods. Activity has notably decreased since retirement; he admits it is now limited to chores around the house.  Family History: His father died at age 72 from a myocardial infarction. His mother died at age 75 from a stroke. He has two older siblings  a sister who is 70 and healthy  and a brother who is 72 and has isolated systolic hypertension.  Review of Systems: Denies: Fever  chills  cough  nausea  vomiting  lower extremity edema  palpitations  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reports increased fatigue in recent months.   In this training case  understand that while all symptoms and history should be considered  the focus should be on the key presenting cardiovascular symptoms of angina and dyspnea. The patient's risk factors  including age  diabetes  hypertension  prior smoking and family history of cardiovascular disease  should guide the medical students to consider Coronary Artery Disease. This case is representative of the demographic most likely to experience CAD  which is older  Caucasian males."
Coronary artery disease,10,17,Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. John Davis Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Urban Socio-economic Status: Middle-Class  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for 10 years managed with Lisinopril. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 5 years managed with Metformin. 3. Occasional Tachycardia. 4. Raised cholesterol levels noted two years ago. 5. Family history of heart disease (Father died of heart attack  aged 72). 6. No known allergies. 7. Non-smoker but a history of tobacco use in his 30s. 8. Moderate alcohol usage of around 4-6 units per week. 9. No history of illegal drugs usage. 10. Exercises irregularly due to fatigue.  Key Complaints: Mr. Davis presents with the chief complaint of intermittent chest discomfort over the past 2 weeks. He describes it as a 'heavy' sensation concentrated in the center of his chest  sometimes radiating to his left shoulder and arm. The episodes usually last for about 5-10 minutes and often occur when he is climbing stairs or doing some other form of exertion. He also reports associated dyspnea on exertion. He noted that the chest discomfort improves with rest. Occasionally  he has also experienced episodes of sudden onset palpitations  anxiety  and cold sweats.  These symptoms have been increasing in frequency over the past week  which have subsequently led to him avoiding physical activity due to fear of triggering the chest discomfort. He denies experiencing symptoms at rest or at night. There is no reported nausea  vomiting  or dizziness. His appetite and sleep pattern remain normal. However  he noted the likely unrelated occurrence of polyuria over the past week.
Coronary artery disease,10,18,Case Report:  Patient Profile:   - Name: John Doe - Age: 66 - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Social History: History of smoking (quit 10 years ago)  occasional alcohol consumption - Family History: Father had myocardial infarction at age 70  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension since age 45  current BP control below 140/90 mmHg through Lisinopril 10mg daily. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 58  managed by Metformin 500mg  twice daily. 3. Hypercholesterolemia  on Atorvastatin 20mg  once daily.  Presenting Complaints:  John presented to the emergency department complaining of recurrent chest pain that started two weeks ago. He described the pain as a heavy pressure located in the center and left side of his chest. The pain radiates to his left arm and becomes significant after physical exertion  particularly when walking uphill or against the wind  and during periods of emotional stress. It typically lasts for about 10-15 minutes and subsides with rest. The pain has become increasingly frequent over the last couple of days. He reported a need to stop three times during a 200-yard walk due to unbearable pain. He also noticed he gets easily fatigued. He has associated symptoms of shortness of breath  nausea  and perspiration.  Background: This case is designed to highlight typical symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD)  an ailment very common among men over the age of 65  particularly in those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia and smoking. CAD is under-diagnosed and under-treated in the elderly  resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. Presented symptoms suggest stable angina  that recently became unstable and thus require immediate work up and management to prevent myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease,10,19,Case Report: Patient Demographics: The patient is a 66-year-old African American male with a Body Mass Index of 30. He is a retired construction worker  hails from lower socioeconomic strata  and currently lives with his wife.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both are managed under proper medication since the last seven years. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for approximately 20 years but quit 15 years ago. There have been occasional episodes of chest pain over the past one year  although not severe enough to warrant a visit to the hospital. The patient does not have a family history of coronary artery disease. His father had type 2 diabetes and his mother suffered from hypertension. The patient's current medication regimen includes a thiazide diuretic and a statin.  Key Complaints: The patient presents with a two-day history of constant and nagging angina at rest that has recently extended to his left arm. The pain is described as severe with a score of 8/10 and pressure-like in nature  not relieved by nitroglycerin. He also reports shortness of breath  fatigue  dizziness  and a sense of impending doom. The angina episodes are more frequent and last longer than his previous episodes. He denies any symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. Due to his multiple co-morbidities  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  his history of smoking along with the symptoms he has presented  our main differential diagnosis is coronary artery disease (CAD).   (Note: This case has been designed keeping in mind that coronary artery disease is more prevalent among older adults  particularly men  and among people of African descent. Factors like socio-economic status  lifestyle choices such as historical smoking  obesity  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia also contribute to the risk of CAD. However  it should be kept in mind that CAD can affect anyone regardless of age  gender  ethnicity or socio-economic status.)
Coronary artery disease,10,20,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Information:   Ms. Eugenia Richardson  a 65-year-old African-American female  presents to the clinic.  Medical History:  Ms. Richardson's medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which are both well-controlled with medications. She has a history of smoking for the past 30 years and reports occasional alcohol use. She is currently overweight with a BMI of 28. Eugenia's mother suffered from coronary artery disease and passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72.  Chief Complaints:  For the past several weeks  Ms. Richardson complains of gradually worsening exertional chest pain that usually occurs after walking about two city blocks and is relieved by rest within 10 minutes. She characterizes the pain as a “pressure” in the middle of her chest. She has also noticed shortness of breath with this exertional pain  a feeling of tiredness that lasts for a few hours afterward  and occasional dizziness. The patient denies any symptoms when she is resting. She does not have associated sweating  palpitations  or syncope.   The case was designed considering the high prevalence of CAD in individuals above 65 years  especially in African-Americans. A significant aspect of this case is her gender  as CAD is often misdiagnosed in women who present with atypical symptoms. Her risk factors include her age  race  family history  smoking history  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and being overweight. These are important considerations for diagnosis and management of CAD. The patient’s exertional angina is a typical symptom expected in a CAD patient.   Please note  this case should encourage students to think about managing her risk factors as a part of a comprehensive treatment plan for CAD. It also aims to emphasize the importance of recognizing CAD in women  who may not present with “classic” symptoms.
Coronary artery disease,10,21,"Case Report:   Patient Information:  Mr. DeShawn Brown is a 60-year-old African-American male who is a retired high school science teacher. He is a widower and lives alone in the inner city. He has publicly funded insurance and visits the clinic every six months.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 10 years ago. He is on medication for both  specifically diuretics and statin. He is also a 20 pack-year smoker but quit 5 years ago. He states he exercises occasionally but admits his diet is often high in fat and sodium due to his reliance on fast food and takeaways. His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 66.  Key Complaints:  Over the past two months  Mr. Brown has been experiencing episodes of chest discomfort. These episodes occur more frequently during physical exertion  such as when climbing stairs  and less frequently when at rest. The discomfort generally resolves within 5-10 minutes of ceasing the activity. Mr. Brown notes that occasionally  the discomfort feels like a heavy pressure pressing on his chest  and he may also experience profuse sweating and feeling of discomfort radiating to his jaw and left arm. He initially attributed these symptoms to indigestion but now is concerned that it may be """"something serious like a heart problem.""""  This case evaluates a typical presentation of a patient at risk of coronary artery disease  given his demographic profile  medical history  and symptoms. The students should assess Mr. Brown  focusing on his cardiovascular system and should consider diagnostic tests like an EKG or a stress test. Considering African Americans have higher rates of hypertension and subsequent heart disease  this case offers an opportunity to discuss health disparities as well."
Coronary artery disease,10,22,Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Demographics: - Patient Initials: J.D. - Gender: Male - Age: 58 years - Race: African American - Occupation: Sales Manager - Social History: Smoke a pack of cigarette a day for the last 25 years  alcohol consumption is moderate to heavy  sedentary lifestyle with high stress levels at work  high fat diet.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Type II Diabetes five years ago  currently managed by Metformin. - History of Hypertension for over a decade  controlled with Lisinopril.  - Elevated cholesterol level (LDL >130 mg/dL) for the past five years.  - His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.  Key Complaints: J.D. has been experiencing exertional chest pain for the past two weeks. The pain usually comes on after climbing stairs or during intense arguments at work. It's a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest that eases up at rest. He also reported mild shortness of breath and fatigue this past week.  Over the last two days  JD has noticed the chest pain is more frequent and has been waking him up from sleep  he also feels increasingly sweaty with these episodes. He denies any nausea  vomiting  or radiation of pain. J.D. is concerned about these growing symptoms due to his family history and has decided to seek medical help.   ------- This case represents a typical presentation and risk factor profile for coronary artery disease  including age  male gender  African American race  smoking history  presence of type II diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia and family history of premature CAD. The key complaints align with a suspected diagnosis of unstable angina or possible acute coronary syndrome. This case should form the basis of discussion on measures of acute management  diagnosing the severity of CAD (like coronary catheterization)  and long-term lifestyle modifications. It can also introduce the topic of healthcare disparities  as CAD mortality rates are higher in African Americans  partially due to lower rates of disease awareness  risk factor control  and access to care.
Coronary artery disease,10,23,Case Report:  Demographics:   Mr. Brown  a 62-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past eight years and is taking oral hypoglycemic agents. He has also been suffering from hypertension for ten years  under control with medication. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history  though he quit smoking five years ago. He has a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD); his father suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Mr. Brown has a sedentary lifestyle and follows an unhealthy diet  high in saturated fats and sugars. He has been diagnosed with obesity based on his body mass index (BMI).  Key Complaints:  Mr. Brown visited his primary healthcare provider following 4 weeks of intermittent  dull chest discomfort that radiates to the left arm. The symptoms often occur during physical activity like climbing stairs and are relieved by rest. Occasionally  he also experiences shortness of breath after minor exertion and episodes of night sweats. Over the last few weeks  he has felt unusually fatigued. He shared that he has been feeling unusually stressed lately due to work pressures which he feels might be causing these issues.  The training case should then move to appropriate investigations  including blood tests  stress test  ECG  echocardiogram  and coronary angiography if indicated by his symptoms  risk factors and initial investigations. It should discuss possible outcomes (stable angina  unstable angina  myocardial infarction) and how to differentiate them  as well as potential treatment options such as lifestyle changes  medication  stenting  or bypass surgery. The case should emphasize comprehensive patient care including diet  physical activity  mental health  and close follow-up  particularly important given Mr. Brown's demographic and preexisting conditions. It should also explore challenges associated with adherence to medication and lifestyle changes in patients with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Medication side effects  drug interactions and contraindications should also be discussed  given Mr. Brown's multiple health conditions.
Coronary artery disease,10,24,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. James Smith  a 65-year-old African American male  with an occupation as a long-haul truck driver  currently residing in Birmingham  Alabama is presenting at the clinic today.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both conditions have been managed with medication (Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes and Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for hypertension) for the past 7 years. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit 5 years ago. The patient admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in sodium and saturated fats. There is a family history of heart disease - his father experienced a myocardial infarction at 62.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith came to the clinic reporting recurring chest pain for the past several weeks. He describes the pain as a heavy pressure in the middle of his chest which intensifies with physical exertion  particularly after meals  but gets relieved with rest. He also reports episodes of shortness of breath and profuse sweating during these incidents. In the last few days  he has noted the pain seems more intense and is beginning to worry him.  This clinical picture suggests possible stable angina  a common presentation of coronary artery disease. Notice that the risk factors include older age  male sex  African American ethnicity  occupational sedentariness  hypertension  diabetes  smoking history  unhealthy diet  and familial predisposition.  Further investigations  including EKG  stress test  and possibly coronary angiography  will be required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. Management would then focus on lifestyle modification  medical therapy and possibly intervention as indicated.

Coronary artery disease,10,26,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. John Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a retired banker currently residing in the suburbs of Michigan  USA.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for the past seven years. He is a former smoker  having quit five years ago but had a 20 pack-year history before that. There's a familial history of cardiovascular diseases; his father passed away in his mid-sixties due to myocardial infarction  and his elder brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) as well. Mr. Smith has been maintaining a sub-optimal diet rich in saturated fats and low on fresh fruits and vegetables  and leading a sedentary life.  Key Complaints: For the past month  Mr. Smith has been experiencing intermittent chest tightness and discomfort  often occurring after indulging in meals or slight physical exertion. Initially  these episodes were relieved by rest within a few minutes. However  in the past week  he has noticed that the episodes have been increasing with both frequency and intensity  and lasting longer. In the last couple of days  this chest discomfort has been radiating to the left arm and has been accompanied by shortness of breath. He has also noted some excessive fatigue and recent episodes of dizziness.  Comments: This case is designed to provide an examination of a typical presentation of stable coronary artery disease advancing towards unstable angina. It includes key risk components such as hypertension  diabetes mellitus  a history of smoking  sub-optimal dietary habits  sedentary lifestyle  and a strong familial tendency. On discussion  focus should be on the interpretation of symptoms  potential differential diagnoses  prompt identification of CAD  and the medical management of the disease. It also highlights the need for lifestyle modifications and promotion of a heart-healthy regimen for prevention of such cases.
Coronary artery disease,10,27,Case Report   Patient Information: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  named John.  Past Medical History:  John is a high-risk patient with a substantial medical history including diabetes (Type 2  diagnosed at age 51)  hypertension (on therapy with ramipril)  hyperlipidemia (on statins therapy)  and a 25-pack year history of smoking  but quit 10 years ago. He also has a family history of early coronary artery disease.  Key Complaints: John came to the clinic with complaints of chest pain for the past six months. He experiences discomfort and pressure in his chest  particularly during activities like walking uphill or under stressful conditions. He typically notices relief after rest. Additionally  new onset shortness of breath on exertion over the past few weeks is also a matter of concern.  On further investigation  John admits that he is experiencing bouts of fatigue more frequently. He also remarks a decrease in his ability to perform household activities due to the recent symptoms.   He is worried about his health  particularly because of the substantial family history of coronary artery disease. His father had a heart attack at the age of 55 and his older brother at age 58. As relevant social history  he is retired  lives with his wife  and has a moderate alcohol intake.   This case is designed to educate medical students on one of the leading causes of death globally - coronary artery disease. It reflects demographic predilections  including age and ethnic predisposition  lifestyle factors including smoking  diet  drinking  and stress  as well as comorbidities like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia which are all vital components in the real-world presentation of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,28,Case Subject: Mr. Elijah Stevens  Patient Information:  -Age: 64 -Gender: Male -Race: African American -Occupation: Retired engineer -Demographics: Lives in a suburban area  widowed  lives alone  Past Medical History:  1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – Diagnosed 8 years ago  managed with Metformin. 2. Hypertension – Diagnosed 5 years ago  on Lisinopril. 3. Hyperlipidemia - Diagnosed 3 years ago  managed with Atorvastatin. 4. Smoking – Average of one pack daily for the last 30 years  quit one year ago. 5. No known drug allergies 6.

He especially notices the pain during his daily walks with his dog and occasionally when doing household chores. He shared that this pain sometimes radiates to his left shoulder and subsides with rest. He also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath and unusual fatigue recently.  These signs and symptoms indicate possible coronary artery disease. Mr. Stevens' potential risk factors  including advanced age  history of Type 2 Diabetes  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  long period of smoking  and familial history  underscore the need for early diagnosis and targeted treatment management. The next steps should include further investigations  such as blood tests  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  and possibly a Treadmill Test (TMT) or angiogram to confirm the diagnosis.  As future medical professionals  it is crucial for the students to understand the importance of early detection of coronary artery disease symptoms  especially in patients with multiple risk factors  in order to prevent further complications  including heart attack and heart failure.  This case provides an excellent opportunity to understand disease presentation  risk factors  investigation  and management of a highly prevalent condition like coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,29,Case Report:  Patient Information:  The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male who is an employee in a law firm. He is a smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. His BMI (Body Mass Index) is 29  hence he falls in the overweight category. He does not engage in any regular physical exercise and reports a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD).  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of high blood pressure and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago. Both conditions are under control with medication. He also had an episode of atrial fibrillation two years ago. His medication includes Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and an OAC (Oral Anticoagulant) for atrial fibrillation. Furthermore  he experienced a minor heart attack a decade ago.   Chief Complaints:  He presented at the hospital complaining of occasional chest discomfort radiating to the left arm  especially during physical exertion or stress. He also reported symptoms of excessive fatigue and shortness of breath.  This case aligns with the epidemiological literature as coronary artery disease is shown to be more prevalent among aged  African-American males  who have risk factors like diabetes  high blood pressure  physical inactivity  overweight  and has familial prevalence of CAD. Furthermore  the incidence of CAD is reported to be higher in people with unhealthy lifestyle habits  such as smoking and drinking.
Coronary artery disease,10,30,"Patient Profile:  Name: John Smith Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired  previously worked as an industrial engineer Place of residence: Urban area Marital Status: Married Insurance Status: Medicare   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension – diagnosed 10 years ago and under medication 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – diagnosed 5 years ago; manages it with diet  exercise  and metformin 3. Hyperlipidemia - managed with statins for past 7 years 4. Negative for previous strokes or TIAs 5. Ex-Smoker  quit 15 years ago (30-pack-year history) 6. Regular alcohol consumption  within advised limits 7. No known drug allergies  Current Complaints: Over the past few weeks  he has been experiencing episodes of discomfort in the chest that he describes as """"pressure""""  typically occurring during moderate physical activity  like walking uphill or gardening  and usually relieved by rest. The discomfort lasts for about 10-15 minutes each time. Additionally  he reported episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue during daily activities that he initially assumed were due to aging.  Demographics referencing literature: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is generally more prevalent in males. It is most common in individuals older than 60 years of age and is frequently associated with conditions like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. As per literature  CAD is more prevalent among Caucasians compared to other races. Behavioral risk factors such as smoking and alcohol also have a well-established link with CAD. Although this case presents an ex-smoker  the history of extensive smoking puts the patient at risk.   The lifestyle and past medical history of the patient place him at high risk. These symptoms suggest a potential angina due to CAD  and the medical students should be guided to investigate further into this diagnostic possibility."
Coronary artery disease,10,31,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Smith  Age: 58 Race: Caucasian Gender: Male Occupation: Corporate Lawyer Relationship Status: Married with two children  Demographics:  John Smith is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  currently working as a corporate lawyer. He is married with two adult children and lives in a suburb. He is a smoker and has been for approximately 40 years  averaging about 20 cigarettes a day. He also has moderate alcohol consumption  drinking socially around twice a week. He doesn't exercise frequently due to his demanding job.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a family history of heart diseases  specifically  his father died at the age of 62 from myocardial infarction. Additionally  his mother was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol in her late 50s. John was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes five years ago and has also been struggling with obesity and hypertension for the past 10 years. He has been irregular with his diabetes and hypertension medications  attributing this to his busy work schedule.   Key Complaints:  John visited the clinic presenting new onset of chest discomfort he has been experiencing especially with activity. He describes it as a pressure-like sensation which is relieved by rest. Additionally  he has also noticed shortness of breath with minimal exertion  unusual fatigue  and occasional feelings of lightheadedness. He also mentioned intermittent episodes of heartburn-like symptoms. He assumed these to be related to his workload and stress  however  given his past medical history and recent increase in symptoms  he thought it best to get it checked.  This scenario involving a middle-aged  Caucasian male with a significant smoking history and poor control of his diabetes and hypertension is typical of the presentation of a patient at risk for coronary artery disease. The symptoms described by the patient - chest discomfort with exertion  shortness of breath  and heartburn-like symptoms - are suggestive of stable angina  a common manifestation of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,32,"Patient Case Report  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe is a 69-year-old African American male  residing in an urban setting in Alabama. He has been an active smoker for the past 35 years and reports a sedentary lifestyle. He is a retired construction worker now living with his wife. His BMI suggests he is under the obesity category.  Past Medical History (PMH): Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago. His family history reveals that his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 73  and his older brother is suffering from coronary artery disease. Previously  he has been non-compliant regarding his hypertension and diabetes management  opting for sporadic medication and poor diet control.  Present Complaint: Over the past few weeks  Mr. Doe has been complaining of episodic chest discomfort  especially after exertion  that seems to relieve on rest. The pain can be described as """"pressure"""" in the middle of the chest  sometimes radiating to the left arm. Also  he has been experiencing associated shortness of breath  fatigue  and lightheadedness. Recently  he reported a severe bout of chest pain during one of his leisure walks  which made him stop and sit down until the pain subsided. Seeing the frequency of these episodes increase over time  his wife insisted on seeking medical advice.  Given his cardiovascular risk factors - notably ethnicity  age  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  and obesity  along with poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes - Mr. Doe is at a high risk of coronary artery disease. His typical angina symptoms of chest discomfort on exertion  relieved by rest  navigates the diagnosis towards stable angina. The advancing severity  however  suggests it might be progressing towards unstable angina  indicating the possible onset of acute coronary syndrome.   The trainees should be guided to consider the patient's increasing episodes of angina as a “red flag ” highlighting the importance of immediate intervention  rigorous risk factor management  and educating the patient about lifestyle modifications. This case hence underscores the importance of early diagnosis and management in preventing the complications of coronary artery disease."
Coronary artery disease,10,33,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male named Mr. Smith. He is a retired teacher and is married with two adult children. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He lives in an urban setting and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to limited physical mobility caused by knee osteoarthritis.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes metformin  and hypertension controlled with lisinopril. He has been obese (BMI: 31.2) with a history of poor diet control. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith presents to the clinic with recurrent chest pain occurring primarily during physical exertion (such as climbing stairs) for the past two months. The pain is described as a heavy  squeezing feeling in the middle of his chest area  lasting about 10-15 minutes  and is alleviated by rest. He also endorses shortness of breath  excessive sweatiness during the episodes  and general fatigue  which have worsened over the same period. No symptoms of dizziness  syncope  palpitations  or lower limb swelling.  In designing this case  the patient’s demographics have been purposely chosen to reflect significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. Mr. Smith's age  ethnicity  gender  and urban domicile present as societal risk factors. Additionally  his lifestyle and personal medical history  including obesity  diabetes  hypertension  and family history of heart disease  also make him prone to this condition. His chief complaints  their pattern  and associations  are highly indicative of angina pectoris  a common symptom of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,34,Case Title: Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis in a Senior Patient  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. James Watson  Age: 65 years  Gender: Male  Profession: Retired engineer Ethnicity: African-American Location: Urban area in the United States  Medical History: - History of hypertension for the past 10 years  currently under treatment with an ACE inhibitor and diuretic. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 7 years ago  controlled by Metformin. - Previous smoker  quit 5 years ago. - No previous history of cardiac disorders in himself  but a family history of heart disease (Father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72). - Regular medication includes Lisinopril  Hydrochlorothiazide  Metformin  and a daily aspirin. - Occasional alcohol intake and sedentary lifestyle.   - No known drug allergies.  Key complaints: - Intermittent chest discomfort for the past two months. The discomfort has been progressive in nature and has been associated with exertion (climbing stairs  gardening) and relieved by rest. - Shortness of breath after walking for a few blocks  which was not present earlier. - No complaints of orthopnea  PND  or ankle swelling. - Atypical symptoms include fatigue and vague epigastric discomfort.  Note: CAD primarily affects population groups over the age of 65 and above  and is more prevalent in African-Americans compared to Caucasians. Male gender  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  smoking  sedentary lifestyles  and family history are significant risk factors for CAD according to literature.   Objective: Teach students to identify the significance of patient history  risk factors and the necessity of early intervention in managing CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,35,"Case Title: An unexpected Vulnerability: Coronary Artery Disease in a Middle-aged Woman   Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Leah Thompson Age: 62 Years Sex: Female Race: African-American Profession: School Teacher (retired) Residential Area: Urban   Past Medical History: Mrs. Thompson has a past significant for hypertension  controlled with Amlodipine 10 mg daily  type-2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin 500 mg twice daily. She had a cholecystectomy 8 years ago and is nonsmoker  with occasional alcohol consumption. There is a family history of coronary artery disease  with her father passing from a heart attack at the age of 72.  Chief Complaints: Mrs. Thompson came in with complaints of intermittent chest discomfort for the past two months  which she initially attributed to """"indigestion""""  but recently noticed an increase in frequency and intensity following physical exertion. The discomfort is central  squeezing in nature  and relieved by rest. In the past few days  she has been experiencing shortness of breath and easy fatigablity on minimal exertion like climbing stairs or walking a short distance  which is unusual for her.  NOTE: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a prevalent condition in the Western countries. According to the literature  it affects both sexes  but in women  the symptoms usually manifest after the age of 50  post-menopause. Hypertension  diabetes mellitus and family history are known risk factors for CAD. African-Americans are revealed to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for CAD such as hypertension and diabetes. Thus  this case is designed to represent an accurate demographic profile in the context of CAD."
Coronary artery disease,10,36,"Case Title: Coronary Artery Disease in an Elderly Female Patient  Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Sandra Richardson Age: 68 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher Insurance: Medicare Location: Suburban  Midwest USA  Medical History:  Mrs. Richardson has been relatively healthy throughout her life except for a diagnosis of hypertension and hyperlipidemia 12 years ago  which are well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atorvastatin 40mg nightly). She had a remote smoking history of 15-pack-years but quit 20 years ago. She has a family history of heart disease - her father died from a heart attack at age 72  and her sister underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at age 65. Mrs. Richardson maintains an active lifestyle  involving gardening and daily walking. Her diet is reasonably balanced  albeit with a fondness for cheeses and pastries.  Key Complaints:  Over the past three weeks  Mrs. Richardson has been experiencing discomfort in her chest  describing it as a """"pressure"""" that often radiates down her left arm. These symptoms usually occur when she tends to her garden or walks slightly faster than her regular pace  and seems to ease with rest.  This scenario represents a typical """"angina pectoris"""" case  a clinical marker for coronary artery disease frequently seen in elderly people  particularly common among those with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and familial predisposition.  Case Follow-Up:  The next stage of the training case will involve exploring the clinical examinations and investigations (like an ECG  Stress Test  and possibly Coronary Angiogram) needed to confirm the diagnosis  initiating relevant treatment based on the findings (ranging from medications  coronary angioplasty  or bypass surgery)  and discussing preventative measures to inhibit the disease's progression and improve the patient's quality of life.   (Note that the above case is representative but does not represent all presentations of coronary artery disease. Some patients might present atypically  especially women  diabetic patients  and older adults)"
Coronary artery disease,10,37,Case Report  Patient Demographic Data:   Mr. Joel Rivera  a 62-year-old Hispanic male of Puerto Rican descent  presents to the clinic. He is a retired factory worker with a limited English proficiency and relies on his daughter as his primary translator. He is married  a father to three children  and lives in a suburban neighborhood.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rivera has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which has been controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents for the past five years. Additionally  he has a mild form of Hypertension  controlled by diet and medication. There is no known history of cancer  stroke  or any surgical interventions. He suffers from obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. He is a former smoker but quit approximately ten years ago. His father had a history of cardiovascular disease and passed away from a heart attack at the age of 68.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents with a two-week history of intermittent  dull chest discomfort that often escalates to sharp pain. These episodes are typically experienced in the morning  lasting for about 10-15 minutes  and often relieved by rest. He notes the pain tends to appear more likely during his walks. He denies experiencing the pain at rest. He also reports recent onset shortness of breath on exertion  fatigue  occasional dizziness  but denies nausea  sweating  or heart palpitations. The symptoms have increased progressively  causing him to seek medical attention.  In light of the patient's background  history  and symptoms  there is a strong possibility of coronary artery disease (CAD). The history of diabetes and hypertension  obesity  and family history of CAD increases his risk significantly. His ethnicity and gender also place him in a higher risk bracket  as CAD has been documented to affect Hispanic males disproportionately. The next step would involve further testing to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of possible cardiac damage  informing treatment.   This concise case report can become an effective tool for the medical teaching environment  highlighting the clinical suspicion and investigation of CAD in a patient with traditional risk factors  including ethnicity. It emphasizes how social determinants of health  language barriers  and cultural background can impact patients' health literacy  perception of disease  and delay in seeking medical attention.
Coronary artery disease,10,38,Case: Mr. Johnson   Patient Demographics:   Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired and lives with his wife in an urban setting. He is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history. He quit smoking 10 years ago. He has a moderate alcohol intake and his diet is high in fat and salt. He occasionally takes walks in the park  but generally has a low level of physical activity.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia  both are treated with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). He also has a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD)  his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presented with a one-week history of episodic chest pain that typically occurred with exertion and was relieved by rest. He described the pain as a heavy pressure in the center of his chest  which occasionally radiates to his left arm. Over the last 24 hours  he noticed that the pain has increased in severity and frequency  at times occurring at rest. He also reported some shortness of breath associated with the chest pain episodes. He denied any symptoms of nausea  vomiting  palpitations  or syncope.  This case is designed to mimic a rather typical presentation of a male patient with CAD. According to literature  CAD is more prevalent in males over 60 (especially in post-menopausal women)  and risk factors like hypertension  dyslipidemia  smoking  sedentary lifestyle  poor diet  and family history are not uncommon. Lastly  symptoms of angina (exertional chest pain) progressing to unstable episodes points to a worsening CAD condition  which requires immediate medical attention.
Coronary artery disease,10,39,"Patient Information:  Mr. Thomas Schaeffer  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who works as a construction manager  presents to the clinic. His BMI measures 28  indicating overweight status. He is a smoker with a history of 40-pack years and admits to drinking alcohol socially. He lives with his wife in a suburban setting.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Schaeffer has been diagnosed with hypertension and borderline Type 2 diabetes  for which he is prescribed medication. His past surgical history includes an appendectomy at age 17. His family history includes a father who died at age 60 due to myocardial infarction and a mother with hypertension. He has no known drug allergies.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Schaeffer reports experiencing intermittent chest pain for the past two months  specifically after activities such as climbing stairs or lifting heavy materials at work. He describes the pain as """"feeling like there's a heavy weight on my chest."""" He also mentions shortness of breath accompanying the chest pain. He initially dismissed the pain  thinking it was due to stress or indigestion. However  over the past week  he noticed the pain occurring more frequently and with less exertion. He has not experienced any sweating  nausea  vomiting  or fainting spells.   Possible Diagnoses:  Yes  the patient's features are consistent with possible ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD). His age  gender  obesity  diabetes  hypertension  smoking history  and positive family history of early death due to heart disease all increase the likelihood of CAD as the source of his symptoms. His described discomfort and precipitating factors are also classic for exertional angina pectoris caused by CAD.   Clinical Approach:  In Mr. Schaeffer's case  the immediate next step should be performing an ECG to look for any acute or chronic changes suggesting ischemia or infarction and cardiac biomarkers should be checked. He should be evaluated for stable angina given his recurring pain with exertion. His risk factors should be modified (statin  ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker prescript for hypertension  glycemic control  weight management  smoking cessation). He should have either an exercise stress test or stress echocardiography  but if those are positive or inconclusive  further evaluation with coronary angiography would be needed to visualize the coronary anatomy and determine potential need for revascularization."

He also reports shortness of breath  fatigue  profuse sweating  and occasional lightheadedness.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 60  controlled with oral antidiabetic medications. - History of hypertension for 6 years  controlled with Losartan. - Had an episode of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) at age 63. - 40 pack-years history of smoking but quit 8 years ago. - Occasional alcohol consumption. - Father died of a heart attack at age 74.    Social History: The patient lives with his wife in a high-stress environment. They have adult children who live separately. He is a retired truck driver and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle. During a dietary inquiry  it was found that he regularly consumes a diet high in salt  sugar and saturated fats.  Review of Systems: - Cardiovascular: Suffering from intermittent chest pain (typical angina) and occasional palpitations - Respiratory: Reports of shortness of breath  especially on exertion - Others: No significant changes in gastrointestinal  musculoskeletal or neurological systems. Negative for fever  weight loss  cough  or hemoptysis.  Physical Examination: - General: Well-nourished  not in acute distress - Vitals: BP - 140/90 mm Hg; HR - 78 bpm  regular; RR - 16 breaths per min; Temp - 98.6 F - Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds  no murmurs; pulse regular; no edema in extremities. - Respiratory: No abnormal lung sounds. - Other Systems: No significant findings.  Anticipated Learning Objectives: 1) Understanding the risk factors and pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. 2) Recognizing the signs and symptoms of CAD and its complications. 3) Developing focused management and treatment strategies for CAD. 4) Understanding and advocating for lifestyle modification in the prevention of CAD. 5) Promoting patient empathy and improving communication skills.
Coronary artery disease,10,41,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: John Smith  Age: 65 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Truck Driver Residence: Urban area  Midwest Marital status: Married  Past Medical History: • Hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with Amlodipine. • Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the last 7 years  managed with Metformin. • Chronic smoker (30 pack-year history). • No known allergies.  Key Complaints: John presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-hour history of retrosternal chest pain  described as a pressure-like sensation that radiates to his left arm. The pain has been constant and was not relieved by rest. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea. No episodes of loss of consciousness  palpitation  or presyncopal attacks. Denies a cough  fever  or recent travel. Has been compliant with his medication but reports a recent increase in general fatigue.  Based on the demographic representation found in literature  it’s apparent that Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is more common among older adults  particularly men  and those with a history of long-standing hypertension and type 2 diabetes as is our patient  Mr. Smith. His occupational history as a truck driver suggests a lifestyle with extended periods of sedentary behavior and potentially unhealthy dietary habits  which are risk factors for CAD. Furthermore  long-term smoking history makes him more vulnerable to CAD.  Students should explore  in this case  the interplay of these risk factors for CAD and identify essential assessments to be made and immediate interventions to be implemented based on the symptoms presented. They should also consider the role of health education about lifestyle modification and disease management for such patients. Overall  Mr. Smith's case offers a comprehensive learning opportunity about CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,42,Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics: Mr. S  a 64-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  residing in an urban neighborhood in New York. Smoker with a 20-year history of one pack a day. Has a BMI of 28. Doesn't do regular exercise and follows a high saturated fat diet.  Past Medical History: Mr. S has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last decade  controlled on medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). He was diagnosed with Type-II Diabetes Melitus 5 years ago. He had undergone a successful appendectomy in his early twenties. There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease - his father had a myocardial infarction at 62 and died from a stroke at 72. His older sister underwent coronary bypass surgery at 67.  Key Complaints: Mr. S presents with complaints of intermittent chest pain for the last three months  which he initially attributed to acid reflux. The pain has been increasing in intensity  described as a ‘heavy’ sensation  radiating to his left arm. It occurs mostly with exertion and is relieved with rest. In the last two days  he has noticed that it's no longer linked only to physical effort but also occurs while he is at rest. He has also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath after minimal physical efforts recently  accompanied by episodes of unexplained sweating and fatigue.  In the mentioned case  Mr. S’s age  male gender  Caucasian race  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  diet  and the family history of coronary artery disease place him at a higher risk for this condition. His current clinical manifestations like anginal chest pain and exertional dyspnea are characteristics of worsening coronary artery disease. His hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes are significant contributing factors to his ongoing cardiac illness.
Coronary artery disease,10,43,Case Report  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 65-years-old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired mechanic  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  controlled by medication (lisinopril). He is a reformed smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history and quit 10 years ago. His father died from a myocardial infarction at 70. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus which he has attempted to manage through lifestyle changes  but still requires metformin. He is also susceptible to occasional bouts of anxiety and depression.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith made a routine visit to his primary care physician with complaints of intermittent chest pain that sometimes radiates down his left arm and occasionally to the jaw. He mentions it often occurs during physical activity and when he is under stress  but the pain subsides after he rests for a while. He also reported feeling short of breath during these episodes. Moreover  he mentions experiencing recent episodes of indigestion  fatigue  and excessive sweating  originally attributing them to ageing.  Considering his risk factors (age  sex  family history of heart disease  ex-smoker  hypertensive  diabetic)  as well as his symptoms (chest pain with radiation  dyspnea  episodes of indigestion  fatigue  sweating) it'd be appropriate to consider coronary artery disease in the differential diagnosis and proceed accordingly with investigations and management.   This case attempts to mirror literature which suggests that age  male gender  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  smoking  and a family history of heart disease are major risk factors for coronary artery disease.   The purpose of this case study is to educate medical students about the demographics  history  and common symptomatic presentation of coronary artery disease  and the importance of considering a person's risk factors when making a diagnosis or considering a differential. 
Coronary artery disease,10,44,"Subject: Training Case - Coronary Artery Disease  Case Report:  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Martin Davies Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residential Area: Urban  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Davies arrived at the clinic complaining of regular chest discomfort for the past three months. The pain  often described as """"pressure under the chest bone """" radiates to his left arm  is associated with sweating and occurs mainly after performing physical activities such as carrying grocery bags or climbing stairs. The discomfort usually subsides when he rests. Lately  it has become more frequent and severe.  Medical History: He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension for the past 10 years. Additionally  he is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 kg/m2. His father had a history of myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Mr. Davies used to smoke a pack a day for over 30 years before quitting five years ago.  Past Medications: He is on metformin for his diabetes and amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension control. The medications help to a certain extent but his blood glucose and blood pressure levels tend to fluctuate.  Physical Examination: Upon physical exam  Mr. Davies was observed to be mildly dyspneic. His blood pressure at the time was 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 82/minute  and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute.  The aim of the case study is to shed light on the associated risk factors of coronary artery disease  such as diabetes  hypertension  obesity  smoking  family history  and aging. The presentation focuses on the importance of early recognition and management of these contributing parameters to reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease. This case provides an excellent learning opportunity to understand the complex pathogenesis  clinical presentation  and pioneer investigations for diagnosis  along with learning about the appropriate strategies in managing this widespread condition.  Further discussions can focus on several aspects  including preventive cardiology  lifestyle modifications  and different therapeutic measures for coronary artery disease. Students should be encouraged to consider the socio-economic factors in managing such chronic diseases and the importance of patient education and cooperation in disease management."
Coronary artery disease,10,45,Case Title: Diagnosis and Management of Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Information: - Name: Mr. Peterson (hypothetical name to maintain patient confidentiality) - Age: 65 years  - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired factory worker - Marital Status: Married - Location: Urban  Chief Complaints: - Chest pain on exertion that improves with rest  ongoing for the last three months - Shortness of breath during moderate physical activity  - Occasional dizziness  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with Lisinopril  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  managed with Metformin - Former smoker  on nicotine patches  - Obese BMI of 32.1 kg/m2 - Family history of coronary artery disease  father died of myocardial infarction at age 70.  Physical Examination Findings: - Blood Pressure: 148/92 mm of Hg  - Pulse: 76 beats/minute  irregular - Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/minute - Body Temperature: 98.2 F  This case focuses on coronary artery disease (CAD)  one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. CAD typically affects older individuals  and men are often diagnosed at an earlier age than women. Furthermore  the patient's history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  along with his prior smoking habits  add significantly to his risk factor profile for CAD. The complaints  past medical history and current symptoms all point towards CAD  but definitive diagnostic testing should be done to confirm the illness and guide further treatment.  Note: The training case should then progress to discuss differential diagnosis  diagnostic testing (e.g.  EKG  stress tests  angiogram)  and ultimately  disease management  including lifestyle modifications and medication like antiplatelets  beta blockers or ACE inhibitors  statins  and possibly revascularization procedures (e.g.  angioplasty  bypass surgery). Throughout the case  remember to incorporate the principles of patient engagement  shared decision-making  cultural sensitivity  and medical ethics. 
Coronary artery disease,10,46,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Information:  Mr. James Smith  a 65-year-old African American male with a body mass index (BMI) of 30  presents by himself to the outpatient department.  Past Medical History:  He is known to have type II diabetes mellitus for the last ten years and hypertension for the past five years. Both conditions are usually well controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. He quit smoking 15 years ago but has a 20-pack yearly smoking history. He admits to modest alcohol intake and shows low physical activity in daily life. His father had a heart attack at the age of 60.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith has been experiencing a dull central chest pain that occasionally radiates to his left arm for the past two weeks. The discomfort lasts for 5-10 minutes and typically occurs when he is climbing stairs or carrying grocery bags  and subsides with rest. Recently  he's observed pain even during modest effort like walking to the nearby grocery store. He also reports dyspnea on exertion and occasional nocturnal dyspnea over the last week. He denies syncope  palpitations  lower limb swelling  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The students should focus on the symptom assessment  risk factors evaluation  and management guidelines for coronary artery disease.  (Note: Literature reflects patients with Black ethnicity are associated with a higher risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease compared to Caucasians  contributing to a higher rate of mortality. The risk is also higher among patients with a BMI >25 and type 2 diabetes as comorbid condition  similar to the given patient profile.)

He admits drinking alcohol occasionally.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years  which has been poorly controlled with the use of metformin. His fasting blood sugars often remain elevated around 150-170 mg/dl. He also has a history of hypertension  which remains uncontrolled despite the use of an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease including both of his parents  who had a heart attack in their late 60s. His lipid profile is abnormal with LDL of 150 mg/dl  HDL of 30 mg/dl  total cholesterol of 230 mg/dl  and triglycerides of 220 mg/dl.  Key Complaints: The patient visited the clinic due to a recent experience of chest discomfort that occurred several times during physical exertion  primarily while gardening or climbing stairs - but relieved with rest. The discomfort was described as 'pressure' behind the sternum and lasted for about 5-10 minutes each time. Accompanying symptoms were shortness of breath and a mild cold sweat. Over the last week  he has also reported occasional feelings of light-headedness.    Given that the patient’s demographics  medical history  and symptoms are typical representation for CAD as found in literature  this case is useful for teaching students about the disease burden  risk factors  classic symptoms  and preliminary diagnosis of CAD. 
Coronary artery disease,10,48,Patient Information:  Name: Mr. John Davis Age: 58 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Corporate Manager Residence: Urban environment  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Davis came to the clinic complaining of intermittent chest pain and discomfort  particularly after meals or exercise  lasting about 5-10 minutes  which resolves with rest. He also reported experiencing increased shortness of breath  fatigue  and palpitations on exertion in the past six months.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Davis has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been poorly controlled over the past five years due to inconsistent medication use and an unhealthy lifestyle. He has a known smoking history of 25 pack-years and frequently consumes alcohol. Additionally  he has a family history of premature cardiovascular disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at 62 years.  Physical examination:  He was slightly overweight with a BMI of 29. His blood pressure reading was slightly elevated at 148/90 mm Hg and heart rate was regular. A routine checkup revealed higher blood sugar levels along with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. No significant findings were noted on cardiovascular  respiratory  or other systemic examinations.  Based on the information obtained  the medical students will be challenged to discuss the possible diagnoses  explore risk factors  and suggest relevant investigations and management strategies in this case  considering coronary artery disease as the leading differential diagnosis.  Key Learning Objectives:  1. Understanding the common risk factors associated with coronary artery disease. 2. Identifying typical and atypical presentations of coronary artery disease. 3. Understanding principles of assessing a patient’s cardiovascular risk. 4. Client-centered education and counseling on lifestyle modification. 5. Formulating an appropriate investigation and management plan for potential coronary artery disease patients.
Coronary artery disease,10,49,"Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics: Mr. Robert Thompson  a 65-year-old African American male  retired engineer. He's married  has 5 children and resides in Atlanta  Georgia. His weight is 205 pounds and height is 5'9"""". He has a 35-year history of smoking  1 pack per day.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He has been on Metformin 1000mg twice daily  Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atorvastatin 40mg daily. His medical history also includes obesity (BMI 30.3) and a 20-year history of periodic alcohol use. He has no apparent allergy to any medications. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and later diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).  Key Complaints:  Mr. Thompson presents with complaints of """"chest pain"""" that he describes as """"pressure"""" in the center of his chest. The pain is occasionally radiating to his left shoulder and arm. He also reports mild shortness of breath  exacerbated on exertion. The chest discomfort commonly occurs while walking after a meal but is usually relieved by rest. He reports the frequency of these episodes has increased in the past couple of weeks.   Mr. Thompson also mentions he feels unusually fatigued recently  even with minimal physical activity. These symptoms have prompted him to seek immediate medical attention.  Comment:  This case scenario takes into account accurate demographic representation and risk factors for CAD as found in literature. African American individuals such as Mr. Thompson over the age of 45 are at an increased risk for CAD. Furthermore  his past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia  coupled with a strong family history of CAD  greatly predisposes him to the disease. His case also demonstrates typical symptoms of angina  grafting an opportunity to teach medical trainees on the clinical presentation and management of a potential cardiac patient. "
Coronary artery disease,10,50,Case Report:  Patient Information: John X  a 64-year-old African-American male  residing in an urban setting in New York City.  Past Medical History: John was diagnosed with Type-II Diabetes 14 years ago and Hypertension 10 years ago. He is former smoker  and has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32. Family background reveals his late father had similar coronary issues  passing away from a heart attack at 70. On a bi-yearly follow-up  he is regular with his medications  including Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for high blood pressure.  Presenting Complaints: Over the past month  he has been experiencing intermittent chest pains  describing it as a 'heavy  pressing sensation'. This discomfort also radiates to his left arm  intensified by moderate exertion like climbing stairs or carrying groceries. He frequently feels fatigued  and has been waking up at night because of shortness of breath. He reports a decreased exercise tolerance and increased episodes of unexplained upper abdominal pain.  Summary: The patient is a 64-year-old African-American male with a history of Type-II Diabetes  Hypertension  and Obesity. Family history is significant for CAD. He presents with classic symptoms of angina - chest pain and shortness of breath - which have been progressively worsening over the past month. Considering his age  race  past medical history  and current complaints  a deeper investigation to rule out Coronary Artery Disease is warranted. Tackling the issue responsibly will not only provide the patient a better prognosis but also contribute to curbing the over-representation of heart disease within the African-American demographic.   Note: This case aligns with the demographic representation as found in literature. Coronary Artery Disease is a significant health problem among older  African-Americans  heavily influenced by factors such as diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and obesity. In the African-American community  these conditions are often under-diagnosed and under-treated. As per CDC statistics  African-Americans  especially males  are at a higher risk for CAD  compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
Coronary artery disease,10,51,Case Summary:  Patient Identity: Mr. Edgar Smith  Age: 62 years  Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired teacher  Smoking History: Ex-smoker  quit 10 years ago  Alcohol Consumption: Social drinker  Patient History:   Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was a smoker for over 20 years but quit about 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol socially. There is a history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in his family; his father died of a heart attack in his late 50s.  Presenting Complaints:   During the last month  Mr. Smith has been experiencing intermittent chest discomfort typically during walking but recently occurred while he was sitting and watching TV. The discomfort begins in the center of the chest and feels like heavy pressure  lasting about 5-10 minutes. No radiation of the pain is reported. The discomfort is sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath and excessive sweating.   He initially attributed these symptoms to indigestion and stress but the increasing frequency and intensity worries him. His symptoms eased off with rest initially but lately  the episodes of chest discomfort have become more unpredictable. Notably  he has not experienced any symptoms suggestive of heart failure like orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or lower extremity edema.   Upon questioning  he admits to non-compliance with his medications and dietary recommendations. Mr. Smith also mentioned recent unintentional weight loss but denies any symptoms of fever  night sweats  or loss of appetite.  Review:  While the case above represents a Caucasian patient  it is vital to note that CAD affects all races and ethnicities. However  certain groups like African Americans  Native Americans  and South Asians  among others  may have higher prevalence rates owing to higher rates of risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and obesity. In designing medical education cases  representation and inclusivity of all patient demographics should be considered. 
Coronary artery disease,10,52,# Case Report - Coronary Artery Disease  ## Patient Demographics   Patient: Mr. Martinez Age: 65  Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired factory worker  ## Past Medical History   Mr. Martinez reports a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years  although he quit just a year ago after feeling shortness of breath whenever he walked a short distance. He also has the independence of managing his type 2 diabetes for about ten years  which is currently controlled with Metformin.   Mr. Martinez's father died of a heart attack at age 70  raising concerns about the patient's family history of cardiovascular disorders. The patient acknowledges a sedentary lifestyle and a diet that typically includes high-fat and high-sodium foods. He admits his weight has been gradually increasing over the past ten years and is currently overweight by BMI standards (BMI of 28).   ## Key Complaints   Mr. Martinez presented at the clinic reporting an increasing pattern of chest discomfort over the past couple of months. The discomfort is pressure-like  typically occurring in the mid-chest region and exacerbated by walking or emotional stress. It usually subsides with rest within ten minutes.   He denied symptoms of palpitations  syncope  or loss of consciousness but admitted feeling progressively fatigued over the last month. He also noted occasional shortness of breath with minimal exertion over the past few weeks  a slight swelling in his ankles  and rarely  nocturia.  ---  This case is structured based on scientific literature emphasizing that coronary artery disease is prevalent among males  especially older adults (≥ 45 years for men)  people with diabetes  individuals with a family history of heart disease  and smokers. The Hispanic population has been focused on because according to the CDC  Hispanic men are significantly likely to have heart disease.    The symptoms presented align with classic stable angina  often associated with coronary artery disease. The shortness of breath  fatigue  ankle swelling  and nocturia suggest possible concurrent mild heart failure.
Coronary artery disease,10,53,Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a background of low socioeconomic status. He is a retired factory worker  widowed  a smoker for over 40 years (20 sticks/day) with a calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28.9  suggesting he is overweight. The patient resides in a suburban setting and lives alone.  Past Medical History:  The patient's medical history reveals Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago  controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet. The patient also has a history of Hypertension for a decade  managed with antihypertensive medication. His medication list includes Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension  and he has been compliant with these medications. No known allergies are recorded.  The patient's father had suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. Our patient has no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) himself. His cholesterol levels have been occasionally elevated in the past but not treated. The patient's alcohol intake is moderate and his diet is rich in saturated fat.  Key Complaints:   The patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining of central chest pain radiating to his left arm for the past two hours. He describes it as a heaviness  particularly exacerbated whenever he tries to walk even short distances. He also reports associated shortness of breath  diaphoresis (sweating)  and nausea. He denies palpitations  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.   The patient is visibly anxious  and he fears that he might be having a heart attack because the pain is similar but more severe than previous episodes of discomfort he relates to heartburn. His symptoms did not show improvement with rest or over the counter antacid medications which he had at home.  This case is representative of many patients with coronary artery disease and is therefore suitable for teaching students about this condition. It provides a good learning opportunity regarding associated risk factors  history taking  clinical red flags  differential diagnoses  and interpretation of investigations. The case also highlights the importance of addressing the interconnected aspects of the patient's overall health  which includes his social circumstances  lifestyle choices  and chronic diseases.   This design account is important for accurate representation as coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death globally. It is also representative of the typical demographic known to be at high risk for heart disease: older age  male  lower socioeconomic status  smoker  diabetic  hypertensive  overweight  with a family history of cardiovascular disease  and following an unhealthy diet.

Coronary artery disease,10,56,"Title: Acute Chest Pain in Elderly Female with Known Risk Factors for Ischemic Heart Disease.  Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mrs. Esther Johnson  a 68-year-old African-American woman. She is a retired school teacher  living with her husband of 40 years. Based on U.S. survey data  African-Americans are especially susceptible to coronary artery disease (CAD).  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a 10-year history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She is a non-smoker; however  she has a family history of CAD (father died at age 62 from a myocardial infarction). She takes daily medications: hydrochlorothiazide  lisinopril  and metformin.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Johnson visits her family physician complaining of recent onset chest pain that she describes as """"pressure-like """" and radiates to her left arm and jaw. She reports the discomfort typically lasts for 15-20 minutes  most often following physical exertion or emotional stress  and is relieved with rest. She denied symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. However  she mentions she has been feeling unusually fatigued the past couple of weeks.   These symptoms may suggest angina pectoris due to advanced CAD – a chronic disease that can lead to acute complications like myocardial infarction  heart failure  and cardiac death. It's essential that medical students learn to recognize these key features and pursue a thorough diagnostic evaluation.  Educational Objectives: This case aims to teach students how to 1) recognize classic symptoms of CAD and understand its pathogenesis  2) articulate the significant risk factors for CAD  and 3) plan a diagnostic workup for suspected CAD in a high-risk individual."

Key Complaints: Mr. Hernandez mentions that he has been experiencing occasional chest discomfort for the past two months. He describes this pain as a pressure-like feeling in his chest that seems to radiate to his left arm. The discomfort is more prominent when he climbs stairs at work or when he’s stressed. The episodes last about 5-10 minutes and are relieved by rest. He also reported experiencing mild shortness of breath during these episodes.  This case scenario is representative of the demographic suffering from Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  considering the patient's age  ethnicity  and geographic location where CAD is prevalent. Risk factors present include hypertension  diabetes  family history of CAD  moderate alcohol consumption  and occasional smoking.+
Coronary artery disease,10,60,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 67-years-old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired   Chief Complaint: Recurrent chest pain for the past three months  especially during exercises  like walking up the stairs or carrying groceries.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes 8-years ago  which is under control with Metformin and Lisinopril. He also had a long history of tobacco use (40 pack-years). His LDL cholesterol levels have been slightly high over the past years. He's been following a diet plan and exercise regimen  prescribed by his primary care doctor  but adherence has been inconsistent.   Family History:  His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. His elder brother died from a stroke at the age of 73.  Living environment:  Mr. Smith lives with his wife in an urban environment. Since the death of his elder brother  his stress level has increased significantly.  Social habits:  He stopped smoking two years ago but still occasionally consumes alcohol.  Review of Systems: He reports shortness of breath when climbing stairs or walking up hills  but denies any nocturnal breathlessness or swelling in his legs. He also mentions occasional bouts of dizziness.  As stated in various literature  coronary artery disease (CAD) is generally common in older adults  especially in males. The major risk factors of CAD include hypertension  diabetes  smoking  hyperlipidemia  and a positive family history - all of which are present in Mr. Smith's case. This case can be employed as a typical representation of CAD in geriatric patients. Emphasis should be made on the identification and management of risk factors  thorough physical examination  correct interpretation of investigation findings  and appropriate management and follow-ups in such cases. The impacts of diet  exercise  and mental health  such as stress  on CAD should also be highlighted.
Coronary artery disease,10,61,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. James Smith is a 60-year-old African-American male from a low socioeconomic background  currently residing in the urban neighborhood of Detroit  Michigan. He is a retired autoworker who smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 35 years. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has a diet predominantly high in fat and salt.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both diagnosed 8 years ago and moderately controlled with oral medications. His father passed away at the age of 62 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His BMI is 31  indicating obesity. He complains of episodes of breathlessness while performing his daily activities  such as climbing stairs or even walking short distances  for the past 2 months.  Key Complaints: Smith visited the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain that started about an hour ago. He rates his pain as 8 out of 10 and describes it as a 'squeezing pain' located in the center of his chest  radiating to his left arm. He reported that he has experienced similar but less severe pains in the past that were somewhat relieved by rest. These pains typically occurred after walking his pet dog and were associated with cold sweats and fatigue  but he attributed them to his 'being out of shape'.  In this case  Mr. Smith's age  sex  ethnicity  socioeconomic status  lifestyle factors (smoking  diet)  medical history (hypertension  type 2 diabetes  obesity)  and family history of cardiac disease make him a high-risk candidate for coronary artery disease. His current symptoms strongly suggest a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction  which requires urgent medical attention. The delayed healthcare-seeking behavior is often seen in populations lacking in health awareness. Here the appropriate immediate and long-term management strategies would be lifesaving for Mr. Smith and play a crucial role in preventing further progression of the disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,62,"Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Garcia  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  currently residing in Miami  Florida. He is a retired school teacher and lives alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  which has been managed through oral medication along with lifestyle modifications. Proactive screening shows a history of hyperlipidemia from age 60  however  it is currently managed through statin therapy. He survived a mild stroke at 63 with no significant deficit and currently under antiplatelet therapy. He has not been diagnosed or treated for hypertension  though refers having """"borderline"""" high pressure during general health checks. Mr. Garcia was a heavy smoker (2 packs/day)  but quit 10 years ago after being diagnosed with COPD. There's no family history of cardiovascular disease. He has been maintaining a balanced diet and a moderate exercise routine  post-retirement.  Key Complaints: Mr. Garcia presents to the emergency department with a crushing chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and arm. It started about 1.5 hours ago while he was gardening and has been persistent since then. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath and profuse sweating. He denies any lightheadedness  nausea or vomiting. This is his first episode and he quickly self-associated it with heart trouble due to public health and wellness education.  Brief Summary: This patient case intends to familiarize medical students with typical presentation and risk factors of coronary artery disease while incorporating relevant comorbidities. Factors such as advanced age  male sex  Hispanic ethnicity  smoking history  type II diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and a prior stroke have made Mr. Garcia susceptible to the development of coronary artery disease. The patient's presentation with severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder  along with dyspnea and diaphoresis  is strongly indicative of an acute coronary syndrome  prompting the need for immediate diagnostic measures and treatment."
Coronary artery disease,10,63,Case Report:   Patient Demographics:   Sex: Male Age: 66 Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired police officer Presenting with wife Residence: Urban area  Past Medical History:   - Smoker for 25 years (2 packs/day)  quit ten years ago. - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  controlled with oral medication. - High cholesterol diagnosed five years ago. - Had hypertension for ten years  controlled with medication. - Father had an early heart attack (age 56). - Underwent benign prostate hypertrophy surgery three years ago.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a history of pressure-like central chest pain for the last 3 hours  radiating to his left arm  associated with fatigue  heavy sweating  and mild shortness of breath. The pain was not associated with exertion and did not subside with rest.  Registration clerk at the reception desk recognized the possible symptoms of a heart attack. The patient was immediately taken to a treatment room and was further evaluated by emergency room physicians.   In designing this case study  attention has been given to the demographic representation in terms of ethnicity  age  and sex most commonly correlated with positive diagnosis for coronary artery disease. It is more prevalent in men than women  particularly in those above 65 years. Risk factors like diabetes  high cholesterol  and hypertension are also considered based on their significant prevalence in the scientific literature. Additionally  this case takes into account that one in five men and women in America have a smoking history and that the disease can manifest as atypical like non-exertional chest pain  fatigue  and sweating.
Coronary artery disease,10,64,Case Report:  Subject: Mr. Ricardo Mendoza  Demographics: Mr. Mendoza is a 62-year-old Hispanic male currently residing in Miami  Florida. He is a retired school principal  originally from Mexico  and is a non-smoker. His BMI is 29.3  indicating he is overweight.  Past Medical History: He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed six years ago  which is managed with Metformin. He also has Hypertension  being treated with Losartan. He is also under treatment for Hyperlipidemia with Simvastatin. His family history is notable for his father who suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  Patient Complaints & Presentation: The patient presented to the clinic with new onset symptoms of chest pain over the last two weeks. He describes this pain as a heavy discomfort located centrally in his chest  often radiating to his left arm. This discomfort is typically brought on by physical exertion  such as walking fast or climbing stairs  and is relieved by rest. He also mentioned that the frequency of these episodes seems to be increasing. He denied experiencing dyspnea  palpitations  syncope  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Please note these are common symptoms associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Critical points to consider during this case study should include understanding the patient’s risk factors  recognizing the typical complaint and pursuing appropriate diagnostic testing  such as an ECG  cardiac stress test  or coronary angiography  necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis of CAD. Range of treatment options  including lifestyle modifications  pharmacotherapy and possible revascularization methods such as PCI or CABG should also be considered based on the progression of the disease.   Remember to place emphasis on communication  care and empathy towards the patient and their family  which is a fundamental principle of medical practice.
Coronary artery disease,10,65,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Maria Gonzalez  a 63-year-old Hispanic female  presented herself to the emergency department. She is a retired teacher who is married with three children. She resides in a suburban neighborhood.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Gonzalez has a medical history of hypertension diagnosed five years ago  for which she takes once-daily Lisinopril (10mg). She also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus over the past ten years managed with Metformin (500mg BID). She is non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. Patient's mother suffered from Coronary Artery Disease and had a myocardial infarction in her late 60s.  Key Complaints:  Over the past two days  Mrs. Gonzalez has been experiencing episodic  dull ‘squeezing’ chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain typically lasts for around 15 minutes and is particularly triggered by physical exertion such as climbing stairs or after having a meal. She reports that she has felt increasingly fatigued over the past week and has been experiencing disturbed sleep due to shortness of breath.   She has had mild to moderate episodes of pain prior to this  but it was never as severe. She initially dismissed it as indigestion but decided to seek medical attention when her medications for indigestion failed to relieve the symptoms. She also noticed that she now gets easily tired even on doing tasks which didn't exhaust her before.   She denies having any fever  cough  gastrointestinal or urinary complaints. However  she expressed significant concern relating to her heart disease risk given her familial background.  **Please note: Although this case reflects general demographic trends for Coronary Artery Disease  each patient should be considered unique and treated on their individual presentation.**
Coronary artery disease,10,66,Case Subject: Mr. George Martinez  Demographics: Mr. Martinez  a 62-year-old Hispanic male  residing in the Southeastern United States  is retired from a managerial position. He currently lives alone  smokes about a package of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years  and drinks alcohol socially. He admits to a diet high in saturated fats and carbohydrates with minimal physical activity. He also has a significant family history of coronary artery disease with both his father and paternal uncle having myocardial infarctions in their early 60s.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has a history of type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 50  which is poorly controlled (latest HbA1c is 9.2)  moderate hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. His medication history includes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. Mr. Martinez also has a short history of erectile dysfunction. He does not report any allergies.  Presenting complaints: For the last three weeks  Mr. Martinez has been experiencing episodes of discomfort localized in the central chest area. The discomfort is dull in nature  comes on with exertion (primarily while climbing stairs)  and is relieved with rest in about 10 minutes. More recently  he has noted that the discomfort starts even with less exertion  such as walking short distances.  He denies experiencing this discomfort at rest  in cold weather  or during moments of stress or emotion. The discomfort does not radiate and is not associated with dyspnea  nausea  or sweating. Over the last few days  he has begun to experience it more frequently.  Objective Data to be collected: Objective data collections should focus on physical examination findings such as blood pressure  heart rate  signs of heart failure  or other related illnesses. It should also include relevant lab findings including blood lipids levels  blood glucose levels  ECG  stress test  etc.  Brief Summary: Mr. Martinez  a 62-year-old Hispanic male with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  presents with exertional chest discomfort consistent with the typical angina pattern. Given his risk factors and symptoms  coronary artery disease should be high on the differential diagnosis. The objective data collection will assist in confirming or discarding this diagnosis and guide the subsequent management pathway.

Coronary artery disease,10,68,"Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Robert Hastings  a 62-year-old Caucasian male occupies an upper middle-class economic status. Mr. Hastings is an executive at a corporate firm which involves high levels of stress and sedentary work activities. He has been a smoker for 40 years and has reduced his physical activity over the past 10 years. He currently consumes a diet high in saturated fats.  Past Medical History: Mr. Hastings has a significant past medical history including: 1. Hypertension (diagnosed at 45 yo) 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed at 55 yo) 3. High cholesterol levels (diagnosed at 50 yo) 4. Family history of cardiovascular diseases (Father died at 65 yo due to myocardial infarction).  Key complaints: - Over the past three months  Mr. Hastings has episodically experienced a sensation of heavy pressure in the mid-chest region  described as being """"squeezed in a vise."""" - The pain often radiates to his left shoulder and arm. - These episodes are most frequently triggered by stress or physical exertion and typically last for about 10-15 minutes. - Rest or nitroglycerin  prescribed for his angina  seems to relieve this pain. - In the past week  he has noticed this pain persisting at rest  and episodes have increased in both severity and frequency.  This real-world case centers on a representative patient based on the demographics of those most commonly affected by coronary artery disease  as found in the literature. Numerous risk factors are notably present in Mr. Hastings' history  including advanced age  male gender  hypertension  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  poor diet  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  stressful professional background  and family history of cardiovascular disease. As such  this case encourages medical students to consider the multifactorial nature of coronary artery disease and its strong tie to modifiable lifestyle factors.  Moreover  the recent change in frequency  duration  severity  or ease of provocation of angina episodes displayed in Mr. Hastings case could represent a transition from stable angina to unstable angina  potentially signaling the onset of acute coronary syndrome.

Coronary artery disease,10,69,"Case Report:  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old African American male named Mr. Jones. He is a retired mechanical engineer  married with three adult children  and a resident of a suburban community. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol use.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a notable past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These conditions are reasonably well-controlled with medication  and regular follow-up with his primary care physician. He maintains a stable weight but has a poor dietary habit  primarily eating red meats  fried food  and processed food with low fiber and low fruits/vegetables. He also has a sedentary lifestyle with little physical exercise.  Family History:  He has a family history of premature coronary artery disease  with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. His mother suffered from hypertension and diabetes mellitus similar to him but is alive and well at the age of 80.  Key Complaints:  Over the past couple of weeks  Mr. Jones has been experiencing intermittent chest discomfort on moderate exertion  such as climbing two flights of stairs  but the discomfort subsides at rest. The discomfort is described as a central squeezing sensation  sometimes radiating to his left arm which lasts approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Abnormalities are noted as fatigue  occasional shortness of breath  and lightheadedness.  Note: He has not sought any medical advice regarding the above symptoms prior to this visit  attributing the pain to """"just getting old"""" and stress. However  he now presents to the emergency department due to the increasing frequency and intensity of the chest discomfort and a general feeling of unwell. There were no associated symptoms of syncope  palpitations  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or lower extremity edema.  Based on this  a working diagnosis of stable angina due to suspected coronary artery disease is made. The contributing factors appear to be a mixture of genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of regular exercise."
Coronary artery disease,10,70,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Details: Maria  a 65-year-old Hispanic female.  Past Medical History: Maria has a history of hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  and type-2 diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years. She is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol use. She leads a sedentary lifestyle and is classified as obese with a BMI of 32. Her family history reveals that her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67.  Chief Complaints: Maria reports progressively worsening chest discomfort over the past six months. She describes the pain as heavy and squeezing  typically lasting for several minutes and more frequently presenting during times of stress or physical labor. She has also been experiencing episodes of unexplained fatigue and breathlessness upon exertion.   Discussion Guide: This case is representative as coronary artery disease (CAD) is more prevalent in females over the age of 60  particularly in those of Hispanic heritage. The patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history all contribute to an increased risk of CAD. Her symptoms of exertional chest discomfort  fatigue  and breathlessness are classic presentations for angina pectoris which may indicate underlying CAD. According to literature  women with CAD experience more non-traditional symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath in comparison to men.  The discussion should drive students to consider the risk factors  presentation  and investigations necessary for diagnosing CAD  including physical examination  ECG  stress testing  and possibly coronary angiography. This case encourages reflection upon lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions that could be recommended to this patient to manage her condition and risk factors  including hypertension and diabetes.  Moreover  it is an opportune time to discuss disparities in healthcare  as studies have revealed Hispanic communities have higher rates of obesity and diabetes  both primary risk factors for CAD  and may suffer from decreased access to healthcare. They may also experience language barriers  which could impair patient-physician communication and hinder the delivery of optimal care.
Coronary artery disease,10,71,Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Demographics Patient: Mr. Richard Wilson Age: 58 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Structural engineer Lifestyle: Sedentary  with a history of heavy tobacco smoking and moderate alcohol consumption  Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has had a diagnosis of hypertension for the past 10 years controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). He also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin HCL 500mg twice daily and has a history of high cholesterol for which he has been taking Atorvastatin 40mg at bedtime. He had a few close family members who died unexpectedly of heart disease below the age of 60.  Key Complaints:  For the past few months  Mr. Richardson has been experiencing episodes of chest discomfort and shortness of breath during exertion  typically while climbing stairs or performing heavy construction-related work. He has described the pain as a central  pressure-like discomfort in the chest  which usually resolves upon rest. Recently  however  these episodes have begun to occur with lesser activities and sometimes at rest  interfering with his daily life. Last night  he woke up from sleep due to severe chest pain that radiated down his left arm. The pain lasted about 15 minutes and  though it resolved on its own  it left him feeling weak and sweaty.  Please note: Despite the above-mentioned findings  CAD can affect anyone regardless of age  gender  or ethnicity. However  some factors such as older age  male gender  ethnicity like African American  and having family history of heart disease can increase the risk of developing CAD.  The instructor can then guide the students in interpreting the patient's clinical picture and defining the next steps in management. The teaching focus should be on learning about the risk factors and typical symptoms of coronary artery disease  its diagnosis process  including ECG  blood tests  and coronary angiography  as well as management strategies like lifestyle changes  medications  and possible interventions (angioplasty/stent placement  bypass surgery).
Coronary artery disease,10,72,Patient Information:  Name: Mr. John Walcott  Age: 52 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Office worker  leading a sedentary lifestyle Smoking Status: Former smoker (20 years  quit 5 years ago) Alcohol Use: Moderate (social drinker) Family History: Positive for coronary artery disease (Father died suddenly at age 58  one older brother underwent coronary angioplasty at age 50)  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension (diagnosed 7 years ago  under medication) 2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 3 years ago  under medication) 3. Hyperlipidemia (diagnosed 4 years ago  under medication)  Key Complaints:  Mr. Walcott visited the clinic complaining of atypical chest pain that he describes as a 'heavy' and 'tight' sensation. The pain started 2 weeks ago. Initially  it occurred intermittently  especially during physical exertion  but has since been increasing in frequency. The pain sometimes radiates to the left arm and is also associated with shortness of breath  excessive sweating  and light-headedness. He has also noted the feeling of fatigue even at rest  unexplained weight gain  and swelling of feet  especially noticed at the end of the day.  Mr. Walcott's case highlights some of the typical features and risk factors associated with coronary artery disease  such as age  male gender  African American ethnicity  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and strong family history of CAD. Furthermore  the presence of comorbid conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia significantly accelerates the likelihood of coronary artery disease. The symptoms he presents with point towards angina – probably a sign of significant coronary artery occlusion. It's also important to note the risk of silent ischemia due to his history of diabetes. The symptoms of fatigue  unexplained weight gain  and swelling of feet might indicate possible heart failure  a complication of unchecked CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,73,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. Juan Almeida  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  resides in New York City with his wife. He is a retired construction manager  a non-smoker but used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day for around 20 years before he quit 10 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol. There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 70.  Past Medical History:  Over the last 5 years  Mr. Almeida has been managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He has been compliant with Metformin 1 gm twice daily and Losartan 50 mg once daily. His most recent Hemoglobin A1c level was measured at 7.2% three months ago  and more recent blood pressure readings have consistently been around 135/85 mmHg. He also frequently suffers from indigestion and has a history of peptic ulcers. His BMI classifies him as overweight (BMI=28).  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Almeida has recently been experiencing episodes of central chest pain radiating to his left arm  especially while walking up stairs or other exertion. The pain is often relieved by rest. These episodes have become increasingly frequent over the past week.   Recent records show slightly elevated cholesterol and LDL levels  with reduced HDL levels.  This case highlights significant clinical risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease including age  gender  ethnicity  family history  physical inactivity  hypertension  history of smoking  diabetes  dyslipidemia and being overweight. The characterizing chest pain is typical of angina pectoris  an important symptom suggesting Coronary Artery Disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,74,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Lopez Age: 63 years old  Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupational History: Retired truck driver.  Demographics: The patient resides in a large metropolitan area known for its multicultural demographics. He is married with two adult children. His socioeconomic status is a low-income bracket.  Past Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 15 years ago  and hypertension 10 years ago  managing both conditions with medication and lifestyle adaptations. His one noteworthy surgery was a hernia operation 5 years ago. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 50  indicating a family history of coronary heart disease. His mother has hypertension and diabetes. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 25 years but quit 15 years ago. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in fats and carbohydrates.  Key Complaint/Reason for Visit: Mr. Lopez presented to the clinic feeling consistent chest discomfort described as 'pressure-like'  especially when performing physical tasks such as mowing the lawn or climbing stairs. These bouts of discomfort usually last approximately 10 minutes and are typically relieved by rest. He also reported shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion  which have progressively worsened over the last two months. He has not experienced a loss of consciousness  nausea  vomiting  or sweating during these episodes. He has also denied any abnormalities in bowel movements or urination. These symptoms have caused him to stop much of his physical activity  increasing his concern. He denies having ever experienced any similar episodes in the past.  Current Medication: Metformin 1000mg/bid for diabetes  Lisinopril 20mg/once daily for hypertension.  This case represents the demographic group (elderly Hispanic male) known to bear a disproportionately high burden of coronary artery disease owing to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. This patient’s history of diabetes and hypertension  combined with a family history of early heart disease  and personal history of smoking and ineffective diet serves to increase his risk. With these considerations  potential diagnosis of coronary artery disease is of concern.-degree angle to the long axis of the body and slightly to the left.   End of Case Report.
Coronary artery disease,10,75,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. John Rivera Sex: Male Age: 62 years  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Bank Manager Insurance Status: Medicare Smoker: Yes (40 pack year history) Alcohol Use: Moderate Body Mass Index (BMI): 28  Past Medical History:   1) Hypertension managed with Lisinopril 2) Type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin 3) Hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin 4) Family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD)- father and paternal uncle both had their first myocardial infarction at ages 55 and 59 respectively.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Rivera presents to the clinic with intermittent  constrictive discomfort in the center of his chest which often radiates towards his left arm. Episodes last for 5-10 minutes at a time and have been happening for the past 2 months. They are often induced by exercise and alleviate by rest. He also reports experiencing dyspnea on exertion and has noticed a decrease in exercise tolerance within the past couple of months. These symptoms have worried Mr. Rivera as he knows his father and uncle both had heart disease. He denies other symptoms such as syncope  palpitations  or orthopnea.  Assessment of this case should focus on advanced cardiovascular examination and diagnostic tests for coronary artery disease including ECG  stress test  echocardiography  and angiogram. Students should be instructed to focus on assessment  risk stratification  patient counseling  and treatment considerations for CAD including medical  invasive  and lifestyle modification strategies. They should also be advised to educate patients about the importance of timely evaluation of potential angina symptoms.  Note: This patient's history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia should be highlighted  as these are major risk factors for developing coronary artery disease which proves its epidemiological setting. Other factors including age  gender  race  and positive family history should also be discussed in the context of risk stratification.
Coronary artery disease,10,76,Patient Profile: - Age: 55 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Office worker - Smoking Status: Former smoker; 1 pack per day for 25 years  quit 10 years ago - Alcohol Use: Rarely - Family history: Father had hypertension  mother had type II diabetes  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 10 years  controlled with medication - Type II diabetes for 5 years  diet-controlled - Occasional dyslipidemia  Chief Complaints: 1. Progressive chest discomfort over the past 4 months: The patient describes a dull central chest discomfort radiating to the left arm  usually during exertion (climbing stairs  exercising)  lasting 5-10 minutes  and subsiding with rest. Severity of pain has been increasing from 3/10 (4 months ago) to 6/10 (present). It is occasionally associated with shortness of breath. 2. Shortness of breath on exertion: The patient reported increasing difficulty in breathing on performing daily activities like walking or climbing stairs and has had to reduce his physical activity due to this. No associated cough  wheezing  or chest pain. No orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 3. Fatigue: The patient reported feeling unusually tired  especially over the past month.  Angina symptoms - chest discomfort with exertion and associated shortness of breath and fatigue suggest an underlying coronary artery disease. His old age  gender  race  history of hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  and smoking status further accentuate his risk. Hence  a coronary artery disease should be kept in differential diagnosis  and further diagnostic evaluations  including diagnostic stress testing or perhaps invasive coronary angiography  should be planned.

He is a retired military officer  lives with his wife of 40 years  and they have four children. He has a past history of smoking for 10 years but quit 30 years ago. His height is about 5 foot 9 inches  and he weighs 200 pounds. He lives in the urban area of Boston  Massachusetts and comes from a middle-income background.   Past Medical History: Robert has a relevant medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and controlled medications. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia which was diagnosed 6 years ago and is under control with statin therapy. There is no reported history of diabetes  and Robert regularly monitors his blood sugar after his meals given an unreliable family history of DM. His father died in his early 70s due to a heart attack  and his mother is living and has a history of ischemic heart disease.   Key Complaints: The patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining of intermittent chest pain that has been ongoing for the last couple of weeks. The pain is usually in the central part of his chest and sometimes radiates to the left side of his jaw. It often comes after exertion  like walking a distance  and relieves upon resting. He rate it as 7/10 in severity. Pain is described as squeezing or like """"chest being in a vice.""""  In the last two days  he also noticed that the pain often wakes him up from sleep and does not go away even after resting. Robert also mentions feeling extremely fatigued lately compared to his usual state. Occasionally  he also experiences profuse sweating  despite daily temperatures being in the normal range.   Concluding Remarks:  This case report can form the basis for understanding and diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Robert's history  demographics  and symptoms can be analyzed to consider possible medical diagnoses  engage in differential diagnoses as well as plan investigations. His notable risk factors include age  gender  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  ex-smoker status  family history  and symptoms that match the profile for CAD."
Coronary artery disease,10,78,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Rodriguez  Age: 59 years Gender: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Truck driver Smoking Status: Smoker (30 packs/year) Alcohol Consumption: Moderate  BMI: 30 (Obese) Family History: Father suffered from coronary heart disease  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago for which he is on metformin. He was diagnosed with hypertension 7 years ago for which he takes amlodipine. He also suffers from dyslipidemia  currently managed on statin therapy. He has a history of smoking for the past 20 years.    Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez visits the clinic complaining of recurring chest discomfort that he describes as a heavy feeling rather than a sharp pain  particularly when doing physical activities  which eases upon rest. He also reports shortness of breath  tiredness  and occasional feelings of dizziness. He has also noticed that his episodes of chest discomfort have recently been triggered by lesser levels of exertion than before.   Based on the aforementioned profile  the patient is presenting with stable angina due to coronary artery disease  a clinical diagnosis that should be confirmed with appropriate investigations. Cardiovascular risk factors in this case include the patient's age  gender  heredity  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  obesity  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  and possibly stress given his profession.                                   
Coronary artery disease,10,79,Case Report:  Demographics - Patient: Mr. Samuel Peterson Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer Smoking History: Ex-smoker; stopped 7 years ago.  Past Medical History - 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 2. Hypertension 3. Dyslipidemia  Key Complaint - Mr. Peterson presented to the clinic with a 6-week history of experiencing tightness in the chest  particularly during his morning walks. The chest discomfort typically lasts 10-15 minutes and usually resolves with rest. He complained that over the last week  the chest pain has started to occur more frequently  at times even while at rest. He has noticed that his exercise tolerance has decreased. He also reported occasional shortness of breath  particularly while climbing stairs  but does not wake him during sleep. He denied any palpitation  dizziness  syncope  orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No prior history of heart disease. He maintains a rather sedentary lifestyle and his diet is high in sodium and saturated fats. His BMI falls into the overweight range. He has a history of 35 years of smoking  but quit 7 years ago.  This case is designed to be indicative of stable angina progressing into unstable angina  which are common presentations in Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The contributing risk factors are senior age  male gender  history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  and an unhealthy diet. These are all widely associated with CAD in medical literature.  Note: Adjust demographic characteristics accordingly to reflect the patient population in your geographic location or intended scope of practice.
Coronary artery disease,10,80,"Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics: Name: John Doe Age: 52 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Construction laborer Smoking status: Smoked 1 pack/day for 30 years  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (controlled with metformin). 2. Hypertension (controlled with lisinopril). 3. Obesity with Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31. 4. Family history of heart disease (father and elder brother died of heart attacks in their mid-fifties).  Chief Complaints: Patient presents to the clinic complaining of episodes of chest discomfort over the past six weeks  particularly during physical work or walking. He describes the discomfort as a heavy pressure-like sensation  located """"right in the middle of the chest"""". The episodes generally resolve with rest within about 10 minutes. The pain does not radiate and is not associated with shortness of breath  nausea or diaphoresis (sweating).  Of note  he states that these episodes are becoming more frequent  and he had one today  which prompted him to seek medical attention. The episode today was similar to previous ones but felt more intense and lasted for about 20 minutes  causing him concern. He denies experiencing any dizziness  palpitations  or loss of consciousness.  The Case:  To provide a better understanding of the case  students will have to start with recognizing that the patient's history is highly suggestive of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease (CAD). They are requested to outline the associated risk factors from the patient’s history and discuss the significant management strategies  which is basement of the diagnosis suspected. The case is designed in such a way as to prompt the need for urgency and aggressiveness in the management of CAD  given the patient's increasing frequency and intensity of chest pain. This situation could suggest underlying worsening CAD or potentially unstable angina  which can lead to myocardial infarction or heart attack if not addressed urgently."
Coronary artery disease,10,81,Case Report   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. Lorenzo Garcia. He is a retired postman  lives with his wife  and has 3 grown-up children. His primary language is Spanish but he also speaks fluent English. He is a long-term smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history and is overweight with a BMI of 28. He lives in an urban population area and has a fixed income with adequate Medicare insurance. He has an average level of education  having finished high school.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has a medical history of hypertension (HTN)  which was diagnosed 10 years ago and is well-controlled with Lisinopril. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM type 2) and is on Metformin with inadequate glycemic control. He also has Hyperlipidemia  for which he is prescribed statin therapy. His father had an early myocardial infarction (died at age 56). We could not find any family history of stroke or other peripheral vascular disease.  Key Complaints: Mr. Garcia seeks medical attention due to a two-month history of episodic chest pain. The pain typically arises on brisk walking and is relieved after a few minutes of rest. For the last two weeks  however  he admits that it has been occurring more frequently  especially during minimal activities such as climbing stairs  and sometimes at rest. He describes it as a pressing  substernal pain that sometimes radiates to his left shoulder but never to his jaw or arm. At times  he experiences a few moments of breathlessness with the chest pain. He also reports of feeling increasingly fatigued over the last few weeks. There’s no history of associated diaphoresis  palpitations  syncope  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies experiencing any fevers  coughs  swollen legs  or significant weight changes. He also denies any change in his diet or daily activities that might explain his symptoms.  This case is representative of the accurate demographic disposition of coronary artery disease  especially considering the prevalence among Hispanic males  the patient's age  significant family history  and the effect of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and smoking habit.
Coronary artery disease,10,82,CASE REPORT:  Patient Credentials: - Name: John Doe (Pseudonym used to maintain patient confidentiality) - Age: 68 years - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired Bank Manager - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has been a type II diabetic for the past 20 years with fair glycemic control. He has been hypertensive for the past 15 years for which he takes antihypertensives regularly. He was a heavy smoker until five years ago  when he quit. He also has a familial history of cardiovascular disease – his father suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with a primary complaint of severe chest pain since last evening. He explains the pain as heaviness in his chest and the pain radially spreads to his left arm and jaw. Along with that  he reported episodes of breathlessness on minimal exertion and episodes of unexplained fatigue over the past month. He also mentioned experiencing palpitations and occasional lapses into lightheadedness.  Given the high prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in African American males in their late 60s and based on the symptomatic correlation  students are advised to consider a differential diagnosis of CAD. Further evaluations and management strategies should be discussed and decided within the scope of this clinical impression.
Coronary artery disease,10,83,"CASE REPORT:  Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez is a 67-year-old Hispanic male retired from manual labor  who currently resides in Albuquerque  New Mexico with his wife.   Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has had borderline hypertension for the last 10 years  controlled with lifestyle modifications along with occasional use of anti-hypertensive medication  namely amlodipine. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 3 years ago but rarely follows the diet or medication regimen prescribed; his HbA1c levels consistently indicate poor glycaemic control. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history  but reports having quit smoking about 10 years ago. He is overweight with a BMI of 29.5 kg/m2  and has a family history of premature heart disease  with his father dying of myocardial infarction at age of 56. Lastly  he admits to drinking alcohol socially.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez consults at the outpatient department complaining of sudden-onset burning chest pain in the central part of his chest  lasting for over an hour. He describes the pain as """"like a pressure or tightness """" radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath  sweating  and light-headedness. The pain was initially eased by rest when it occurred several weeks ago; however  it has started to become severe and happen even while resting in the past week.  Consideration: Given the patient’s age  sex  race/ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  family history of premature heart disease  and former smoking habits  he is at a high risk for coronary artery disease. The chief complaints  especially worsening chest pain triggered by minimal or no physical activity and prolonged chest pain at rest  may suggest unstable angina or an ongoing heart attack.  This case well represents an example of coronary artery disease in older  Hispanic males  which is consistent with published literature reporting a higher incidence of heart disease in this demographic. Moreover  poor control of risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and obesity  along with lifestyle and genetic factors  can worsen the progression of coronary artery disease. This case underlines the necessity of primary and secondary prevention interventions in such high-risk groups."
Coronary artery disease,10,84,Case Report:   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 62-year-old African American male  retired and living with his wife of 40 years. He has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes every day for the past 25 years  though quit ten years ago. He engages in minimal physical exercise and admits his diet could be better  often choosing fast-food meals due to their convenience. He is of moderate socioeconomic status and lives in an urban setting.   Past Medical History:  He has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both well-controlled with medication (Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension). Five years ago  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol and has been on Atorvastatin since then. There is a family history of heart disease; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. His last physical examination was a year ago  where he was noted to be obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2.   Key Complaints: He has recently started experiencing intermittent chest tightness and shortness of breath that typically occur after eating or exerting himself physically. These episodes last for about 5-10 minutes then resolve by themselves  but they are increasing in both frequency and intensity. He has also noticed that he has been more fatigued than usual over the past couple of weeks.  This case acknowledges the elevated risk of coronary artery disease in African American men  particularly those with a history of hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of heart disease. The symptoms point towards angina  an indicator of coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,85,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  residing in an urban area. He is married with 3 kids and 6 grandchildren. Mr. Rodriguez is a non-smoker  but reports a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has a history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  which are both controlled with medication (metformin and lisinopril  respectively). He also has a family history of heart disease  with his father having had a heart attack in his late 50s. His BMI indicates obesity and he admits infrequent exercise. His diet is rich in saturated fats and he shows initial signs of high cholesterol.  Key Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez comes in for a routine appointment  during which he reports intermittent episodes of chest discomfort over the past two months. The discomfort is described as a tight feeling located in the center of the chest  which sometimes trends towards the left side. These episodes typically last for about 10-15 minutes and often occur after moderate physical exertion such as playing with his grandchildren or doing yard work. He initially attributed the discomfort to indigestion  but recently  lighter activities such as casual walking seem to trigger these episodes  which is now causing him concern. He also reports occasional episodes of breathlessness.   This case is designed to simulate a real-life presentation of coronary artery disease with typical risk factors such as advanced age  male gender  ethnicity  diabetes  hypertension  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and unhealthy diet. Moreover  it takes into account the higher prevalence of coronary artery disease among Hispanics  related to factors such as diabetes and obesity. This case aims to teach medical students to understand  diagnose  and manage coronary artery disease  taking into account cultural  social  and lifestyle factors.
Coronary artery disease,10,86,Case Study: Mr. Johnson  Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics: Name: Samuel Johnson Age: 63 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  ex-smoker for over 10 years after a 30 year smoking history Demographics Justification: The choice of a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient aligns with the current epidemiological data  which identifies middle-aged to elderly men as a high-risk group for coronary artery disease (CAD). Also  rates of CAD are higher in smokers  even those who quit smoking.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for over 8 years (on medication) 2. Type II Diabetes mellitus for around 5 years (on oral hypoglycemic agents) 3. High cholesterol levels (on statins) 4. Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago) 5. Family history of heart disease (Father died at 67 from myocardial infarction) History Justification: The patient's medical history demonstrates the association between CAD and common risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and genetic predisposition.  Key Complaints: 1. Reported an increasing intensity of chest pain over the past 2 months  more noticeable during physical activities like walking his dog or climbing stairs. 2. The pain  typically in the center of his chest  often radiates to his left shoulder and arm. 3. He often feels breathless with the onset of the chest pain. 4. He's also observed that he tires more quickly than usual in recent weeks. Complaints Justification: Chest pain or discomfort that worsens with physical activity and resolves with rest is typical of angina pectoris – a key symptom of CAD. The fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath) reported by the patient are also common symptoms associated with CAD.   In Conclusion: This scenario creates an inclusive environment for the discussion of key concepts in CAD  such as the relationship between risk factors and disease  the significance of patient medical history and patient symptoms in CAD diagnosis. The primary goal of this case study is to boost the medical student's clinical reasoning skills and their understanding of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,87,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. John Rodriguez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  a retired factory worker  comes to the office for a routine check-up. He is a resident of Los Angeles  grandmother and grandfather both immigrated from Mexico. Married with 3 kids and 5 grandchildren.   Past Medical History: Mr. John has a history of hypertension (HTN) with sub-optimal control on hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ)  diagnosed seven years back. He also has controlled type II diabetes mellitus (DM) managed on metformin for five years. His lipid profile from last year shows mild hyperlipidemia. For the last 15 years  he's been a consistent smoker  smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. His diet is mainly fast food  and admits to having a 'sweet tooth'  often eating sugar-rich foods. He does a 30-minute walk twice a week  but no other physical activities. Family history is remarkable for his father suffering from a myocardial infarction (MI) at the age of 64.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez reports he has been experiencing exertional chest discomfort for the past two months. He describes it as a 'feeling of heaviness' located in the center of his chest. It typically lasts less than 10 minutes and is relieved by taking rest. Last week  he experienced this discomfort after a large meal  which is a new occurrence. He denies taking any over-the-counter medication for this. He also notes increased shortness of breath and fatigue while climbing stairs. No history of syncope  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Coronary artery disease,10,88,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 62 years - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Firefighter - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for 10 years  controlled with medication - Smoker for 30 years  quit 6 years ago - Occasional alcohol drinker - Family history of coronary artery disease in paternal lineage (Father died of myocardial infarction at age 70)  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department complaining of intermittent chest discomfort over the past six weeks. Recently  he has noticed an increase in the severity and frequency of these episodes  stating they often occur while he's engaged in yard work or climbing stairs. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest  occasionally radiating to his left arm. Rest and cessation of activity typically relieve the discomfort within a few minutes.  Additional Complaints:  Over the same period  he has also experienced shortness of breath with increased exertion  mild episodes of restlessness  an unusual feeling of fatigue  and infrequent bouts of nausea and cold sweats. There was no history of palpitations  syncope  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denied cough  fever  or weight changes.   This hypothetical case presents a high-risk profile for coronary artery disease (CAD) which is common in males over the age of 60  especially those with a history of long-term smoking  hypertension  and family history of CAD. The study of CAD prevalence in these demographics is well documented in medical literature  making this an accurate representation for the students to study.
Coronary artery disease,10,89,Patient Case Report:  Demographics: Patient: Mr. Allen Smith Age: 63 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired from a managerial position Residence: Urban Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with hypertension two years ago and was prescribed a daily medication regimen. He had a smoking history of 1 pack/day for 35 years and quit 10 years ago. He has a known family history of heart disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. There is no history of diabetes.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith arrived at the outpatient clinic reporting increased fatigue over the past several weeks. He mentions discomfort and tightness in his chest during his daily morning walks in the last two weeks. The chest discomfort  which he describes as heavy and squeezing sensation  tends to subside after 10-15 minutes of rest. He has also noticed mild episodes of shortness of breath accompanying the chest discomfort.  For the past three days  he has been experiencing similar bouts of chest discomfort while doing minor activities around the house or even while sitting stressfully watching news on TV. He has also noticed an increase in frequency and severity of this discomfort and a decrease in its predictability and the exercise amount causing it. He denied any instances of syncope  palpitation  or lower limb swelling. His appetite and weight have remained stable  and he has not noticed any changes in his bowel movements or urine habits.  Note: This case report is designed based on the fact that coronary artery disease (CAD) predominantly affects men over 55 years of age and is particularly prevalent in the Caucasian population. A significant risk factor for CAD is hypertension  along with a history of smoking and a family history of heart disease. The symptoms described by Allen Figuratively are consistent with chronic stable angina transitioning to unstable angina  a common presentation of CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,90,Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  64-year-old African American male  Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought to the emergency after experiencing sharp chest pain radiating to his left arm  along with shortness of breath  and cold sweats which started while he was climbing stairs at his home.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been suffering from hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. He has been on oral hypoglycemic drugs and antihypertensive treatment. He has a history of smoking – approximately one pack per day for the last 30 years  but he quit smoking a year ago. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65  indicating a positive family history of coronary artery disease. Mr. Smith admits to not have been too compliant with his medications and has a relatively sedentary lifestyle with an unhealthy diet consisting mainly of processed and high-fat foods.  Lifestyle and Personal Details: Mr. Smith is a retired high school teacher  is widowed  and lives with his son. His alcohol consumption is limited to social occasions.  Key details from initial examination: On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His BP was noted to be 170/100 mmHg  pulse - 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate - 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation - 94% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 30 kg/m2  indicating that the patient is classified as obese.   On auscultation  no heart murmurs or abnormal lung sounds were heard. His electrocardiogram showed Q wave and ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  and aVF  consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction.  Given his high-risk profile (age  gender  race  history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  unhealthy diet  non-compliance to medications  and family history)  the students should be guided to understand the cumulative impact of these factors on Mr. Smith's cardiovascular health leading to the presenting symptoms of coronary artery disease. This case should serve as an exemplar for coronary artery disease for educating the students on its risk factors  clinical presentation  and immediate management. 
Coronary artery disease,10,91,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Demographics:  Name: John Doe Age: 59 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Police Officer Marital Status: Married  Domicile: Urban area  Past Medical History:  John has a known history of hypertension for 10 years  hyperlipidemia for 7 years  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 4 years. His father had a heart attack at the age of 62. John has been a smoker for 35 years and has a sedentary lifestyle. His medications include Metformin 500 mg BD for diabetes  Atorvastatin 40 mg OD for hyperlipidemia  and Lisinopril 10 mg OD for hypertension. John has poor medication adherence.  Key complaints:  John came to the emergency room complaining of central chest pain radiating to the left arm  worsening over the last 3 hours with associated shortness of breath  nausea  and profuse sweating. He states that the pain feels like a heavy weight is placed on the chest and it does not alleviate with rest.  As this case represents  men  especially those with familial history of heart disease  have a greater propensity towards coronary artery disease. Increased prevalence of the disease can also be observed in people with sedentary lifestyles  smokers  individuals with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. Even though coronary artery disease can affect individuals of all races and ethnicities  Caucasian men have been reportedly more prone to it as compared to their racial counterparts. Older age and urban lifestyle due to changes in physical activity and diet also increase the risk. Thus  John's case fairly represents common demographic and risk factors seen in literature.   In your further education lessons  you may want to elaborate on the detailed assessment  investigations  diagnosis  management  and counseling of patients with coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease,10,92,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. James Roberts Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired steelworker  Past medical history:   1. Hypertension for 15 years  managed with lisinopril. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  managed with metformin. 3. Dyslipidemia  managed with atorvastatin. 4. Family history of coronary artery disease; father died of a heart attack at the age of 72. 5. Smoking history of 20 pack-years  but sober for 5 years now. 6. Moderate alcohol consumption.  Key Complaints:   Mr. Roberts has visited the Emergency Department with chief complaints of:   1. Chest Pain: He describes it as a heavy crushing pain in the center of the chest that radiates to the left arm and jaw. The pain started approximately one hour ago while he was mowing his lawn. It’s not relieving with rest and graded as 8 on a scale of 10. 2. Shortness of Breath: He reports difficulty breathing along with the onset of chest pain. 3. Diaphoresis: Profuse sweating noticed along with chest pain.  Additional Notes:  This case was designed for medical students to study the correlation between demographic factors and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Emphasis is placed on the patient's key risk factors including age  race  gender  previous medical history  family history of CAD  and lifestyle factors including smoking and alcohol consumption. The students will also learn to appreciate the nature of chest pain commonly associated with CAD progression. 
Coronary artery disease,10,93,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 64-year-old African American male  retired mechanic  living in an urban setting. He is currently living with his wife. The patient is a former heavy smoker  having quit 8 years ago  but reports a 35 pack-year history. He is known to have a moderate level of physical activity but continues to battle obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. Patient history shows an unhealthy diet high in saturated fats and trans fats. The patient reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both of which have been managed with medication for the past 10 years. There’s also a record of dyslipidemia for which he has been inconsistent with his statin therapy. The patient's father died of myocardial infarction at 56 years old  indicating a family history of cardiovascular disease.   Chief Complaints: The patient presents with a 2-week history of intermittent  troubling chest pain that he describes as 'pressure-like'  frequently occurring during physical exertion like climbing stairs or heavy lifting  often resolving at rest. He additionally reports noticing an increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion that he initially attributed to his weight. He is also experiencing episodes of diaphoresis and mild nausea. He denies any recent trauma  cough  fever  or palpitations.   This case scenario was designed to represent the profile of a typical patient with coronary artery disease risk as per literature demographic  which often involves older age  male gender  African American ethnicity  and a history of risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  family history of heart disease  smoking  unhealthy diet  physical inactivity  and obesity.
Coronary artery disease,10,94,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Demographics: Mr. Michael Dalton  a 65-year-old African American male  retired banker  non-smoker  resides in urban Houston  Texas. He lives with his wife and has a BMI of 30. His family history is significant for CAD  with his father having suffered a heart attack at the age of 68.   Past Medical History: Mr. Dalton has a known case of Hypertension for the past 15 years for which he takes Amlodipine 5mg daily. He also has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DMT2) diagnosed 10 years back and is on Metformin 1000mg per day. He had attended a health check-up 1 year ago and his blood pressure  blood sugar  and lipid profile were under control.   Key Complaints: Two weeks ago  Michael visited his doctor complaining of recent episodes of mild and diffuse chest discomfort over the past several weeks. He described the pain as a pressure sensation  primarily in the sternal region  rated 6/10  lasting for 10-15 minutes and typically occurring during physical exertion. No radiation of pain was reported. Michael found that rest or cessation of activity typically caused the pain to disappear.  The episodes were becoming more frequent over time  now happening 2-3 times per week  and increasingly interfering with his daily activities. He also mentioned feeling slightly more breathless than usual when climbing stairs  which used to be an easy task. However  he has not noted any palpitations  syncope  sweating  nausea  or vomiting.   This case report represents the typical demographics for Coronary Artery Disease. Coronary artery disease  a leading cause of morbidity and mortality  is more common in adults older than 60 years  males particularly African American and Hispanics due to a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes  and individuals with risk factors such as obesity  family history of CAD  smoking  hypertension  and diabetes.
Coronary artery disease,10,95,"Case Report: Cardiovascular Disease - Coronary Artery Disease  Patient Information: - 63 years old Male - African American - Occupation: Retired engineer - Smoking status: Ex-smoker (quit at age of 55) - Marital status: Married - Weight: 210lbs; Height: 5’8” - Residence: Urban area  Cleveland  Ohio  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with hypertension at 50 years old; managed with hydrochlorothiazide - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 58 years old; managed with metformin - No previous surgeries or hospitalizations - Family history of hypertension and coronary artery disease (father died at age 64 due to heart attack)    Presenting Complaints: - Patient has been experiencing intermittent chest discomfort  primarily on exertion over last 4 months. - The patient notices the discomfort particularly when climbing stairs and describes the discomfort as a """"heaviness in the chest"""". - Episodes usually last for less than 10 minutes and are relieved by rest. - The patient also reports episodes of shortness of breath  fatigue  and light-headedness for the same duration.  Differential diagnosis: - Coronary artery disease - Stable angina - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Panic anxiety disorder   Considering the patient's symptoms  age  background including a family history of coronary artery disease  the priority would be to rule out or confirm coronary artery disease. However  a comprehensive approach should be taken also addressing other potential causes of chest pain.   Note: Demographics are representative of many risk factors associated with coronary heart disease. The African American population experiences early onset of hypertension  a well-known risk factor. Moreover  men are more likely to experience coronary artery disease than premenopausal women. The patient is also in a typical age bracket (over 60)  and has multiple risk factors including smoking history and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is thought that about half of men and a third of women over 40 will develop some form of cardiovascular disease in their lifetime."
Coronary artery disease,10,96,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 58 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian  - Occupation: Corporate Lawyer - Marital Status: Married  with 2 children  Past Medical History:  - Smoking for 30 years  quit at age 53. - Chronic hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled on medication. - Moderate hypercholesterolemia.  - Father passed away from myocardial infarction at age 63. - Maternal uncle diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD).  Key Complaints:  Mr. Doe has presented with the primary complaint of experiencing a heavy  squeezing chest pain for the last three days. The pain seems to radiate towards his left shoulder and it gets worse with exertion and eases with rest. In the last 24 hours  the chest pain has become more frequent  happening at least 3-4 times per day  even at rest. He also mentions slight shortness of breath and feeling unusually fatigued for the past 5 days. He reports feeling nauseous but no vomiting  observations of leg swelling  or weight gain.  This clinical case is fairly typical of the demographics found in coronary artery disease literature. According to the American Heart Association  coronary artery disease  also known as ischemic heart disease  is more commonly found in males over the age of 45 (especially those of Caucasian descent) with a history of smoking  hypertension  and familial cardiac events. Similarly  the complaints presented by Mr. John Doe are very typical of a patient with coronary artery disease  hence the need for further assessment and diagnostic tests.  The purpose of this case study is to enhance recognition of coronary artery disease presenting symptoms  enriched medical history-taking  understanding the significance of familial history  and investigating  diagnosing  and managing appropriately.
Coronary artery disease,10,97,Case Report - Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient's information:  Name: Mr. John Williams Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Insurance Agent Residential Area: Suburban  Past Medical History:  Mr. Williams has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which have been managed with medication for the past ten years. He is also a former smoker  having quit about five years ago but reports a 30-pack year smoking history. He enjoys a diet high in saturated fats and automotive activity is his main form of exercise. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his elder sister has been recently diagnosed with atherosclerosis.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Williams reported an onset of intermittent chest pain that occurs during physical exertion such as walking uphill or climbing stairs but subsides when at rest. The pain is described as heavy and squeezing  located in the center of the chest and sometimes radiating to the left arm. He also mentioned experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and occasional dizziness. Over the past month  he has noticed that these symptoms have increased in frequency and that it takes less exertion to provoke them than before. He also reported that symptoms had started to wake him from his sleep  which is a newer manifestation.    Given the typical findings and his risk factors (hypertension  type-2 diabetes  high cholesterol diet  genetics  age  sex  and smoking history)  a preliminary diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease should be considered. Next steps would be to carry out diagnostic tests  including but not limited to an electrocardiogram  stress tests  and angiogram for confirmation of the diagnosis.  This scenario provides an opportunity for students to critically evaluate a patient's history  risk factors  and symptoms  formulating a likely diagnosis and arranging appropriate investigations. It encourages exploration of the pathophysiological links between risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia and the development of CAD. It is essential for students to recognize these links in order to understand the disease process  provide advice about lifestyle modification  report risks involved  and ensure the prompt diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

Coronary artery disease,10,98,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease   Patient Information:  Mr. Marcus Johnson  a 68-year old African American male  currently residing in a suburban neighborhood in New York City  comes to our attention. He is a retired banker  a non-smoker  but has a 30-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 38  and type 2 diabetes mellitus at the age of 40  both of which are being managed with medication (Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes). He has had no recent hospitalizations. The family history includes a father who died of myocardial infarction at 70 and a mother who had stroke in her late 60s.  Present Complaint:  For the past couple of months  Mr. Johnson has experienced frequent episodes of chest discomfort  especially while walking his dog or climbing stairs. At first  he attributed the discomfort to old age and physical unfitness. However  the discomfort  a gripping sensation that often radiates towards his left shoulder  has become more frequent and recently  it occurred at rest. The pain relieves upon taking rest. However  the growing intensity of the discomfort prompted him to seek medical assistance.   Other symptoms Mr. Johnson has noticed include increased frequency of urination  fatigue  and dizziness. He denies any problems with his vision. He does not report any symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia  indicating that his diabetes is possibly under control.   Note: The incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is higher among African Americans  with an even higher prevalence among those with comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension. The patient's age  gender  race  and comorbid conditions are consistent with the typical risk factors for CAD.
Coronary artery disease,10,99,Case Report: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. Thompson Age: 65 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Location: New York  USA  lives alone but has a supportive neighbor. Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History:  1. Hyperlipidemia diagnosed at the age of 58 years. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus since the age of 60. 3. Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago  smoked one pack a day for 40 years). 4. No known history of hypertension or any other cardiac diseases. 5. Father passed away from a heart attack at the age 68.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Thompson visits the outpatient department with complaints of recurrent chest pain for the last one month  commonly initiated by physical activity or emotional stress. He describes it as a heaviness in the center of his chest  which radiates towards his left arm and jaw. The pain generally lasts for about 15-20 minutes and has been subsiding with rest  but is noticeably getting more frequent. The pain is never present while at rest. In addition  he mentioned experiencing episodes of excessive sweating and feeling out of breath during these episodes.  Note: This patient case attempts to depict the typical demographic and lifestyle factors associated with coronary artery disease. Epidemiologically  CAD is more common among males  elderly individuals  Caucasians  and those with a history of hyperlipidemia  Type 2 DM  and smoking. Furthermore  the chosen complaints are representative of chronic stable angina  an important manifestation of CAD. However  patient presentations can vary widely  and CAD also occurs in those outside of these demographics.
