Aortic Dissection,1,1,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Introduction:  Mr. John Owens  a 65-year-old African American male  presents with severe chest pain that began suddenly while he was at home. He describes the pain as sharp and radiating to his back. He further elaborates that the intensity of the pain is unlike anything he has ever experienced. Mr. Owens also reports difficulty breathing. He does not report any signs of other circulatory problems such as numbness or coldness in his extremities.  Demographics:  Aortic dissection is more common in males and can occur at any age  but it tends to be most common in people in their 60s and 70s. According to several large case studies  about 60% of people with aortic dissection are men  and about 50% are White. However  African American men like Mr. Owens represent a large demographic group likely to self-report aortic dissection as well.   Mr. Owens is a retired construction worker  a non-smoker  and does not consume alcohol. He lives with his wife and is generally physically active.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Owens has a documented history of untreated hypertension  which is a well-known risk factor for aortic dissection. For the past five years  he has consistently had blood pressure readings of 145/95 mmHg and above  indicative of stage 2 hypertension.   He also has a history of atherosclerosis  a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries. This condition can weaken the arterial wall and make it more susceptible to dissection.   He does not have any known connective tissue disorders nor any family history of aortic disease. He has been on occasional pain medication for osteoarthritis but does not take any regular prescription drugs.  Summary:  Given Mr. Owens’ symptoms and history of untreated hypertension and atherosclerosis  the preliminary diagnosis is aortic dissection. The immediate priority is to stabilize him  control his blood pressure  and alleviate his pain. Further diagnostic investigations like CT angiogram will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed  he'll require immediate medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. 
Aortic Dissection,1,2,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  I. Patient Introduction  We present a case of a 65-year-old African American male  a retired postman  known to be hypertensive for the past 15 years  presenting with aortic dissection.  II. Demographics  Our patient belongs to the African American ethnicity  aligning with the literature that reveals increased prevalence of aortic disease in this particular racial group. Aged 65 years  this falls within the commonly affected age group for aortic dissection which is between 60 and 70 years for men. Furthermore  our patient is a male  in alignment with prior studies indicating an increased risk for aortic dissection in men compared to women.  III. Past Medical History  The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years  a known primary risk factor for aortic dissection  managed with a daily regimen of Lisinopril and Amlodipine. The patient gave history of being a former smoker  having quit 10 years back. He has no known history of hypercholesterolemia  diabetes  peripheral artery disease  or Marfan syndrome. There is no family history of aortic aneurysms or dissections. His only surgical history is an appendectomy he underwent in his 20s.   IV. Summary  Our patient  a hypertensive  elderly African American male  represents a more common type patient at risk and affected by aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,3,"Title: Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Patient Presentation:  Ms. A is a 67-year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. She lives alone and is a retired school teacher. She has been self-medicating her hypertension with antihypertensives that were prescribed a few years ago  but she has not checked in with her primary care physician for a review since she retired. She has a 30 pack-year smoking history  which she quit 5 years ago  but has had irregular follow-ups since then.  Presentation:  Ms. A presented to emergency care with sudden onset  severe chest pain that began two hours before hospital admission. She described the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  rated at a 10 on a scale of 0 to 10  located at the center of her chest and radiating to her back. She reported feeling weak and light-headed but denied any associated symptoms like cough or fever. She has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  she was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 200/120 mmHg in the right arm and 170/100 mmHg in the left arm. Her heart rate was 110 beats per minute  and she was perspiring heavily. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur. Pulses were palpable but weaker in the lower limbs compared to the upper limbs.  Patient History:  Following the physical exam and medical history collection  it was determined that Ms. A was at significant risk for aortic dissection given her history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  all of which are factors that contribute to weakness in the wall of the aorta.  Evaluation and Diagnosis:  Based on her clinical presentation and risk factors  aortic dissection was suspected. An urgent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection (Type A)  demonstrating an intimal flap with true and false lumen in the ascending aorta.  This case emphasizes the critical importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissections  given the high mortality rate associated with this condition. The patient's demographic data  clinical presentation  and medical history contributed to the diagnostic conclusion. The role of regular patient follow-ups and consistent hypertension management is evident in preventing such complications."
Aortic Dissection,1,4,"Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection   Patient Information: Mr. J. Gutierrez  a 66-year-old Hispanic male  Primary Complaint: Mr. Gutierrez presented to the emergency department with a complaint of acute  severe chest pain that started an hour ago. The pain was described as a """"tearing or ripping"""" sensation that radiated to the back.   Medical History:  The patient has a ten-year history of tobacco use  although he ceased smoking eight years ago. He has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past decade and has been inconsistently compliant with antihypertensive medications due to financial constraints. Furthermore  he has a confirmed diagnosis of peripheral artery disease five years prior and has undergone subsequent angioplasty procedures. Mr. Gutierrez has no known allergies. His family history is significant with an older brother who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  Investigations:  On examination  the patient was anxious and diaphoretic  with unequal pulses and blood pressure recordings between the right and left arms. A chest X-ray and a CT angiogram confirmed an intimal tear and a dissection flap  suggestive of aortic dissection. His blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels  while other lab values  including complete blood count  kidney function  and cardiac enzymes  were within normal limits.  Impression: Mr. Gutierrez is diagnosed with acute Type A aortic dissection which requires emergent surgical intervention due to increased risk of aortic rupture and serious complications. His uncontrolled hypertension  peripheral artery disease  and history of smoking all contribute to his increased risk of aortic dissection. The need to control blood pressure to prevent further propagation of dissection is stressed. Moreover  the importance of continuing medical therapy and follow-up to monitor and manage hypertension effectively will continue to be discussed with the patient.   The choice of this case is based on various studies and literature which indicate that the incidence of aortic dissection is higher among males  individuals above 60 years  smokers  and individuals with high blood pressure. Hispanics  like Mr. Gutierrez  are known to have a relatively high prevalence of hypertension  contributing to their risk of cardiovascular conditions."
Aortic Dissection,1,5,Patient Presentation:  Patient K.B. is a 69-year-old African American male presenting with complaints of intense  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction five years ago. The pain appeared suddenly today and has been progressively worsening. Furthermore  he reports feeling lightheaded and nauseous since the pain began.   Past Medical History:  In addition to hypertensive heart disease  patient K.B. has a history of cigarette smoking (35 pack years) and a family history revealing that his father experienced a similar episode of aortic dissection in his early 70s. Furthermore  patient K.B. has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications prescribed to him for managing his hypertension  explaining his currently uncontrolled blood pressure.   Social History:  Patient K.B. lives alone  is retired  and has two adult children living out-of-state. He is a former automotive technician. He denies alcohol or drug misuse  but acknowledges smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 70 years  though he claims he cut down since his myocardial infarction. He does not engage in regular physical exercise and has a diet rich in sodium and fats.  Demographic Considerations:  According to literature  aortic dissection is more common in males and risks increase with age  hence our patient’s age and gender are crucial demographic parameters. Aortic dissection is also twice as common in black individuals according to some studies  which means K.B.'s race is another important demographic factor. Lastly  socioeconomic factors such as healthcare access and lifestyle choices influenced by education and income levels can impact the control of risk factors like hypertension  as seen in K.B.'s case.   This comprehensive patient presentation attempts to illustrate the typical demographic profile and pertinent past medical history of a person who might present with aortic dissection  as per the existing literature. 
Aortic Dissection,1,6,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Male with Predisposing Hypertension and Smoking History   Introduction:  I'd like to present a case of aortic dissection in a 65-year-old Hispanic male. The prevalence of aortic dissection is higher amongst males with hypertension and histories of tobacco use  as seen in this patient.  Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic male  a retired construction worker  who currently lives with his wife. He is born and raised in San Diego  California.   Medical history:   The patient has a significant past medical history  primarily characterized by hypertension for 15 years  which has been poorly controlled due to medication noncompliance. Existing literature suggests a strong correlation between hypertension and aortic dissection  with hypertensive patients being at a significantly higher risk.   The patient also has a 35-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 71. Smoking and family history further increase the risk.  Symptoms:  The patient presented to the hospital complaining of severe chest pain that started while he was gardening. He described the pain as 'tearing' and 'like nothing I've ever felt before ' that began in the front of his chest and radiated to his back.   Physical examination:  Upon examination  the patient appeared to be in severe distress. His blood pressure was elevated  with a significant difference recorded between the two arms. The difference in blood pressures and the features of the pain experienced pointed to a probable diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Further assessments for definitive diagnosis of aortic dissection  treatment plan  and anticipated outcome may follow  but this information pertains to the initial presentation of the case. This patient's case underscores the importance of managing hypertension and quitting smoking  as both are major risk factors for the development of an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,7,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 60-year-old African American man brought to the emergency department due to sudden severe chest pain. He has a medical history significative of hypertension  which has been difficult to control despite the use of a combination of antihypertensive medications. His pain began suddenly about an hour ago and was described as sharp  tearing  and radiating to his back. His vital signs at presentation were blood pressure 170/98 mm Hg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed signs of hypertension (left ventricular hypertrophy and retinopathy) and diaphoresis. He denied any previous injuries or recent increased physical strain. He is a non-smoker  drinks occasionally  and denies any known drug allergies.  Significance: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening event that mostly occurs in men aged 60–70 years  and hypertension remains the most common clinical condition associated with it. African Americans have a higher incidence of aortic dissection and rupture than Caucasians  who  in turn  have a higher incidence than Latinos and people of Asian descent. Uncontrolled systemic hypertension is seen in more than three-fourths of patients with aortic dissection  making immediate and aggressive management crucial. Further examination for the patient would include imaging modalities to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the dissection  such as computed tomography with contrast  magnetic resonance imaging  or transesophageal echocardiography. The presenting symptoms  history of hypertension  and initial examination findings align closely with those observed in individuals suffering from aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,8,Title: Aortic Dissection Case: A 66-year-old African American Male  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a severe condition that presents when the inner layer of the aorta experiences a tear. Blood surges through the tear  often forcing the inner and middle layers of the largest artery in the body apart— a phenomenon known as aortic dissection. Immediate treatment can be lifesaving  but mortality rates remain high  despite advancements in diagnostics and surgical techniques.  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 66-year-old African American male  Mr. James Williams. He's office-based by profession and is a widowed father of three.   Past Medical History: Mr. Williams has a significant history of hypertension  which has been under control with antihypertensives for 15 years. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and controlled Type 2 diabetes. There was a past smoking history of 20 pack-years before it was quit in 2004. Nonsurgical history includes a myocardial infarction eight years ago that has since been managed with medication and lifestyle changes. Furthermore  he was diagnosed and treated for peripheral artery disease five years back. Genetic history reveals that his father died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 72.  Presentation and Symptoms: Mr. Williams presented with sudden severe stabbing pain in his chest and back that he rated a 10 on a 10-point scale. The patient also described transient weakness in the left side of his body  which lasted approximately 30 minutes  sweating  and shortness of breath.  Conclusion: Considering his age  race  and gender  Mr. Williams does fall into a high-risk category for aortic dissection. The NIH reports that men in their 60s and 70s are at a higher risk for aortic dissection and that  in the United States  Black individuals have a higher likelihood of experiencing and dying from arterial dissection. Mr. Williams' hypertension  family history of aortic aneurysm  smoking  and other vascular comorbidities also increases his potential risk. The sudden onset of severe pain in his chest and back  with symptoms of diaphoresis  shortness of breath  and transient weakness in the left side  affirms a case of acute aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,1,9,"Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile:  A patient  Mr. Alan Smith  lives in a suburban neighborhood in Indiana. He is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  given that aortic dissection is more prevalent among men than women and the incidence increases with age. He has worked as an auto mechanic for the last 45 years  with a history of smoking and occasional alcohol use.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has had a past medical history significant for high blood pressure for the last 20 years  which he manages with medication (Losartan 50 mg daily)  although  non-compliance has led to poorly controlled hypertension. Other significant medical history includes a mild stroke six years ago  for which he is on low-dose aspirin therapy. He also has a record of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia. He has no record of connective tissue disorders.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith was brought to the emergency department presenting sudden onset  severe chest pain described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" that radiated to his back. He also complained of shortness of breath  anxiety  and weakness on his body's one side.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Smith was pale  diaphoretic  and seemed visibly distressed. His blood pressure was significantly different between the two arms  and his pulse was weak. Heart sounds were normal  but a diastolic murmur was present. His respiratory rate was slightly elevated  and he had decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung. The neurological examination showed a mild paresis of his left side  supporting his stroke history.   Preliminary Diagnosis: Considering Mr. Smith's age  sex  clinical manifestations - including hypertension  severe chest and back pain  blood pressure discrepancy between the arms  and respiratory and neurological changes - he is highly suspected of having an aortic dissection. Prompt diagnostic procedures are warranted to confirm this presumptive diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment strategies.   Quick Note: While aortic dissection can affect any age  it is most commonly observed in men aged 60-80 years  especially those with a history of hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Smoking might have contributed to the weakening of his arterial walls  progressively leading to the dissection. It is also noteworthy to consider that the higher prevalence of aortic dissections among Caucasians warrants more focused preventive measures in this demographic group."
Aortic Dissection,1,10,"Title: Clinical presentation of aortic dissection  Patient Profile:   Mr. Samuel  a 60-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe  sudden-onset chest pain.   Medical History:   The patient is a known case of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years. He is also a 20-year smoker with a history of high cholesterol. There is no history of any connective tissue disorders in the patient's familial history. His medication history shows sporadic compliance to antihypertensive medications.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Samuel describes the chest pain as """"tearing"""" and """"sharp """" radiating to the back. He also reports mild dyspnea  dizziness  and mild loss of consciousness. On physical examination  he was found to have an unequal pulse in both arms  elevated blood pressure  diaphoresis  and visibly significant distress.  Generally  aortic dissection is more common in males than females with a roughly 2:1 ratio; Mr. Samuel falls within this higher risk category. The average age of onset is about 60 to 70 years old  though the risk increases with age. Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor  which also corresponds with Mr. Samuel's profile. Furthermore  individuals with a history of smoking  high cholesterol  or a familial history of aortic disease also have an increased risk. While Mr. Samuel does not have a familial history of aortic disease  he is a heavy smoker with high cholesterol  which contributes to his overall risk.  In conclusion  Mr. Samuel's profile  as a hypertensive older African American male smoker  makes him a very likely candidate for aortic dissection  underlining the importance of aggressively managing his presenting symptoms and considering immediate diagnostic modalities. His experience of sudden  severe chest pain  unequal pulses  and other associated symptoms are classic for aortic dissection  necessitating immediate attention and treatment. "
Aortic Dissection,1,11,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Introduction:  The case presented here is a representation derived from literature on typical patients with aortic dissection. The demographic details align with the fact that aortic dissection most commonly affects men in their 60s and 70s.  Demographics: Patient X is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired and lives with his spouse. He is an ex-smoker and has been abstinent from alcohol for the past five years. He has a past history of hypertension that has been diagnosed 15 years ago. Apart from hypertension  the patient has been generally healthy throughout his life  and there is no family history suggestive of any hereditary disease.   Medical and Clinical History: Patient X has been managing hypertension with medication and has been clinically stable. His blood pressure at his last check-up was recorded as 140/90 mmHg. The patient has no significant past interventions or surgical history apart from an appendectomy performed at the age of 25. He has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaint: Patient X was brought to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was sudden and severe in intensity. He reports feeling as though something had """"torn"""" inside his chest  accompanied by dizziness and shortness of breath.   Given his hypertensive history  sudden onset chest pain  and the tearing nature of the pain  an emergency CT scan was requested suspecting an aortic dissection.  Conclusion: This case is representative of the demographic most commonly afflicted with aortic dissections: an elderly  hypertensive male presenting with sudden  intense  and tearing chest pain. The presentation and demographics align closely with literature on aortic dissections. However  it should also be noted that aortic dissection can occur in a much broader age range and in females  though to a lesser extent."
Aortic Dissection,1,12,Presentation Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Introduction  Patient: Mr. Richard Lancaster  a 65-year-old Caucasian male presented at the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain.  Slide 2: Demographics  According to literature  aortic dissection is more common in males  especially in their sixth or seventh decade of life. The patient’s ethnic background is another significant consideration  wherein  Caucasians have a higher probability of aortic dissection compared to African Americans.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Lancaster reported a severe  sharp pain originating in his chest and radiating to his back. He also complained of shortness of breath and light headedness. This sudden and severe pain pattern is typical in aortic dissection cases.  Slide 4: Past Medical History   Mr. Lancaster has a known history of hypertension  which he admits he has not managed well. His other medical background includes high cholesterol levels and intermittent smoking habit. He had survived a heart attack five years back. These risk factors increase the propensity for aortic dissection.   Slide 5: Physical Examination and Diagnosis  On examination  there was a noticeable difference in blood pressure between his arms. An immediate CT was performed to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection. The scan revealed an intimal flap with a false lumen  confirming a diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection.   Slide 6: Discussion  Mr. Lancaster's case is representative of typical demographic and risk factors associated with aortic dissection  including advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  smoking  and previous cardiovascular disease. Prompt recognition of symptoms and immediate radiological assessment is crucial for life-saving treatment.   Slide 7: Conclusion  Early detection and management can significantly improve outcomes in aortic dissection. Therefore  a high index of suspicion and prompt use of diagnostic tools should be applied in patients presenting with acute  severe chest or back pain – especially those in the high-risk demographic and with associated risk factors.
Aortic Dissection,1,13,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with severe  unrelenting chest pain radiating to his back. The patient reported that the pain started suddenly while he was climbing a set of stairs at his home about one hour ago. Mr. Rodriguez equates his pain's intensity with that of when he suffered an anterior wall myocardial infarction 5 years ago.  Demographics:  Mr. Rodriguez lives in San Antonio  Texas  with his wife of 40 years. He is a retired school teacher and enjoys gardening and reading books during his leisure time.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant medical history of hypertension managed by Lisinopril  diabetes type 2 controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents  and hyperlipidemia  for which he is on statins for the last 8 years. His medical records also reveal a previous myocardial infarction about 5 years ago which was managed at that time with percutaneous coronary intervention to his right coronary artery and since then he's on dual antiplatelet therapy. He has no known allergies to medications. Mr. Rodriguez reports daily alcohol use but no smoking or illicit drug use.  Discussion:  Mr. Rodriguez’s presentation is suggestive of an aortic dissection. It is three times more common among men and Black individuals compared to their White counterparts  and Hispanics fall in an intermediate risk group. The average age of presentation is in the 60s  which aligns with Mr. Rodriguez’s age. Hypertension  which is in his medical history  is the most common risk factor  present in over 75 percent of cases (per UpToDate). Specifically  an acute rise in blood pressure may result in shear stress that triggers aortic dissection. Furthermore  his past medical history of coronary artery disease increases his risk of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,14,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Male Patient  I. Patient Demographics Mr. Johnson is a 59-year-old African American man  currently residing in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. He is employed in a high-stress job as an investment banker. His family history is significant with his father having passed away from a stroke at the age of 64  and his mother having a medical history of hypertension.   II. Presenting Complaint and Symptoms: The patient presents with severe  sudden onset chest pain that he describes as 'tearing' and radiating to his back. He appears anxious and is profusely sweating. Mr. Johnson also reports associated symptoms of dyspnea and syncope. He mentions experiencing mild chest discomfort over the past few weeks  which he attributed to work stress and did not seek medical attention.   III. Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of untreated hypertension and has been a regular smoker for the past 35 years. He was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia five years ago but is non-compliant with his statin medication. These medical histories increase his risk for atherosclerosis and subsequent development of aortic dissection. The patient denies any history of trauma or surgery in the chest area.  IV. Summary: Based on his demographic and reported medical history  Mr. Johnson fits the typical profile associated with aortic dissection. The literature indicates that aortic dissection is more common in males ages 50 to 70  especially in those with untreated hypertension and atherosclerosis. The acute onset of severe  ripping chest pain and dyspnea emphasizes the importance of immediate and emergent attention for Mr. Johnson as untreated aortic dissection can lead to severe complications such as cardiac tamponade  aortic rupture  and stroke.  Please note that this clinical scenario is depicted for a fictional patient and individual patient presentations may vary  based on numerous factors  including lifestyle  genetic predisposition  and adherence to treatment plans. 
Aortic Dissection,1,15,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: A 65-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 20-pack year history of smoking  presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe  tearing chest and back pain.   History of Present Illness: The patient describes the headache as severe and sudden onset  radiating to the neck and lower back  with a score of 9 on the pain scale  and unlike any pain experienced before. His symptoms started roughly 2 hours ago  prompting immediate attention. He denies other signs or symptoms  such as syncope  dyspnea  paraplegia  pulse deficit  or clinical signs of shock.   Past Medical History: The patient has long-standing uncontrolled hypertension for over 20 years  with poor medication compliance. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago which is currently being managed with statins. Besides  the patient has a history of heavy smoking  averaging a pack a day for the last 20 years  albeit he quit five years ago.   Social History: The patient lives with his wife  is retired  and reports occasional alcohol use. He denies any recreational drug use. He worked as a truck driver for several decades and admits to a sedentary lifestyle.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  his blood pressure reading is significantly asymmetrical (right arm: 170/90 mmHg  left arm: 140/80 mmHg). Heart sounds are normal with no audible murmur. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: Given the patient's presentation and risk factors  the clinical suspicion for an aortic dissection is high. Emergent imaging  possibly a CT angiogram  will be pursued to confirm the diagnosis.   In conclusion  this case illustrates the classic presentation of aortic dissection in a patient with known risk factors – age over 60  male  African-American ethnicity  history of hypertension and smoking. Prompt diagnosis is crucial in this potentially life-threatening medical emergency. 
Aortic Dissection,1,16,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Introduction:  Today  we will discuss a patient with an aortic dissection. This condition involves a tear in the aorta's inner layer  causing blood to surge through the tear  potentially leading to aortic rupture - a life-threatening situation.  Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. T. He hails from Los Angeles  California and is a retired engineer.  Presenting Issue:  Mr. T presented to the emergency department reporting a sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiated to his back. He described the pain as sharp and tearing in nature which started while he was at rest.  Past Medical History:  Upon investigation  Mr. T revealed that he is a chronic smoker with a pack-a-day habit for the past 40 years. He has also been diagnosed with high blood pressure  which is usually controlled with antihypertensive drugs  and mild obesity. Unfortunately  Mr. T has been non-compliant with his blood pressure medication and his diet control plan. He has no history of surgeries or notable genetic predispositions. He denied any history of illicit drug use.   Demographic relevance: According to literature  aortic dissection is more common in males than females  with a higher prevalence in the 6th to 8th decade of life. African Americans and smokers with high blood pressure are at a higher risk of aortic dissection which aligns with Mr. T’s profile.  Conclusion: In light of the escalating crisis of cardiovascular diseases in the culturally diverse population in the United States  it's essential to acknowledge the role of racial  ethnic  and socioeconomic disparities  among other factors. The discussion around our patient  Mr. T  a retiree who's not only a chronic smoker with uncontrolled hypertension  but also represents a disproportionately affected demographic group  puts into perspective the necessity of proactive  culturally competent healthcare delivery. It also underlines the importance of patient education and adherence to treatment plans.   References: (Ensure to include real sources used for the presentation)
Aortic Dissection,1,17,"Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographic Information:  The patient  Mr. Jackson  is a 63-year-old African-American male who is a resident of Bronx  New York. He is married with two adult daughters and worked as a mechanic until retirement. He has a 30 pack-years smoking history but quit smoking five years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally. His family has a history of hypertension  with both his father and grandfather being hypertensive.  Patient History:  The patient has a well-documented past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years  which he manages with anti-hypertensive medication. His medication compliance is suboptimal. Additionally  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease three years ago. His lipid profile is fair but has shown a decreasing trend in the most recent check-ups.   Presentation:  Mr. Jackson presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back  reminiscent of """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""". The onset of pain was at rest. On a scale of 1-10  he rates the pain as a 10  stating it as the worst pain he has ever experienced. He is visibly anxious  pale  hypotensive  diaphoretic  and has an irregular pulse. The pain is not relieved by nitroglycerin.  In his vital signs  we notice a significant difference in the blood pressures of the two arms. The ECG confirms abnormalities consistent with hypertensive heart disease but does not find any ST-segment elevation or depression. High index of suspicion for aortic dissection exists based on the patient's symptoms  history  and presentation.  Discussion:  Mr. Jackson’s presentation is characteristic of aortic dissection  a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and management to prevent potentially fatal complications such as aortic rupture or organ malperfusion. His history of uncontrolled hypertension and peripheral artery disease are risk factors for this condition. Mixed race individuals  especially African-American males  experience high prevalence rates. Given his high-risk profile  an immediate CT angiogram should conduct to confirm the diagnosis."
Aortic Dissection,1,18,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old  Hispanic male  who has been brought into our emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating through to the back. Consistent with the literature  Mr. Rodriguez's demographic background  specifically his age  gender  and ethnicity  is highly indicative of an increased risk for aortic dissection  as numerous studies report males over the age of 60  particularly of Hispanic ethnicity  are more susceptible.  Upon further investigation  it was reported that his pain begun while he was at rest  and he describes it as being very sharp  almost a tearing or ripping sensation. He also presents with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  recurrent smoking habits  and a familial history of cardiovascular conditions  all contributing risk factors for aortic disposition.  Considering his past medical history  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago however  he does not comply with his medication regimen consistently due to associated side effects. He has been a pack-a-day smoker for approximately 35 years. Additionally  his father has a history of aneurysm and his mother died from a stroke at an early age.  Given the nature of his chest pain and medical history  our primary differential diagnosis is an acute aortic dissection. Immediate diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions have been ordered to mitigate the risk of mortality and morbidity from the suspected aortic dissection. Further management will also include prompt treatment of the hypertension and smoking cessation to reduce the likelihood of future aortic or cardiovascular events.   During his stay  we plan to also involve the hospital's social services to assist with smoking cessation programs and medication adherence education considering the chronic nature of his hypertension. It is crucial to educate Mr. Rodriguez on the importance of lifestyle adjustments and consistent medication usage in managing his risk factors and potentially preventing future events.
Aortic Dissection,1,19,"Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Background:  Patient's Full Name: John Doe  Age: 66 years old  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian   Mr. John Doe  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to our Emergency Department with a chief complaint of sudden severe """"tearing"""" chest pain that radiates to the back. He describes it as the worst pain he's ever experienced.   His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and occasional instances of moderate drinking. His family history includes a paternal uncle who died due to aortic dissection  and his father suffered from a stroke when he was 72.   He has never smoked and was previously employed as a construction worker before retirement. He resides with his wife in the local area.  Presentation:  Upon initial assessment  his vitals were as follows: Blood Pressure (BP) - 185/90 mmHg  Pulse rate – 96 beats per minute  O2 saturation – 98% on room air.   Physical examination revealed diaphoresis  anxiety  and pale skin. No signs of neurological deficits or pulse discrepancies between the upper and lower extremities were observed.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  His electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show any signs of Myocardial Infarction but an initial chest X-ray showed a widening of the mediastinum. Blood tests demonstrated slightly elevated cardiac enzymes.   A Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford type A  aortic dissection.  Treatment Plan:  Emergency cardiovascular surgical consultation was conducted and urgent surgical intervention - Aortic Dissection Repair - was planned.  Discussion:  The case emphasizes the importance of immediate recognition and treatment of aortic dissection  which often presents as sudden severe chest or back pain. The patient’s risk factors  such as age  male gender  known history of hypertension  and family history of aortic dissection  contributed to this life-threatening condition. Therefore  an effective treatment plan is crucial to ensure patient’s survival and to reduce potential complications.   This case also underscores the importance of ensuring regular follow-ups and proper management of hypertension to prevent severe complications like aortic dissection. It further stresses the need for genetic screening for individuals with a family history of aortic diseases."
Aortic Dissection,1,20,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 66-year-old African American male presenting with a complaint of sudden  severe chest pain with a 'tearing' or 'ripping' sensation radiating to his back. The onset of pain was """"out of the blue""""  and the patient describes it as the most severe pain he has ever experienced. He also reports sweating  nausea  and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension  managed with an ACE inhibitor  and a past medical history of smoking for over 35 years (20 cigarettes a day)  but quit five years ago. Furthermore  he has high cholesterol  for which he has been treated on statins for the last 10 years. He has no formal diagnosis of diabetes or other significant cardiovascular diseases. He does not have a history of Marfan syndrome or any known connective tissue disorder  and there is no family history of aortic dissection. His weight is on the upper side  with a Body Mass Index of 29.  Demographics Information:  This is consistent with epidemiological factors linked to aortic dissection. The incidence of aortic dissection is high among males aged 60-80  and particularly among African Americans. Risk factors such as long-term hypertension  smoking  and dyslipidemia are commonly associated with aortic dissection. While younger patients with aortic dissection often have a genetic predisposition  like connective tissue disorders  it is less frequent in the older population  like our patient.   Conclusion:  Given this patient’s symptoms and risk factors  aortic dissection should be high in the differential diagnosis. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate diagnostic confirmation  typically with a CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiography  and prompt treatment."
Aortic Dissection,1,21,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnathan Reed is a 65-year-old African-American male whose chief complaint is a sudden onset of severe and sharp chest pain that radiated to his back. The pain started approximately two hours ago while he was mowing his lawn. Mr. Reed describes the pain as 'tearing' and rated it 8 out of 10. He also reports feeling a bit lightheaded with mild dyspnea.   Demographic Information:  Mr. Reed is a retired auto-mechanic  he has a history of high blood pressure for which he has been poorly adherent with his medication. He has a 20-pack year smoking history  although he quit smoking around 10 years ago. His alcohol use is moderate-to-low. Mr. Reed resides in the suburbs with his wife of 40 years. Their adult children live nearby.   Past Medical History:  In addition to hypertensive cardiovascular disease  Mr. Reed suffers from hyperlipidemia for which he takes statins. He also has osteoarthritis in his hips and knees but refuses to take any medication for it. There is no family history of aortic dissection  but there is a family history of early coronary artery disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Mr. Reed has no known drug allergies.  The demographic information and past medical history of Mr. Reed is consistent with typical demographic profiles of patients with aortic dissection as found in the literature  particularly being a male over the age of 60 with hypertension and a history of smoking. His African-American ethnicity also places him at a higher risk as literature suggests that this population has a higher incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases which are predisposing factors for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,22,"Title: A Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Details:  Mr. Stanley Brown  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to his back. He ranks the pain as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the most severe pain imaginable. He describes the pain as """"ripping"""" and """"tearing""""  which commenced approximately an hour ago while he was watching television at home.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown's significant medical history comprises moderate essential hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  and smoking  with a 20 pack-year history. He also has Type 2 diabetes  which was diagnosed ten years ago and is being managed with oral hypoglycemics. His grandmother and father both died due to stroke in their late sixties. He has no known allergies.  Discussion:  Primarily  studies reflect that men are at a higher risk of aortic dissection than women. Furthermore  African Americans have a disproportionately higher prevalence rate of the disease  making Mr. Brown a fitting clinical representation of this literature report. An aggravating factor in this case is hypertension  a leading risk factor for aortic dissection  which causes increased shear stress on the aortic wall. Diabetes and smoking are also significant risk factors  contributing to the weakening of the aortic wall  predisposing to aortic dissection.   Conclusion:  Given Mr. Brown's age  gender  race  and co-morbidities  it's crucial to consider aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis. A prompt definitive diagnostic workup is needed  including further examinations like imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis. This case illustrates the importance of demographic representation and understanding predisposing risk factors in diagnosing and managing clinically significant conditions like aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,1,23,Presentation Title: Aortic Dissection in Elderly Caucasian Male   Introduction:  Good afternoon everyone  today we will be discussing a case of aortic dissection in an elderly patient.   Patient's demographic and medical history:  Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male patient  entered our emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. The patient resides in an urban area and is a retired engineer. He is a married father of two children  both adults.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with hypertension and has been managing it for the last 15 years. He also has a history of high cholesterol and has been on statins for the past 5 years. He underwent angioplasty due to an episode of Acute Myocardial Infarction two years back. He had a smoking history but quit 10 years ago  following a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He regularly monitors his health but admits some recent lapses in his medication adherence due to certain personal issues.  Initial Presentation:  Upon presentation  Mr. Smith complained of a sudden and severe chest pain  similar to the sensation of tearing or ripping  radiating to his back. The onset was sudden  beginning around three hours prior to his arrival at the hospital. He also reported shortness of breath and fainting spells. He showed symptoms of restlessness and was covered in cold sweats.  According to global demographic observations  aortic dissection presents most commonly in men between the ages of 60 and 70  especially those with a history of hypertension. Considering the patient's age  gender  hypertension  and his symptoms at the time of presentation  a provisional diagnosis of aortic dissection was considered.  In conclusion:  This case is a classic example of aortic dissection  one of the most common cardiovascular emergencies. It underscores the importance of immediate identification and intervention for aortic dissection  a condition that commonly presents in elderly males with an existing history of hypertension. This demographic information and the patient’s medical history contributed greatly to the initial diagnosis and management strategy.
Aortic Dissection,1,24,Demographics and Past Medical History: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension  smoking  and high cholesterol. The patient's family history is significant for aortic aneurysm and cardiovascular disease  indicating hereditary predisposition. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications for over 25 years and was diagnosed with high cholesterol about ten years ago  for which he takes a statin. He has a 40-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily  though he quit five years ago.   Clinical Presentation: The patient presented in the emergency department complaining of sudden severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was associated with profuse sweating  dizziness  and nausea. On examination  his blood pressure was significantly different in each arm  with a higher reading in the right arm  and his pulse was irregular. The patient appeared anxious and was in obvious distress.   Given the patient’s medical history and presentation  he was highly suspected to have an aortic dissection. To confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection  the patient was subjected to a CT angiogram which revealed a type B aortic dissection starting just distal to the subclavian arch and extending to the level of the renal arteries.   In summary  this 67-year-old male patient with a significant smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  and a family history of aortic disease  presented with symptoms consistent with an aortic dissection. Timely radiographic examination and rapid management interventions are crucial in this high-risk cardiovascular emergency. His treatment and follow-up will require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to managing this complex condition.   Data Representation: This case represents the typical demographic presentation for aortic dissection. According to literature  most patients with aortic dissections are male  older than 60 years  hypertensive  and have a predilection for smoking. African Americans have a high prevalence of hypertension  which is a known risk factor for aortic dissection. The patient's family history of aortic aneurysms also increases his risk. 
Aortic Dissection,1,25,"Patient Presentation: Mr. Hernandez  Mr. Hernandez is a 65-year-old Hispanic male presenting to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes his pain as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" in nature  and includes dyspnea  diaphoresis and light-headedness. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a 45-year history of smoking.  Accordingly  Mr. Hernandez is in the demographic that is often seen for aortic dissection. Studies have shown that men are at a higher risk than women  especially those aged between 60 and 70  and the condition is becoming increasingly documented in the Hispanic population. Numerous risk factors for aortic dissection have been identified  including hypertension  a history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  and pre-existing aortic aneurysm or aortic valve disease - each of which contributes to Mr. Hernandez's elevated risk.  In conclusion  Mr. Hernandez is a suitable example of a typical patient presenting with aortic dissection  presenting common risk factors found within this demographic such as male gender  older age  hypertension  history of smoking and hyperlipidemia. He exemplifies the importance of considering these risk factors when evaluating a patient presenting with sudden  severe chest pain."
Aortic Dissection,1,26,"Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection   Patient Profile: We have a 65-year-old African American male patient  named Mr. Robert Brown  presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute aortic dissection.  Demographics: Mr. Brown is a retired General Motors assembly line worker and has been living in Detroit  Michigan. He is a widower with three grown children whom he has a close bond with. He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol but does not have a regular exercise regimen.  Medical History: Mr. Brown has been managing hypertension for the past 20 years  controlled with the antihypertensive medication Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  regulated with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 8 years ago for which he takes Atorvastatin. His last visit to his primary care physician was about six months ago  with no complaints at that time.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Brown was brought to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain that began about 3 hours prior to arrival. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"like nothing he has ever felt before."""" The pain radiates to the back and is not relieved by resting or nitroglycerin that was given by the EMS en route to the hospital.  Significantly  the above demographic and medical history representation coincides with the literature which suggests that a higher prevalence of aortic dissection is found in males  aged 60-70 years old  especially among African Americans  and with underlying conditions such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. This case presentation is a classic representation of an aortic dissection patient as depicted in literature."

Aortic Dissection,1,28,[Slide 1: Introduction] Good day everyone  today  I’ll be presenting the case of a patient who presented with an aortic dissection.   [Slide 2: Demographics] Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. According to multiple epidemiological studies  aortic dissection occurs more commonly in males  and the incidence increases with age  which typically peaks in the 6th to 7th decade of life.  [Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms] He presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain began abruptly while he was performing his daily routines. He described it as a sharp tearing sensation. Apart from chest pain  he also mentioned transient loss of consciousness.  [Slide 4: Past Medical History] Significantly  his past medical history revealed a long history of hypertension and a past episode of a transient ischemic attack. He's a chronic smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history and has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases. All these factors place him at higher risk of aortic dissection.  [Slide 5: Clinical Examination] Upon physical examination  he appeared to be in severe distress. His blood pressure was markedly elevated and there was a difference in blood pressures between the arms. A diastolic murmur was heard  indicative of possible aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic dissection.  [Slide 6: Conclusion] In conclusion  this case is a classic representation of aortic dissection in terms of both demographic data and clinical presentation. The combination of advanced age  male gender  chronic hypertension  smoking  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases in this patient underlines the significance of acknowledging identified risk factors in susceptibility to aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,1,29,Presentation Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Study  Introduction: Today  I’ll be presenting the case of an African-American man who was recently diagnosed with a type A aortic dissection.  Demographics: Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male who hails from West Philadelphia  works as a retired schoolteacher  and is a non-smoker and a non-drinker. He lives with his wife and has two adult children.   Medical History: He has an extensive past medical history. He has been battling long-standing systemic hypertension for about 20 years. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels and diabetes mellitus around 10 years back  for which he is on medication. His only surgical history includes hernia repair about 5 years ago. He has no known allergies.   Mr. Johnson has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had an aortic aneurysm and his mother succumbed to stroke. He is not physically active and has been obese for more than a decade  with a current BMI of 31.   Aortic Dissection and Symptoms: Mr. Johnson reported experiencing sudden severe chest pain  describing it to radiate to his back  between the shoulder blades. He also complained of abdominal pain  dizziness  and traces of blood while coughing. Based on these symptoms and his medical history  a CT scan was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Discussion: According to Guideline from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association  it is found that men  individuals above 60 years  and African Americans are more inclined to aortic dissection. Hypertension is the largest risk factor  responsible for nearly 75% of cases of aortic dissection. Other risk factors include smoking  atherosclerosis  pre-existing aortic aneurysm  and family history of the disease.   Conclusion: Our patient’s presentation fitted well with these risk factors - being an African American male above 60 years with hypertension and a significant family history of cardiovascular disease.   The focus  in this case  is to manage hypertension aggressively and adopt a healthier lifestyle. A better understanding of the symptoms that can point towards this dangerous condition is essential for early diagnosis and prompt treatment. This approach can lead to decreased morbidity and mortality in these patients.   Thank you.
Aortic Dissection,1,30,Patient Presentation:  I'd like to present the case of Mr. Jack Donahue  a 62-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the emergency department with severe chest and back pain. Over the past few hours  Mr. Donahue has been experiencing a tearing pain in the midline of his chest  moving backwards towards his spine. The pain was sudden in onset and reached maximum intensity immediately. Initially  he attributed it to indigestion  but the persistence and intensity of the pain prompted him to seek immediate medical attention. He admits to feeling sweaty  nauseated  and light-headed.  A look into Mr. Donahue's medical history reveals hypertension  which he manages with Lisinopril  and high cholesterol  for which he takes Atorvastatin. Additionally  Donahue has a 20-pack-year smoking history  although he quit about 10 years ago. He maintains a diet largely devoid of fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers a diet high in red meats and processed food. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother had an ischemic stroke in her late 60s. However  he has no known allergies and does not consume alcohol.   Upon arrival  Donahue appears pale and anxious. His vital signs revealed a disparity in blood pressure between his right and left arm  and an electrocardiogram showed no signs of myocardial infarction. His body habitus is obese  and he demonstrates some distress related to his pain. His examination was also positive for a diastolic murmur.  Mr. Donahue's demographic and clinical presentation are typical for aortic dissection. Statistically  the condition is more prevalent in males  especially those between 60 and 70 years  with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  high cholesterol  and smoking history. Advanced age  male sex  and family history of heart disease further predispose him to this condition.   In summary  Mr. Donahue presents with symptoms highly suggestive of an aortic dissection  mandating immediate diagnostic confirmation and medical intervention. Since his clinical profile corresponds to the demography commonly associated with the condition  it emphasizes the need for vigilance and proactive management in similar patients to prevent catastrophic cardiovascular events. 
Aortic Dissection,1,31,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection   Patient Information: Mr. James Albert  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department complaining of acute  severe chest pain which he described as a 'tearing' sensation. The pain seemed to radiate to his back.  Past Medical History: Mr. Albert has been hypertensive for 20 years and lacks disciplined control of his blood pressure levels. He is also a former smoker  having quit two years ago  but smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for approximately 30 years. His records show a history of high cholesterol levels for which he had inconsistent medication adherence. Besides  he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery five years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He has been on regular follow-up for his heart condition  though with poor adherence to his lifestyle modifications. Mr. Albert also has a family history of heart disease with both parents dying of myocardial infarction in their early 70s. There is no history of connective tissue disorders or recent trauma reported.  Comment: The mentioned case presentation is consistent with literature on demographic representation in aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is more common amongst males  and African-Americans  specifically older adults (60-70 years)  have a higher prevalence. Hypertension is recognized as a primary risk factor for aortic dissection. In addition  Mr. Albert's history of smoking  elevated cholesterol levels  past heart surgery  as well as family history of heart problems further increase his risk. This case underscores the importance of risk factor control  regular follow-ups and a disciplined lifestyle in preventing serious complications like aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,32,Presentation of Patient:  Mr. Jacob Perez is a 68-years-old Hispanic male presenting in the emergency department with chest pain and upper back pain. The pain is described as severe  sharp  and radiates down to the back. The onset of pain was sudden  started about four hours back  and it has been persisting since then. The patient rates the pain as 10/10.   Past and Current Medical History:   Mr. Perez has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past ten years. He has not been compliant with his blood pressure medication. The patient has also been a smoker for about 40 years  consuming approximately a pack a day. No history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any confirmed coronary artery disease.  Family History:  There is no family history of any significant cardiovascular disease. His father died from lung cancer at 72  and his mother died at 78 from complications of Alzheimer's disease.   Lifestyle and Social Risk Factors:  Mr. Perez has a sedentary lifestyle and is retired. He lives with his wife  who has been taking care of him. He was an insurance executive before retiring. Mr. Perez is not overweight or obese  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 23.4. His diet mainly comprises home-cooked meals but acknowledges eating processed foods intermittently. He does not follow any regular exercise regimen. He admits to alcohol intake  typically consuming two to three standard drinks per occasion  3-4 times a week.   Upon examination  his blood pressure was found to be 178/94 mmHg in the right arm and 168/88 mmHg in the left arm. Heart rate was 112 beats per minute  regular but slightly labored breathing. Mr. Perez looks very anxious and in acute distress due to pain.  In conclusion  Mr. Perez’s clinical presentation and longstanding  poorly controlled hypertension suggest an aortic dissection which is a life-threatening condition therefore  urgent further diagnostic tests such as CT angiogram is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
Aortic Dissection,1,33,Subject: Brief Presentation of Patient With Aortic Dissection   Patient Profile: We present the case of Mr. William Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian man residing in Columbus  Ohio. The choice to take Mr. Smith as the patient under discussion aligns with prevailing demographic statistics that show aortic dissection occurring primarily among males and most commonly in the Caucasian population. Furthermore  the disease is reported to occur predominantly in the sixth or seventh decade of life.  Past Medical History: Before the recent manifestations of aortic dissection  Mr. Smith was known to have a past medical history marked by hypertension  which had been managed conservatively for around 15 years. Hypertension is known to be the most significant risk factor for aortic dissection  contributing to a reported 72–80% of cases. In addition  Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with atherosclerosis  another known risk factor. He was a smoker until the age of 45  quitting approximately 20 years ago.   Mr. Smith's family history is conspicuous for aortic diseases  with his father dying from aortic aneurysm at the age of 72. Genetic predisposition has been associated with in the development of aortic dissection  especially when combined with other risk factors like Mr. Smith's longstanding hypertension and atherosclerosis.  Overall  this case presentation underscores the typical demographic characteristics of patients with aortic dissections: older age  male sex  Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  atherosclerosis  smoking habits  and a family history of aortic disease. The patient's case is a reminder to us to maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients with similar backgrounds exhibiting concerning symptoms.   The preparedness to recognize and promptly treat aortic dissections can significantly improve patient survival rates  enhance the quality of life  and minimize the potential complications associated with this life-threatening condition.
Aortic Dissection,1,34,Title: A Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection   Patient Information: Jeffrey Tucker  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain. He is an executive in a multinational corporation and resides in Seattle  Washington. Mr. Tucker’s ethnicity and age are in line with demographic information indicating that aortic dissection is most prevalent among men in their 60s and 70s  and incidents are higher among White individuals. He is married with two children.   Past Medical History: The patient has an extensive medical history including chronic hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with antihypertensive medications. He was also diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 5 years ago  which is managed through a combination of statin therapy and diet. He has a 15-year history of cigarette smoking but quit 5 years ago. He is also a social drinker and enjoys a sedentary lifestyle.   Family History: Regarding his family medical history  his father suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his mother  at the age of 78  succumbed to a stroke. His younger brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his 50s.  Presentation: Mr. Tucker describes the chest pain as a tearing sensation  radiating to his back. The pain came on suddenly whilst he was in a meeting at work  and has been persistent over the last 3 hours. He also reports of feeling lightheaded. No signs of confusion  motor  or sensory deficits are notable at this time. His blood pressure is significantly elevated  particularly in his right arm  and his pulse is irregular.  These symptoms  in combination with Mr. Tucker’s age  sex  and particularly his history of hypertension  raise a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection. Immediate diagnostic and potentially surgical intervention will be crucial in managing Mr. Tucker’s case effectively.  In conclusion  the case revolves around Mr. Tucker  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  with a medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  presenting with symptoms indicative of aortic dissection. His demographics and lifestyle involve risk factors which are in line with literature-identified susceptibility for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,35,"Patient Presentation:  Good day everyone. I'd like to present to you a patient with an aortic dissection.  Mr. JB  a 67-year-old non-Hispanic White male presents to the emergency department. He is a retired mechanic with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking -- which he quit 15 years ago.   Mr. JB is complaining of a sudden tear-like pain in his chest that started about an hour ago while he was doing yard work. He describes the pain as the """"worst pain of his life """" and states that it seemed to radiate to his back and move down towards his abdomen  which is a classic feature of aortic dissection.  In addition to his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are common risk factors for aortic dissection  he also had a paternal uncle who had a history of aortic aneurysm. This family history also may have increased his risk of aortic disease.   Given his age  gender  and race  Mr. JB fits within the demographic profile most often affected by aortic dissection. Most aortic dissections occur in men  with studies showing that the majority of patients are over the age of 60  with a peak incidence in those 65–75 years old. Furthermore  the condition is more common in non-Hispanic Whites  who represent a significant majority of patients.  In conclusion  Mr. JB's combination of cardiovascular risk factors and family history has likely contributed to his current clinical syndrome of aortic dissection. Given his history and symptoms  he was immediately evaluated via diagnostic testing  including CT angiography. He has been transported to the cardiovascular surgery department for immediate surgical intervention. The early diagnosis and surgical intervention are key to improving his prognosis as aortic dissection is a life-threatening medical emergency.  Thank you."
Aortic Dissection,1,36,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith is a 66-year-old Caucasian male presenting with sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back  which he describes as tearing or ripping. He is a retired high school teacher and lives with his wife in a Manhattan suburb.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension  one of the leading risk factors for aortic dissection. Despite having been prescribed antihypertensive medication  he admits he often forgets to take them regularly or skips them due to occasional mild side effects. He also has a history of smoking  having quit 10 years ago. The patient reports a familial history of aortic disease  with his father having suffered fatal aortic dissection at the age of 70.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Smith is representative of the typical demographic for aortic dissection. According to the literature  Caucasian males  particularly those over the age of 60 with a history of hypertension  are at a higher risk for developing aortic dissection. Evidence also shows regional predispositions  with higher prevalence rates in the urban population as compared to rural ones  which could be possibly linked to lifestyle  stress level  and access to medical care.  Mr. Smith's history of smoking also places him in a higher risk category  as tobacco use can damage and weaken the arterial walls over time  contributing to conditions like aortic dissection. In addition  the reported familial history of aortic disease further increases this patient’s risk of aortic dissection  as several genetic syndromes and disorders such as Marfan Syndrome  Turner Syndrome or familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndrome are known to predispose individuals to this condition.
Aortic Dissection,1,37,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a 67 Year-old Male   Demographic Information:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who is retired. He is widowed  lives alone with some support from home health care  and regularly attends his local senior community classes. His BMI categorizes him as overweight but not obese.   Health Habits:  The patient is a former smoker  having quit 20 years prior  with a total 30-pack year smoking history. He drinks alcohol socially  limiting it to a rare occasions. He follows a typical Western diet and regularly takes walks for exercise.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history that includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are controlled with medication. He was previously diagnosed with coronary artery disease and successfully underwent angioplasty 8 years prior. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with lifestyle changes and metformin.  Presenting Signs & Symptoms: He presented to the Emergency Room with a chief complaint of sudden  severe chest pain described as ‘tearing’ running down to his back. He also complained of breathlessness and an overall sense of anxiety.  Evaluation & Analysis: His symptoms  combined with risk factors such as age  male gender  history of hypertension and smoking  pointed towards a possible aortic dissection. Results from subsequent imaging tests confirmed this diagnosis.  Aortic dissection is a relatively rare  but potentially fatal condition  affecting mainly older males  especially those with a history of hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. With rapid and appropriate intervention  the prognosis can significantly improve. The patient was immediately treated with blood pressure control and surgical consultation for potential intervention was made.  On Literature demographics: Studies show that aortic dissection is more prevalent in men than women and usually occurs in persons over the age of 60 years. The demographic details given are from the majority demographic suffering from aortic dissection  which is older Caucasian males. However  this condition can also affect other age groups and ethnicities.
Aortic Dissection,1,38,Introduction: We present a case of a patient identified as Mr. Luke Thompson  a 65-year-old African-American male who presented with acute onset of severe chest pain. Literature suggests that there's a gender disparity  with aortic dissection more common in males than females by a ratio of about 2:1 to 3:1  and it's furthermore associated with increasing age  predominantly among those aged 60-80 years. Mr. Thompson's location and race also match the prevalence rates  as the U.S.  particularly among African-Americans  shows higher incidence rates of aortic dissection.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Thompson arrived at our emergency department complaining of sudden  severe pain in his chest and back that started one hour ago. He described the pain as 'tearing' radiating from his chest to his back. He also presented with diaphoresis and reports light-headedness and fainting.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson's medical history indicated hypertension for 20 years  for which he is receiving treatment with antihypertensive medication. The critical connection between hypertension and aortic dissection is well-documented in literature  stating that high blood pressure can cause force against the artery walls  leading to an aortic dissection. Apart from hypertension  he also has a known history of smoking and a family history of aortic aneurysm.  Mr. Thompson had no previous history of any heart diseases  no diagnosis of Marfan syndrome  or any connective tissue disorder  which are also found to be risk factors for the aortic dissection. His past surgical history is non-significant.  Lifestyle: Mr. Thompson works as a taxi driver  leading mostly a sedentary lifestyle. He admitted to a history of tobacco use for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol occasionally.  Current Medications: Mr. Thompson is currently on Lisinopril  an antihypertensive medication.  In Conclusion: In summary  Mr. Thompson is a typical representation of the population most at risk for aortic dissection. His age  gender  race  history of hypertension  and tobacco use align with the demographic and risk factors acquired from literature. His presentation of acute chest pain and his past medical history were instrumental in suspecting and diagnosing an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,39,"Presentation Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction - Patient Introduction: Mr. James Johnson - Demographic Information: 65-year-old African-American male   Slide 2: History - Resides in Detroit  Michigan  USA - Retired automobile industry worker - Lives with his wife and has two adult children   Slide 3: Past Medical History - Hypertension: Diagnosed at 40  currently on Lisinopril - Hypercholesterolemia: Diagnosed at 45  currently on Atorvastatin - Coronary artery disease: Diagnosed at 60  had undergone stent placement  Slide 4: Habits and Lifestyle  - Smoking: 1-2 packs/day for the last 40 years - Alcohol: Occasional social drinker - Exercise: Sedentary lifestyle with low physical activity   Slide 5: Recent Clinical Presentation  - Presented to the emergency department with acute onset  severe chest pain radiating to his back. - Described the pain as """"tearing""""  Slide 6: Clinical Findings - Blood Pressure: 180/110 mmHg - Heart Rate: Regular  88 bpm - Distinct blood pressure difference between two arms - Decreased breath sounds at the left lung base  Slide 7: Imaging and Diagnosis  - CT scan of the chest: Showed an intimal flap and a false lumen  confirming the diagnosis of aortic dissection   Slide 8: Conclusion  - Mr. Johnson’s aortic dissection is likely associated with his chronic hypertension  smoking history  and previously diagnosed coronary artery disease. - This case demonstrates the importance of risk factor management in patients with cardiovascular disorders.   Slide 9: References and Source Material - Note: Aortic dissection is more common in males and among those of African American descent. The age group most affected is 60-70 years. Hypertension is the most common predisposing factor. Myocardial infarction  Marfan syndrome  and trauma are other risk factors. Smoking  high cholesterol  and high blood pressure can worsen the prognosis. Two-thirds of those with aortic dissection are hypertensive. The patient's CAD was a contributing factor in this case. In displacement of arteries or aortic insufficiency  a difference in blood pressure can be found between the two arms. The presentation of extreme pain is common. A radiating pain towards the back may indicate dissection. Diagnosis is usually by CT  MRI  or ultrasound. An intimal flap or a double lumen in the aorta is a defining feature of aortic dissections."
Aortic Dissection,1,40,Patient Presentation:   James  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the ER with sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain is sharp in quality and is different from any pain he has previously experienced. He describes the pain as continuous and more severe than any he's ever felt. He has a history of hypertension  for which he has prescribed medication  but admits that he doesn't always remember taking it.  James has a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit about six years ago. He has been diagnosed with high cholesterol and has been given a statin for the condition. His father had hypertension and his paternal grandfather died of a stroke. He has no known allergies.  On examination  he looks anxious and distressed with his pain. His blood pressure is significantly higher in his right arm compared to his left. His pulse is 97 beats per minute. He has a regular rhythm  but his breath sounds are decreased in his left lung.  The initial working diagnosis based on the history and clinical examination is a possible aortic dissection.  According to the National Institutes of Health  aortic dissection prevalence tends to be higher among men  individuals aged over 60 and the African American population  as represented by our patient. Risk factors such as hypertension  high cholesterol and a family history of cardiovascular diseases further increase the likelihood of this condition. Smoking history constitutes another major risk factor.
Aortic Dissection,1,41,Title: Aortic Dissection: An Overview of a Clinical Case  Patient Presentation:  We are presented with a 63-year-old Caucasian male  183 cm tall  weighing 80 kg  residing in an urban setting. He does not smoke nor drink alcohol. He leads a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity and a diet that is high in fat and sodium.   Past Medical History: He has a significant past medical history including uncontrolled hypertension for approximately 15 years  obesity  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. He has not been regular in his medical follow-ups and has poor medication adherence. He also had surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm 10 years ago. There is no known history of connective tissue disorders like Marfan's or Ehler's Danlos syndrome.  His medications include Amlodipine 10 mg daily  Losartan 50 mg twice daily  and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.  Current Presentation: He arrived at the emergency department accompanied by a relative with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back. The pain started while he was resting and rapidly intensified. He also reports associated shortness of breath and sweating. There is no history of loss of consciousness  stroke-like symptoms  or lower limb weakness or paralysis.  On physical examination  his blood pressure was significantly different between both arms (right = 200/110  left = 160/70)  and radial pulse was faint in the left arm. He appeared anxious and sweaty  with normal heart sounds on auscultation and no audible murmur.   Based on the patient's demographics  his past medical history  and his acute presentation  the possibility of an aortic dissection is highly suspected. An immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiogram has been performed  which shows signs suggestive of aortic dissection; this finding was subsequently confirmed by a computed tomography (CT) angiogram.  According to current literature  the major risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  advanced age  and male gender - all of which are present in this patient. This case adds to the increasing body of literature emphasizing the critical need for immediate evaluation and efficient management of this life-threatening condition.
Aortic Dissection,1,42,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 62-year-old male of Caucasian origin who came in complaining of severe  sudden-onset chest pain that he described as sharp and tearing  radiating to his back. The pain started approximately three hours prior to his arrival at the hospital. He also mentioned experiencing a slight shortness of breath. The patient's family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 58.   Demographic Information:  The patient works as a truck driver and is a long-term smoker with a history of 30 pack-years. His BMI is 29  indicating overweight  and he consumes alcohol socially. His socioeconomic status is middle-class and he lives with his wife.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension which was diagnosed about ten years ago and is poorly controlled at present. Despite several attempts to encourage compliance  he has been inconsistent with his anti-hypertensive medications. Additionally  the patient’s medical records indicate that he has high cholesterol and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents.  Representation in Literature:  The presentation is consistent with the demographic representation in literature. Aortic dissection is more common in males  especially those above 60 years with a history of hypertension. The patient's long-term smoking habit  poor control of hypertension  and presence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol significantly elevate his risk for aortic dissection.   In conclusion  this patient represents a typical at-risk population for aortic dissection  demonstrating key risk factors including advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  long term smoking  poorly managed hypertension  and a history of other cardiovascular disease. The sudden onset severe chest pain and back pain  coupled with his past medical history  strongly suspect a possible diagnosis of aortic dissection  which should be immediately investigated and confirmed for appropriate and swift treatment.
Aortic Dissection,1,43,Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Good Morning/Afternoon  Today I'll be presenting a patient facing a severe but uncommon medical condition - aortic dissection.  Demographics: The patient is Mr. Smith  a 62-year-old African American male  currently residing in Dallas  Texas. He is an engineer by profession and currently retired. Literature indicates that aortic dissection is most prevalent in males  ranging between the ages of 60 and 70  and a noticeably increased prevalence has been reported in African American population.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith came to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden onset of severe sharp  tearing chest pain. The pain reportedly radiated to his back  more specifically between the shoulder blades. He describes having shortness of breath and feeling faint. Upon physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different in both arms.  Past Medical History: On collecting his past medical history  Mr. Smith revealed that he has a long-standing history of high blood pressure  which literature suggests is a risk factor for aortic dissection. Also  he had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting five years ago. His family history is significant  with his father passing away from an aortic aneurism. He has a history of moderate regular alcohol consumption but denies tobacco use.  Given his clinical presentation and past medical history  a strong index of suspicion for aortic dissection was maintained  so we proceeded to conduct the Aortic dissection detection (ADD) risk score. He had a risk score which suggested the possibility of an imminent aortic dissection  and immediate interventions were sought to avoid further life-threatening complications.  Conclusion:  Early diagnosis and proper management of conditions like hypertension and diligent monitoring of patients in high-risk categories like our Mr. Smith need to be implemented. Preventative measures and early intervention can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality related to aortic dissection.  I will keep everyone updated as we continue through our investigative journey with Mr. Smith towards his way to recovery.
Aortic Dissection,1,44,Title: Clinical Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographic Information: Mr. Cooper is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who resides in the suburbs of New York City  United States. His occupations over the years have ranged from construction to administrative work. He is a lifelong smoker with an approximate 40 pack-year history.  Past Medical History: His medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia which were diagnosed 10 years ago. He has sporadic doctor visits and admits to irregular use of his prescribed medications due to cost-related issues. Detailed family history reveals no significant familial rotational abnormality debate  suggesting this as a possible sporadic rather than hereditary condition.  Presentation Mr. Cooper presents to the emergency department unconscious. His wife  who was accompanying him  reported that he suddenly collapsed after complaining of severe chest pain that radiated to his back. She indicated that the pain was tearing and came suddenly. There was no associated vomiting  but he did profusely sweat before collapsing. On arrival  his blood pressure is noted to be asymmetric  with pressure higher in the right arm than the left.  Given his presenting symptoms as well as his past medical history  the physician suspects aortic dissection. The sudden onset of severe pain and difference in blood pressure between the two arms are classic signs. His uncontrolled hypertension is a primary risk factor for aortic dissection.   Please note  aortic dissection is more common in males  and the average age at presentation is 63 years  as per the literature. Furthermore  up to 76% of individuals who experience aortic dissection are hypertensive. In the United States  Caucasians account for the majority of aortic dissection cases with smoking being a strong contributing risk factor.   This case underscores the importance of adequately controlling risk factors like hypertension  especially in middle-aged men  to prevent severe complications such as dissection.   Immediate imaging and further management will be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis and to prevent further complications such as cardiac tamponade  severe aortic regurgitation  or end-organ ischemia  which could be life-threatening.
Aortic Dissection,1,45,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Demographics:  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 62-year-old African American male who lives with his wife in an urban setting. He's a retired truck driver and has a history of smoking but quit five years ago. Although there's no family history of heart diseases  Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with hypertension for ten years that's inconsistently controlled.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith walked into the emergency department complaining of an acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. He described the pain as tearing and rated it as 10 on a scale of 10. Associated symptoms included dizziness  nausea  and shortness of breath. Mr. Smith did not complain of any symptoms such as cough  fever  or weight loss.  Past Medical History:  As mentioned earlier  Mr. Smith has been dealing with hypertension for ten years. He's been prescribed Lisinopril  but he admits to skipping doses occasionally due to cost concerns. He previously smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years but quit five years ago. He had one episode of chest pain two years ago  which was diagnosed as angina. At that time  his ECG was normal  and the coronary angiogram didn't reveal any significant obstruction.   Physical Exam:  Upon examination  Mr. Smith was alert but appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 180/120 mm Hg  pulse 96 beats per minute and irregular  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Upon auscultation  there was a faint early diastolic murmur heard along the left lower sternal border. Mild pedal edema was noticed bilaterally. Neurological examination was unremarkable.  Assessment:  The combination of his uncontrolled hypertension  history of smoking  and severe chest pain that radiates to the back raise the suspicion of an aortic dissection. Given how quickly aortic dissections can become life-threatening  immediate diagnostic procedures such as a CT angiogram of the aorta or a transesophageal echocardiogram has been recommended for Mr. Smith.  Patient/provider actions:  Instructions have been given to urgently start antihypertensive therapy  for lowering the blood pressure and heart rate and reduce the force of cardiac ejection. Based on the imaging results  a multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiology  cardiovascular surgery  and critical care will discuss the best course of action  which could include surgical repair  endovascular therapy  or medical management if stable. Interventions to address the issues around medication adherence have also been planned for the future.   Patient education:  Mr. Smith and his wife were educated about the seriousness of aortic dissection  the need for immediate intervention  and the critical importance of consistent management of hypertension. 
Aortic Dissection,1,46,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a Geriatric Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Mr. Thomas  an African-American male patient aged 70  presented with aortic dissection. Aortic dissection has a higher prevalence in men  particularly in their 6th and 7th decades  and effects are more severe in African American populations as reported commonly in medical literature.   Slide 2:  Presenting Symptoms Mr. Thomas arrived complaining of sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back. His pain was sharp  tearing  and interscapular at the time of onset  which is typical with aortic dissection characteristics.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Thomas has a history of hypertension  a significant predisposing risk factor for aortic dissection. Other history includes tobacco smoking for 35 years  another proven risk augmenting factor. No history of connective tissue disorders or familial aortic disorders which commonly predispose patients towards aortic dissection.  Slide 4: Additional Records Records also indicate the patient presented similar chest pain 2 years ago  and was released after treatment. At that time  no cause was pinpointed for the chest pain. It is now understood that undiagnosed aortic dissections may be associated with previous vague reports of chest pain.  Slide 5: Current Status Currently  Mr. Thomas is hemodynamically stable  which is crucial  as a high presenting blood pressure portends a poor prognosis. The patient will now undergo a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the dissection.   Slide 6: Conclusion The late presentation of symptoms  coupled with severe risk factors like long-term smoking and hypertension  highlight the need for urgent intervention to manage Mr. Thomas’s aortic dissection. The case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive patient history analysis in diagnosing complex conditions.   Slide 7:  Future Steps We suggest careful monitoring of Mr. Thomas post diagnosis  with comprehensive management of his hypertension  cessation of smoking  and potential surgical interventions depending on the type and extent of aortic dissection. Regular follow-ups are recommended for rigorous surveillance and possible detection of complications. 
Aortic Dissection,1,47,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Name: Anthony Sanchez Age: 63 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino Occupation: Career mechanic  The demographic correlates with medical literature as aortic dissection tends to occur more frequently in males  particularly in the age group of 60 and above  (Durko AP  et al. 2018). Additionally  Hispanic/Latinos are reported to have high risk for cardiovascular diseases (Sorlie PD  et al. 2014).    Slide 2: Past Medical History  • Hypertension for 8 years  erratic compliance with medication • Smoking  a pack daily  for about 20 years  currently cut back to half pack daily • Family history of cardiovascular disease - father died of myocardial infarction   Hypertension is a leading risk factor for aortic dissection (Evangelista A  et al. 2018). Additionally  Anthony's smoking habit is worrisome as tobacco usage is recognized as a contributory factor for aortic dissection (Wu J  et al. 2016). His family history of cardiovascular disease signifies a genetic predisposition to such conditions (Prakash SK  et al.2016).   Slide 3: Presenting Complaints and Symptoms  • Severe chest pain  sudden onset  • Pain described as sharp  'ripping' radiating to back • Shortness of breath • Weakness and fainting   Slide 4: Diagnostic Evaluation   Due to Anthony's sudden onset of severe chest pain  history of hypertension  and smoking  an urgent evaluation for possible aortic dissection is warranted. Potential diagnostic tests include laboratory assessments (D-dimer)  contrast-enhanced CT  echocardiography  and MRI.   Slide 5: Preceding Remarks   Early identification and aggressive management of aortic dissection remain critical to reducing high mortality and morbidity risks. Anthony's case underscores the importance of rigorous blood pressure control  smoking cessation  and regular cardiovascular check-ups in patient populations at risk.  Reference: 1) Durko AP  et al.

Aortic Dissection,1,48,"Title: Aortic Dissection Case Presentation  Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old African-American male  presents with sudden  severe  tearing chest pain. He is a retired maintenance engineer and lives with his wife. He has a history of hypertension  for which he has been taking antihypertensive medication inconsistently as a result of him expressing concerns about their side effects. Mr. Johnson is a former smoker  having quit 10 years back  but he admits to moderate alcohol consumption  averaging two beers a day. He is also overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29. Mr. Johnson's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father succumbing to a stroke and his elder brother having an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Johnson describes the pain as """"the most intense he has ever experienced """" and says it started suddenly while he was doing yard work. The “tearing” sensation was initially localized in the front of his chest but radiated to his back  particularly between his shoulder blades.  He additionally complains of shortness of breath and feeling lightheaded. He denies any incidence of trauma. His vital signs in the Emergency Room show that he is hypertensive  with a blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg  pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and terminal oxygen saturation of 91%.  Comments:  Demographically  our patient is at a higher risk for aortic dissection. Medically  he has a significant risk factor  which is hypertension. His ethnicity  gender  and age are in line with data showing that aortic dissections are most commonly seen in males  in individuals of African-American descent  and in those aged 60 to 70 years. His symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with the typical presentation of an aortic dissection. This condition requires immediate diagnosis and intervention to prevent severe complications  including death. Uncontrolled hypertension in patients such as Mr. Johnson increases the risk of developing an aortic dissection. Quitting smoking was a positive step for him  but moderating alcohol consumption and managing weight can further contribute to blood pressure control and overall heart health."
Aortic Dissection,1,49,Title: Aortic Dissection In A Middle-Aged Hypertensive African-American Male   Introduction:   Mr. D  a 53-year-old African-American male  was brought to the emergency department by his wife due to sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back  described as tearing in nature.  Demographic Information:  Mr. D was born in the U.S. and currently lives in a metropolitan area with his family. He works as a school teacher and has a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He is a non-smoker and non-alcohol drinker.   Medical History:  Mr. D has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  for which he has been irregular in taking his prescribed medication due to assumed side effects. He has no known allergies. There is no history of surgeries or family history of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore  he has no history of illicit drug use  traumatic injuries  or connective tissue disorders like Marfan Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.   Rationale:  Aortic dissection is more common in males and its incidence increases with age; common in those 60 to 80 years old. However  the presence of risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension can precipitate the condition in younger persons  as in the case of Mr. D who is only 53 years old. Distinctly  this is a rare but potentially fatal condition that often presents as severe chest pain.   African-Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension  which is a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. The prevalence of hypertension is approximately 40 percent in African-Americans  compared to about 28 percent in Caucasians. In addition  hypertension in African-Americans is typically more severe and less well-controlled.   Conclusion:  This case provokes a crucial awareness of aortic dissection  specifically among the African-American hypertensive population. Due to the lethal nature of this condition  prompt and accurate diagnosis followed by immediate treatment can avert the usual dire prognosis associated with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,50,"Title: Aortic Dissection Case Presentation  Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back. The patient rates his pain as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. He mentions the pain started an hour ago while he was at rest.  Demographics:  The patient is married and retired. He lives with his wife in a suburban home. He previously worked as a mechanic. He denies the use of any illicit substances  but has a 20 pack year smoking history. He quit smoking five years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and moderately.  Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a documented medical history of hypertension  which is poorly controlled due to non-compliance with his prescribed medications. He is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia with BMI of 28. He had an ischemic stroke three years ago  with left-sided residual weakness. However  he does not have diabetes mellitus or a family history of aortic dissection or connective tissue diseases.   Literature Data:   The demographic and clinical characteristics of Mr. Smith are consistent with those often seen in patients with aortic dissection. According to the literature  aortic dissection predominantly occurs in males aged 60 to 80 years. Risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  smoking  and atherosclerosis that are all present in this patient. This condition is also more common in Caucasians compared to those of African or Asian descent. Also  the patient's presenting symptoms align with the classic presentation of aortic dissection.  Conclusion:   Mr. Smith's demographic data  combined with his clinical presentation and medical history  strongly suggest an aortic dissection. Early identification and intervention are crucial as this is a life-threatening condition. His poorly controlled hypertension and prior smoking history may have contributed to the potential aortic dissection. This case underscores the importance of managing risk factors in high-risk populations to prevent serious complications like aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,1,51,Title: Case Presentation of the patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: Our patient is a male aged 63  self-identified as African American  and from an urban location. Retired from his profession as a construction worker  he is a current smoker for the last 35 years and has a known history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: He has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past decade. In addition to hypertension  he has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has taken medications sporadically due to financial constraints. Furthermore  he reported a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaints: He presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest and back pain that started a few hours ago. The pain was sharp  tearing in nature  and radiated to his back between the shoulder blades. He also felt light-headed  short of breath  and described feeling a fast and irregular heartbeat.  On Examination: On evaluation  his blood pressure was found to be high (170/98 mmHg) and the pulse rate was irregular. His physical exam was notable for the presence of a grade III/VI crescendo-decrescendo systolic heart murmur best heard in the right upper sternal border  suggestive of aortic regurgitation.  In this case  the patient's age  sex  race  and lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol use fall within the demographics commonly associated with aortic dissection  as reported in the literature. Furthermore  his notable medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  COPD  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases have possibly increased his risk for this life-threatening condition.  The severity and nature of his pain  coupled with the physical examination findings indicative of aortic insufficiency  make the suspicion for aortic dissection high in this case. This report highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with similar demographic risk factors  even in the presence of other potential causes of chest and back pain.
Aortic Dissection,1,52,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we are presenting the case of a 60-year-old African American male patient with a recently diagnosed aortic dissection.  Slide 2: Demographic Information  Our patient is a retired construction worker. He is married and is a father to three adult children. He lives in an urban setting with his wife  is a former long-term smoker and has a history of alcohol consumption.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  This patient has a documented medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which have been managed with medication. Additionally  the patient has a history of smoking for approximately 40 years  until quitting five years ago.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms   The patient initially presented to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as tearing and sharp. The patient also exhibited symptoms of diaphoresis and nausea.  Slide 5: Diagnosis  Due to the nature of his pain and his known cardiovascular risk factors (high blood pressure  high cholesterol  and smoking history)  an aortic dissection was suspected. This was confirmed using a computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  which showed a type A aortic dissection.  Slide 6: Risk Factors   Risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  male sex  age  and being a smoker. African Americans  especially those with untreated high blood pressure  are also at an increased risk. This aligns with our patient's demographic and medical history.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This presentation underscores the importance of prompt identification and management of aortic dissection  especially amongst high-risk populations. Taking into account the demographic aspects  such as race and age  and combining it with past medical history  like hypertension and smoking  can lead to a quick and accurate diagnosis. Further public health efforts should be aimed at managing these risk factors in at-risk populations.
Aortic Dissection,1,53,"Patient Presentation:  We are discussing a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension and a 30-pack year smoking history. He presents to the emergency department today with severe  sudden onset chest pain described as """"tearing"""" that radiated to his back.  Additional background information on the patient is as follows: he is a retired truck driver and has no family history of aortic diseases. However  his father had heart disease and his mother had hypertension and diabetes. The patient’s hypertension has been historically poorly controlled largely due to sporadic adherence to medications  coupled with limited regular follow-ups due to working long hours and limited access to healthcare facilities.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril for his hypertension  which he takes irregularly. He admits to not adhering to the prescribed low-sodium diet. He is a former heavy smoker but quit five years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally.  On examination  blood pressure readings are significantly asymmetrical between both upper limbs. There is a visible pulsating mass on his chest and abdomen. He looks anxious  sweaty and in considerable distress.  This case has typical features of an aortic dissection  a severe condition that occurs more commonly in men than women  and in patients in their sixties and seventies. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  age  and atherosclerosis. Higher incidence rates are found among African Americans compared to other races.  Our patient presents a high-risk case due to his poorly managed hypertension and smoking history. His symptoms  clinical signs  and background all illustrate the critical need for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management in patients suspected of an aortic dissection. Subscription to regular health check-ups and better vigilance in managing his hypertension could have reduced the risk of this serious and often fatal condition.   In summary  this case illustrates the vital importance of early identification  risk factor management  and prompt treatment of aortic dissection  particularly in high-risk populations like our patient."
Aortic Dissection,1,54,Presentation Title: Acute Case Analysis of Aortic Dissection  Introduction: The patient under review is a 65-year-old African-American male  Mr. Smith  who presented to the emergency department with severe back and chest pain which started suddenly a couple of hours prior to his visit. His pain was described as 'ripping' and eventually radiated to his lower back and abdomen.   Demographic Information:  Mr. Smith  a retired electrical engineer  hails from an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Tampa  Florida. He is a widower  living independently  with a daughter who stays nearby. He smokes cigars  a habit he has retained for the past 40 years. He consumes alcohol sparingly and has no history of drug addiction.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith suffers from a significant set of comorbidities including hypertension under medical control for 15 years and early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed two years ago  presumably due to his longstanding smoking habit. Mr. Smith had suffered an episode of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) 5 years before  without any permanent neurological deficit. He is a non-insulin dependent diabetic for the past 10 years. There is no known family history of any significant heart-related ailments.   Clinical Manifestations:  His vital signs upon arrival were indicative of severe distress  with high blood pressure readings of 210/120 mmHg  which is markedly increased as compared to his usual baseline. The physical examination found diaphoresis and an anxious patient. The cardiovascular examination revealed a discrepancy in upper limb blood pressure measurements and diminished lower extremity pulses.   The presentation of an older adult patient with high systemic blood pressure  the presence of long term comorbidities  and the sudden onset of severe chest and back pain is suggestive of aortic dissection  a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate attention.   Presenting Mr. Smith’s case provokes thoughtful insights into the complexities involved around diagnosing and managing an atypical presentation of aortic dissection in the backdrop of multifaceted aging and long-standing comorbidities.   The proposed presentation would continue to more illustrated facts such as symptomatic presentation  diagnostic investigations  and treatment strategies of Mr. Smith’s aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,1,55,"Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a Hypertensive Male Patient  Demographics: Mr. Robert is a 69-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the emergency department. He resides in Boston  Massachusetts  and is a retired engineer. He lives with his wife  and they have two adult children.  Presenting symptoms: Mr. Robert has come in complaining of sudden and extreme chest pain radiating to his back  which started a few hours ago. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and rates it a 10/10. He also reports feeling dizzy and short of breath.  Past medical history: Mr. Robert has a known history of chronic hypertension  which has been medically managed for the past 20 years. His blood pressure control has been moderate with occasional spikes. Additionally  he is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but smoked for 30 years. Mr. Robert has no history of diabetes and no preliminary diagnosis of any heart disease. He insists he's generally compliant with his medication but sometimes forgets.  Drug History: He is on Lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for his hypertension.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 64. His mother had hypertension and died from a stroke in her late eighties. His younger brother is also being treated for hypertension.  Analysis: Given his age  sex  history of chronic uncontrolled hypertension  long history of smoking  and family history of cardiovascular diseases  Mr. Robert fits the typical demographic profile and risk factors for aortic dissection. Immediate further evaluation and intervention should be undertaken due to the severity of symptoms and the potentially fatal outcome of aortic dissection.  Clinical studies have shown that aortic dissection is more common in men  predominantly in the 60s to 70s age range  with a history of hypertension and smoking being significant contributors to the risk. Caucasians are also more inclined to aortic dissection than African Americans.  References: 1. Tsai  T. T.  Nienaber  C. A.  & Eagle  K. A. (2005-08-01). Acute aortic syndromes.

Aortic Dissection,1,56,Title: Aortic Dissection in an Older Male Patient: A Case Presentation  Introduction: Mr. James Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with sudden  severe  sharp chest and back pain described as a ripping sensation. His pain started suddenly during his routine morning workout session. He has noted diaphoresis  mild nausea  and light-headiness. He denies any history of trauma. No family history of aortic disease or connective tissue disorders. Mr. Smith lives with his wife and is retired. He is a reformed smoker having quit 10 years back and does consume alcohol occasionally. He has no previous illicit drug use history.  Demographics and Epidemiology: Aortic dissection is predominantly a disease of older adults with a mean age of onset in the sixth to the seventh decades of life  and it is more prevalent amongst males. Racially  it is more common in individuals of Caucasian descent. As such  Mr. Smith's age and racial background make him a characteristic patient for this condition.  Past Medical History: In terms of past medical history  he has type II diabetes (on Metformin)  Hypertension (well controlled on Lisinopril and Amlodipine)  and Hyperlipidemia (on Atorvastatin). Regular follow-ups have been maintained for these chronic ailments. He has no prior history of major surgeries.   It is significant in the context of aortic dissection  as hypertension  in particular  is a major risk factor for aortic dissection. Type II diabetes and hyperlipidemia indirectly indicate endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease  which can contribute to the risk of aortic dissection. It is pertinent to mention here that Personal history of atherosclerosis  and previous cardiovascular surgery or procedures are other common risk factors  none of which Mr. Smith have.   Conclusion: In conclusion  Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  is presenting with symptoms highly suspicious of aortic dissection  an often life-threatening condition. His hypertension and age are particular risk factors for this potential diagnosis. More investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate suitable management options. His presentation underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and management of cardiovascular symptoms in at-risk populations. 
Aortic Dissection,1,57,"Title: Patient Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Introduction: Mr. Williams  a 64-year-old African American male  presents with acute severe chest pain. He reports a sudden onset  describing the sensation as a """"ripping"""" that started in his anterior chest before migrating to his back.  Patient History: Mr. Williams has a significant history of hypertension which he said has been inconsistively controlled over the years. He also has a strong cigarette smoking history  having smoked a pack a day for the past 40 years. Additionally  he has reported a 15-year history of hyperlipidemia. Though he hasn't had previous cardiovascular diseases  his older brother had an early heart attack at age 50.  Recent Progress: Over the past 3 hours  Mr. Williams’s chest pain has worsened in intensity. He has developed diaphoresis and complaints of feeling faint. He denies experiencing any cough  headache  or difficulty breathing. No visual disturbances  weakness  numbness  or speech problems are noted. However  his medical history and presenting symptoms raise strong concerns about an aortic dissection.  Investigation: 2014’s American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of patients with Aortic Dissection stresses the need for urgent diagnosis and management. With his symptoms and risk factors  it's essential to confirm this diagnosis with a CT angiography of his chest and abdomen.  Conclusion: As per literature  the risk of Aortic dissection is higher in males than in females with the average age at presentation being 63 years old. Hypertension is one of the primary known risk factors  increasing the patient’s susceptibility. Moreover  the patient’s history of tobacco misuse is also a predisposing factor. Consequently  while we need to further investigate Mr. Williams to confirm the diagnosis  a high index of suspicion has been raised.  Recommendation: Urgent management and consultation with cardiovascular surgery is necessary given his high-risk profile and the acuity of his symptoms. If confirmed  his prognosis will largely be determined by his surgical intervention and the extent and type of the dissection. Following intervention  aggressive management of his hypertension and smoking cessation will be paramount."
Aortic Dissection,1,58,Patient Presentation:   The patient under consideration is Mr. Smith  who is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The sudden onset of severe and tearing chest pain primarily drew his attention  which began approximately two hours before his arrival.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith's medical history reveals that he is previously diagnosed with long-standing hypertension  which has arguably been poorly controlled due to irregularity in taking his prescribed medications. Additionally  he is a heavy smoker and has been smoking 15-20 cigarettes per day for nearly 40 years. Mr. Smith also unfortunately has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  most specifically his father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. However  he has no known allergies.   Demographic Information:   Literature suggests that aortic dissection is more commonly found in males aged 60 to 70. This fact  along with his gender  age  medical history of hypertension and smoking habits  puts Mr. Smith in the high-risk category for suffering an aortic dissection.   It is noteworthy that genetics also possibly play a role in aortic dissection as literature has reported its increase in patients with familial history of the condition or associated connective tissue disorders. Though Mr. Smith doesn't have a reported family history of aortic dissection  his father's history of cardiovascular disease might imply an indirect risk and connectivity.   In light of Mr. Smith's symptoms and risk factors  aortic dissection is a significant consideration in the differential diagnosis. Therefore  an immediate diagnostic workup is initiated to confirm the diagnosis and to rapidly initiate proper treatment management.
Aortic Dissection,1,59,"Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Caucasian American Male Patient with History of Hypertension and Smoking  Patient's profile: Name: Patient X Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian American  Presentation: Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian American male with a history of hypertension and smoking. He presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  suggestive of aortic dissection. He complained of shortness of breath. On presentation  his blood pressure was found to be unbalanced on both arms.  Past medical history: 1. Patient X has been managing chronic hypertension for approximately 20 years  which he mentioned he doesn't always take his blood pressure medication on time. 2. He also has a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. 3. He does not have any known history of connective tissue disorders  heart surgeries  or recent trauma. He also denies any illicit drug use.  Demographic considerations: Aortic dissection has been shown by multiple studies to be most common in males aged 60 to 80 years old  with hypertension being a significant risk factor. Furthermore  a higher prevalence has been observed amongst the Caucasian population. Our patient falls within these demographic and risk profiles. Therefore  we should have a strong clinical suspicion of aortic dissection while considering other differential diagnoses.  In conclusion  aortic dissection is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. This is especially relevant in patients with high risk factors like hypertension  older age  smoking history  and male gender  all of which apply to our patient. Rapid diagnosis and intervention """"bridge"""" management is crucial  leveraging both medical and surgical solutions to reduce mortality where possible."
Aortic Dissection,1,60,Title: Patient Presentation - Aortic Dissection   Patient Profile: Mr. D.M is a 71-year-old retired African-American civil engineer  hailing from the South-Eastern Region of the United States. He’s been married for forty years and lives with his spouse.  Chief Complaint: The patient reports feeling a sudden severe stabbing pain in the chest that has migrated towards his back over the past several hours. He also reports feeling dizzy and lightheaded with episodes of shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mr. D.M has a history of two primary chronic illnesses which include uncontrolled hypertension for the last 20 years and hyperlipidemia for the last 10 years  both of which require daily medications. Furthermore  he has had a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for about 30 years  though he has been abstinent for the last five years. There is also a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including a brother who suffered from an aortic dissection.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared in moderate distress. His blood pressure was found to be extremely high  averaging around 210/120 mmHg  and had pulse asymmetry with decreased pulses in the right arm compared to the left. Intermittent harsh diastolic murmur was heard along the right sternal border. Neurologically  he appeared anxious  whereas his cognition and cranial nerves were intact despite reporting dizziness.  Investigations and Diagnosis: The clinical picture along with patient's history and physical examination highly suggests the need for immediate medical attention with an impression of Uncontrolled Hypertension and possible Aortic Dissection. To confirm  an immediate CT scan or MRI would be ordered for definitive diagnosis.   Social History: Aside from quitting smoking  he is modest in his alcohol intake  usually consuming an occasional beer during family dinners. He is not physically active and admits to struggling with dietary restrictions  often consuming foods high in salt and fat. The patient has Medicare and is up to date on his regular checkups.  This patient's presentation is fairly characteristic of aortic dissection  a condition more common in men  particularly African-American populations  with histories of hypertension  older age  and smoking. 
Aortic Dissection,1,61,"Title: Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection   Patient Information:  Mr. S.  a 69-year-old African-American male  comes to the hospital with a chief complaint of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. He is a retired IT manager  married  and has 2 adult children.   Past Medical History:  Mr. S reported a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 55  and aortosclerosis at age 65. He denies a family history of any cardiovascular diseases. He stopped smoking ten years ago after a 30-year pack history  and consumes alcohol only on social occasions. Mr. S is not physically active and follows a diet rich in processed sugars and fats. He is on medication for his diabetes and hypertension; however  his adherence to medication is inconsistent.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. S describes the chest pain as the """"worst pain he's ever experienced""""  rating it as 10 on a pain scale of 0 to 10. The pain started suddenly and has been constant ever since. He also reports shortness of breath and mild loss of consciousness.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  pulses in the right radial and left radial arteries are asymmetric. His blood pressure readings are significantly different on his right and left arms: 160/100 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg  respectively. Listening to the chest  a harsh systolic murmur is noted over the right second intercostal space  believed to be due to aortic regurgitation.  Based on the clinical symptoms  past medical history of hypertension and aortosclerosis  and physical examination  the working diagnosis of an aortic dissection is suspected. Immediate diagnostic tests including chest X-ray  ECG  and CT chest angiography have been ordered. Prompt diagnosis and management could be life-saving  considering the high mortality rate associated with this condition.   This case is a classic presentation of aortic dissection  which is more prevalent in males  predominant in the 6th to 8th decades of life. It's strongly associated with hypertension  atherosclerosis  smoking  and male sex  reflecting Mr. S's profile. Further management will depend on the classification of the aortic dissection and general patient status.

Aortic Dissection,1,62,"Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old Caucasian Male   Patient Identification: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  a retired software engineer  currently residing in Seattle  Washington. He is married with 3 adult children and 6 grandchildren.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiated to his back  described as """"tearing"""" in nature.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension and high cholesterol and has been on medication for the past 10 years. He does not have diabetes mellitus nor coronary heart disease. He underwent appendectomy in his 30s. He hasn't had any surgeries since then. The patient admits to being a former smoker  having quit 8 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and does not use recreational drugs.   Family History: The patient reports a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had a heart attack at the age of 64. His mother had a stroke at the age of 70. There is no known history of aortic dissection or any connective tissue disorders in the family.  Allergies: No known drug allergies. The patient is allergic to cats and experiences sneezing and itchy  watery eyes when exposed.  Review of Systems: Patient confirms associated symptoms  which include shortness of breath and faintness. He denies experiencing nausea  vomiting  paraplegia  or paralysis.   Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appears acutely distressed. Observations include blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg  heart rate is 105 beats/min  and he is afebrile. The chest is clear on auscultation  but heart sounds reveal a diastolic murmur. Neurological assessment is normal.  Summary: This patient's presentation of sudden  severe 'tearing' chest pain along with his medical history of poorly controlled hypertension puts him at a significant risk for aortic dissection. An urgent diagnostic evaluation should be deployed to confirm this diagnosis and initiate timely treatment.  Disclaimer: This hypothetical patient presentation is just a description and not an actual individual. This is also a simplified presentation – a real-life case of aortic dissection can be more complex and would require the attention of a medical professional."
Aortic Dissection,1,63,Title: Aortic Dissection in Elderly Patients  Patient Profile:  Mr. Smith  a 72 year-old African American male  presents to the emergency room with severe  sudden chest pain. He complains about the pain radiating to his back  similar to a 'ripping' sensation. A resident of an urban neighborhood in Chicago  Mr. Smith has been on previous medical consultations for his long-standing history of hypertension and atherosclerosis. He has a 20-year history of cigarette smoking but managed to quit 8 years ago. He also reports a high-sodium diet with limited physical activity.   Literature indicates that aortic dissections are most common in men between the ages of 60 to 80 years old and African Americans are reported to have higher rates of hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. Our patient demographic is congruent with these data.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has significant comorbidities  including coronary artery disease requiring stent placement 3 years ago  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his long history of smoking. He also suffers from obesity  with a BMI of 32.   Mr. Smith's medication list includes Aspirin  Metoprolol  Atorvastatin  Lisinopril  and Tiotropium for his COPD. Despite compliance with his anti-hypertensives  he still struggles to maintain optimal blood pressure control. His last recorded BP was 165/95 mm Hg in a recent primary care visit.  In conclusion  the patient’s age  gender  ethnicity  history of chronic hypertension  and significant past medical history increase his risk for aortic dissection. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing life-threatening outcomes in these scenarios. Understanding the correlation between demographic characteristics and such health-related setbacks could guide us in a more nuanced approach to patient care and preventative health check-ups in susceptible groups.  It is essential to educate hypertensive patients  including Mr. Smith  about the warning signs of aortic dissection and the importance of quick response to these signs  as urgent medical attention significantly increases the chances of survival.   Note to physicians: Kindly prioritize assessment of cardiovascular health in such risk groups. Regular cardiac evaluations  appropriate blood pressure control  and lifestyle changes can help prevent catastrophic events like an aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,1,64,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Patient Introduction Our patient is a 60-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been controlled with medication. He is a non-smoker  occasional drinker  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation as a long-haul truck driver.   Slide 2: Presenting Complaint Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe sharp and excruciating chest pain radiating to his back. He describes it as 'tearing' and 'ripping' in nature. The pain started while he was lifting a heavy object at home.   Slide 3: Pertinent Medical History Mr. Johnson has a 10-year history of hypertension and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago. Additionally  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 3 years ago. These conditions have been managed with Hydrochlorothiazide  Atorvastatin  and Metformin  respectively. There is no known history of Marfan syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve disease in the family.   Slide 4: Examination Findings On physical examination  Mr. Johnson appeared diaphoretic and in distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg and his heart rate was 102 beats per minute. He had a regular rhythm with no audible murmurs  clicks or rubs. Pulse exam showed no differences between the upper and lower extremities. His lungs were clear to auscultation.   Slide 5: Investigation Results An urgent CT angiography was performed  which demonstrated a dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending to the iliac arteries  suggestive of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Blood work showed elevated D-dimer levels. ECG and chest x-ray were normal.   Slide 6: Diagnosis & Management  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection  associated with poorly controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and physical exertion. He was initially managed with intravenous antihypertensive therapy to control his blood pressure and heart rate and then promptly referred for emergency surgical intervention in the form of ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement.   Slide 7: Patient Disposition Mr. Johnson successfully survived the surgery. He is currently in the cardiovascular intensive care unit  continuing with post-operative care management  including pain control  antiplatelet therapy  and tight control of his hypertension.   Slide 8: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection  especially in high-risk demographics such as African American men with poorly controlled hypertension. Prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention are crucial to patient survival. 
Aortic Dissection,1,65,Subject: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male. He lives in an urban area and works as an engineer  a job which involves significant levels of mental stress. He is a former smoker who quit approximately 10 years ago. He does not consume alcohol or engage in any illicit drug use. He attended university and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in civil engineering. His father passed away at the age of 60 due to a stroke  and his mother  aged 85  is alive and suffers from hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 15 years. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago but has been managed effectively with diet modification and statin therapy. His weight is within the normal range with a body mass index (BMI) of 24. He has no known allergies to medications.  His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed ten years ago. He has no history of significant infections or major hospital stays  and his immunizations are up-to-date. The patient does not have any history of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Psychiatrically  he has a history of generalized anxiety disorder  for which he sees a therapist bi-weekly and takes medication as needed.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented in the emergency department with a severe  tearing pain in his chest that radiates to his back. He describes the onset as sudden and as the worst pain he has ever experienced. He also reported associated symptoms of diaphoresis  nausea  and shortness of breath. There is no history of trauma to the chest.  Examination and clinical observations suggest the possibility of aortic dissection  and subsequent diagnostic imaging confirmed the condition. Given the patient's age  history of hypertension  and tobacco use  he is consistent with typical demographic characteristics and classic risk factors of individuals who develop aortic dissections  as noted in the professional literature. Notice will be taken to manage his condition-based and stress-induced anxiety during his treatment.
Aortic Dissection,1,66,"Title: A Case of Aortic Dissection in a Middle-aged White Male with a History of Hypertension   Patient Profile: Our patient  Mr. James  is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in the suburban areas of New York. He works as a high school teacher living with his wife and two children. A nonsmoker and social drinker  Mr. James' diet is somewhat high in saturated fat and cholesterol. He has been physically inactive for a few years now and admits to experiencing high levels of stress related to work.  Medical History: Mr. James was diagnosed with hypertension six years ago and has been on antihypertensive medications since then. His compliance with medication is fair  but his blood pressure control has been erratic  with recent readings as high as 160/110 mm Hg. Although he has no personal history of early heart disease  his father  also had hypertension and died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. James underwent a routine physical examination annually with no notable events until his recent episode.  Presenting Complaints and Symptoms: Two days ago  Mr. James started experiencing sudden severe chest pain that radiated to his back  between the shoulder blades. The character of the pain was """"tearing"""" and he rated it as 10 on the scale of pain intensity. He also reported mild shortness of breath  weakness  and lightheadedness but denied any form of lower extremity weakness or syncope. The pain did not improve over time and  concerned  his wife brought him to the ER.  These demographics  symptoms  and medical history are consistent with the typically presentation of aortic dissection  which is most prevalent in men  ages 50 to 70  who have a history of hypertension. It is crucical to note  aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate evaluation and intervention. In the case of Mr. James  his prognosis will largely depend on timely recognition of symptoms and immediate provision of appropriate therapeutic management.  The next steps would include an immediate diagnostic workup to confirm the suspected diagnosis."
Aortic Dissection,1,67,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jorge Garcia  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents today with sudden severe chest pain described as sharp or tearing  radiating to his back. He also reports shortness of breath  fatigue  and weakness. This patient was brought in by his son  who noted the dramatic change in his father's color and vital signs  as his father seemed notably paler and sweatier than usual.   Mr. Garcia resides in Tucson  Arizona with his wife of 40 years and has been a smoker for 50 years. He works as a construction laborer. His medical history is significant for hypertension which has sporadically been managed with medication but has been largely uncontrolled. Furthermore  he has a previous history of a transient ischemic attack around two years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Comment:   Hispanic men in middle to older age groups  like our patient  have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease presentations  in part due to cultural habits such as long-term smoking. Aortic dissection is rare but often fatal  with uncontrolled hypertension being the most common risk factor. Smoking can also contribute to the weakening of the aortic wall. Lifestyle  socioeconomic status  and access to healthcare have also been noted in various studies as contributing factors to the prevalence of aortic dissection in this demographic. It is important that Mr. Garcia receives immediate medical attention as aortic dissection is a medical emergency.
Aortic Dissection,1,68,"Title: Aortic Dissection in a 67-year-old Male  Good Morning   Today we will be discussing the case of Mr. Robert  a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with aortic dissection. He was brought to the ER with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  interpreted as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping """" and radiating to his back.   Mr. Robert has been a smoker for the past 35 years and is also a part-time alcoholic. These lifestyle habits have given rise to several comorbidities. He has a past history of high blood pressure that has been poorly managed and diagnosed with early-stage atherosclerosis three years ago. A family history of heart disease is evident  with his father passing from a myocardial infarction at the young age of 52.   Over the past year  he has complained of a persistent  unproductive cough and occasional shortness of breath. His physician has noted a high BMI  indicating obesity  adding to his cardiovascular risk factors. He also has a past history of uncontrolled diabetes for the past ten years.   Lab studies revealed elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and D-dimer  and his CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta and the arch.   Considering the risk factors for aortic dissection  like hypertension  tobacco  and alcohol abuse  it is critical to understand the patients' need for lifestyle modification and a practical  interdisciplinary approach to manage the case. We must take into account the presenting symptoms  the severity of aortic dissection  and Mr. Robert's overall health and comorbidities to provide the best possible treatment strategy.  Any queries or suggestions are welcome. Thank you."
Aortic Dissection,1,69,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Turner  a 65-year-old African-American male  is currently seeking treatment for severe chest pain. His past medical history includes moderately controlled hypertension and high cholesterol. His BMI is 26  indicating he is overweight. He smoked for twenty years  but quit ten years ago  and occasionally consumes alcoholic beverages. His diet is reported to be high in fats and sodium. Mr. Turner has not previously had any major surgeries or significant illnesses other than hypertension and high cholesterol. The patient's family history is significant for heart disease and strokes.   Patient is complaining of sudden  severe chest and back pain which he describes as tearing or ripping. The pain has been continuous for the past 3 hours. He also reports feeling short of breath and faint. Upon initial examination  notable findings are a difference in blood pressure between his right and left arms and a faint diastolic murmur detected during auscultation.   Based upon his presenting symptoms and the known prevalence of aortic dissection being highest among males aged 60-70  particularly those of African descent  with hypertension being a primary risk factor  aortic dissection is strongly suspected in this case.  In conclusion  Mr. Turner's case illustrates the standard demographic profile of many aortic dissection patients: male  aged above 60  African-American ethnicity  hypertensive  high cholesterol  and history of smoking. Studies show that the incidence of aortic dissection is twice as high in males as in females. The majority of cases (60%) occur in patients aged 60 to 70 years old. Hypertension remains a significant risk factor and is present in up to 75% of cases. African Americans have a higher incidence rate than other ethnic groups. As such  older African-American males  particularly those with a history of hypertension  are at higher risk for this life-threatening condition. 
Aortic Dissection,1,70,Patient Presentation:   I would like to present the case of a 65-year-old African American male patient  Mr. J  who presents with aortic dissection. African American males have been found to have a higher rate of aortic dissection  and incidence rates increase substantially with age particularly above 60 years.   Chief Complaint:   The patient came to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain that started a couple of hours ago. The pain is sharp  tearing in character  and radiates to his back.   Past Medical History:   Mr. J has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension  a known risk factor for aortic dissection  for which he has been under treatment for the past 15 years. However  Mr. J's blood pressure control has been erratic. He is also a smoker and has a history of high cholesterol levels  which add to his overall cardiovascular risk profile. He has no known allergies.  Review of Systems:  Upon questioning  he reveals symptoms of anxiety  shortness of breath  and a fainting episode before coming to the emergency department; these symptoms may be associated with the underlying disease. He denies symptoms from other systems  such as nausea  vomiting  or fever.   Conclusion:  This presentation is highly suggestive of aortic dissection  a serious and life-threatening condition. We have ordered a CT of the chest which is the diagnostic method of choice to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of dissection. The patient has been started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower the arterial blood pressure and pulse rate  the first line steps in managing such a patient  while the results of the CT scan are awaited.   This presentation aligns with the literature  as African American males above the age of 60 with a history of hypertension do show the highest rates of aortic dissection.   References: 1.

Aortic Dissection,1,71,Title: A Presentation on Aortic Dissection Patient   Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 65-year-old African American male  titled Mr. Smith  who is presenting with symptoms indicative of an aortic dissection. He works as a retired military officer  previously exposed to high-stress situations and currently lives alone following the demise of his wife 5 years ago.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has an established medical history of untreated hypertension and reports occasional tobacco use  both of which contribute significantly to the risk profile for aortic dissection. He also possesses a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father dying of a heart attack at the age of 67 and his elder brother having survived a stroke at 70.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Smith came in with a primary complaint of sudden severe chest pain  which he describes as tearing and radiates to his back. He also mentioned experiencing symptoms like shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and a feeling of impending doom. He reported no significant trauma history which could account for his symptoms. The absence of trauma  coupled with his medical history and classic presentation  makes aortic dissection a prime diagnostic possibility.   Epidemiological Context:  Epidemiologically  Mr. Smith is at increased risk for aortic dissection. While the average age of presentation for aortic dissection is typically reported to be around 60-70 years  literature acknowledges that African American males have been shown to be disproportionately affected by aortic dissection compared to other demographic cohorts. Untreated hypertension stands as a common predisposing factor  and his long-term tobacco use adds to his elevated risk profile.   The purpose of this detailed demographic representation and past medical history is to emphasize the importance of these factors while considering any possible intervention or treatment options.  Next Steps:  To confirm the diagnosis  recommended next steps include ordering relevant tests such as a CT angiogram or a transesophageal echocardiogram. Following confirmation of the diagnosis  appropriate intervention—either pharmacological or surgical—can be planned considering the demographic factors  medical history  and the current stability of the patient. Regular monitoring for complications and long-term management of his hypertension will also be necessary.  This case illustrates the importance of understanding the complicated interplay of race  age  gender  lifestyle choices  and comorbidities when diagnosing and managing acute conditions such as aortic dissections.
Aortic Dissection,1,72,"Title: Aortic Dissection in Middle-Aged Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction: Today  I present to you  a rare but serious condition known as aortic dissection. The patient is a 59-year-old African American male.   Slide 2: Demographics: According to a study by the National Institute of Health  aortic dissection occurs more frequently in males and is most common in the 60-70 age group. The racial prevalence skews towards the African American population.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints: The patient came to the ER complaining of sudden and severe chest pain which he described as """"tearing"""" that started between his shoulder blades and migrated anteriorly within the past few hours. He also reported shortness of breath and fainting.  Slide 4: Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of untreated hypertension. A study published in the Circulation Journal reports that hypertension is a risk factor in nearly 75% of aortic dissection cases. Additionally  he has been a chronic smoker  consuming one packet daily for the past 30 years. He denies any family history of cardiovascular disease.  Slide 5: Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared distressed and diaphoretic. Blood pressure was found to be asymmetrically high  with higher readings in the right arm. Upon auscultation  a diastolic murmur indicative of aortic insufficiency was heard.   Slide 6: Management & Prognosis: A CT Scan of the thorax confirmed the diagnosis of Type B aortic dissection. The patient was immediately managed with medication to lower the blood pressure and heart rate to reduce stress on the aorta. The long-term prognosis of aortic dissection is variable  depending upon the timely management and patient's overall health status.  (End)"
Aortic Dissection,1,73,"Title: Clinical Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Introduction:  Aortic dissection is a severe condition where a tear forms in the inner layer of the aorta  one of the body's main arteries. This tear disrupts the normal flow of blood and potentially leads to life-threatening complications. Today  I would like to present a typical case of aortic dissection.  Patient Presentation:   Patient Demographics: Mr. X is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe chest pain. He is a retired construction worker  originating from upstate New York  weighs 185 lbs and stands at 5'8"""".   Medical History: Mr. X has a long-standing history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the years. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus a decade ago and is under medication. In addition  he has a past medical history of tobacco use with a 30-pack year history. He has never been diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. X presents with sudden severe chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature. The pain began fairly abruptly while he was at home resting and has progressively intensified. The pain is retrosternal  radiates to his back  and is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. He also reported experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and had collapsed twice before being brought to the emergency department.   The clinical presentation  patient's demographics and risk factors such as age  gender  hypertension  tobacco use  and history of diabetes aligns with the typical patient profile of aortic dissection as demonstrated in primary medical and scientific literature. Aortic dissection tends to occur more frequently in men over 60 years of age  particularly if those men have hypertension  as is the case here.   Mr. X's clinical symptoms  with the severe chest pain that radiates to the back  is characteristic of aortic dissection  making it a critical condition to consider in his diagnosis. Immediate medical attention and treatment are required to prevent catastrophic outcomes  including death  associated with this condition.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering aortic dissection when an elderly patient  with a history of hypertension  presents with sudden severe chest pain. It highlights the significance of a well-taken history  emphasizing on cardiovascular risk factors  in the diagnostic process for acute aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,1,74,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 63-year-old African-American male  residing in an urban setting in the East Coast of United States  who has presented with symptoms suggestive of a cardiovascular abnormality. The patient expressed experiencing sudden  severe chest  back  and abdominal pain that has been persisting for the last few hours. The pain is described as tearing or ripping  starting in the chest and radiating down to the back. He also describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced. Additionally  he reports shortness of breath  sweating  nausea  and dizziness.   Medical History  On inquiry  our patient confirms a medical history of high blood pressure (hypertension) for which he has been on medication for the last ten years. Additionally  he has also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) for which he is on low-dose aspirin. The patient used to be a frequent tobacco smoker from his teenage years up till his late forties when he quit. However  he admits having resumed smoking a pack daily two years ago.   Family History  Our patient reveals a family history of heart disease. His father suffered from heart disease and passed away due to sudden cardiac arrest.   Lifestyle  The patient follows a sedentary lifestyle with poor dietary habits and minimal exercise. He admits his diet is predominantly high in saturated fats and sugar.  The preliminary diagnosis  considering the demographic  medical history  and presenting symptoms  indicates a potential aortic dissection. The patient's age  race  hypertension  cigarette smoking  atherosclerosis  and family history enhance his risk. Emergency investigations and rapid intervention is crucial in such suspected cases  given the high propensity for aortic rupture and life-threatening complications.  This case aligns with demographic studies describing aortic dissection patients as predominantly male  aged over 60  and of African American race. The patient's medical history is also consistent with commonly associated risk factors for aortic dissection  including hypertension  smoking  and a history of cardiovascular diseases.
Aortic Dissection,1,75,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  57-year-old African American male  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents with acute  severe interscapular chest pain which began a few hours ago. The pain initially was localized  but has since been moving downward along his back. He reported feeling a tearing sensation in his chest.   Demographics: African American males are two to three times more prone to aortic dissection compared to their Caucasian counterparts  particularly in their 50s to 60s. Being an African American male in his late 50s  this patient fits into the high-risk demographic group that is seen in the literature.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of systemic hypertension  which he has had for the past 10 years and is poorly controlled. He used to smoke  which he quit 5 years ago. His medical history also includes hyperlipidemia managed through diet and medication. Family history reveals that his father suffered a fatal aortic dissection at the age of 60.   Clinical Presentation: Vital signs contain a blood pressure of 180/110 mm Hg  pulse rate 96 beats per minute  respirations 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. His physical examination revealed a decreased pulse in the right lower extremity compared to the left. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally and heart sounds are regular without murmurs. There is no visible chest deformity or masses.  Summary:  Given the acute onset of a migrating tearing chest pain  history of hypertension  age  and demographic factors  the preliminary diagnosis for this patient is aortic dissection. Further diagnostic investigations  like CT angiography  are required for confirmation. 
Aortic Dissection,1,76,Title: Case Presentation of Patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographic Information:  The patient is a 69-year-old African American male  resident of urban Chicago  Illinois. He is a retired heavy machinery operator. His BMI is 28  indicating he is overweight. He is a long term smoker with a 45 pack-year smoking history. He lives with his spouse with 3 adult children who are actively supporting him.  Medical History:  The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years. He had poorly compliant with medication and is seldom engaged in regular follow-ups due to financial constraints and limited health literacy. He also has a five-year history of type II Diabetes Mellitus  under OHA medication. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction 3 years ago for which he underwent angioplasty  followed by medical therapy. He also suffers from moderate kidney disease. He does not have any known allergies.  Current Presentation:  He presented to the ER with an acute onset of tearing chest pain  radiating to the back. The pain was described as very sharp and more severe than any he had experienced before. The hypertension was poorly controlled with a BP reading of 170/105 mmHg. The clinical picture and history raised a high degree of suspicion for an aortic dissection.  A brief medical examination revealed unequal radial pulses and a murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. An immediate CT angiogram was done which confirmed Stanford type A aortic dissection.  This case takes into account various demographic factors attributed to aortic dissection; age  male gender  African American ethnicity  hypertensive and a smoker  as described in literature. This patient  with his medical history  falls into a high-risk group for aortic dissection. Early recognition and immediate intervention are key to reducing the risk of grave complications including death.
Aortic Dissection,1,77,"Slide 1: Introduction ----------- Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Slide 2: Patient Demographics ----------- - Patient's initials: J.S. - Age: 67-year-old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired Engineer    Research indicates that aortic dissection is more prevalent among older adults  especially men  and it seems to disproportionately affect the African American population.  Slide 3: Chief Complaint ----------- J.S. presents to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden  severe chest pain that began approximately one hour prior to arrival.  Slide 4: History of Present Illness ----------- The pain is described as """"tearing"""" and radiates to the back. He also reports feeling lightheaded and short of breath. No associated symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. No prior episodes of similar symptoms.

Slide 11: Discussion ----------- Despite being a relatively rare condition  aortic dissection is often deadly  especially without prompt diagnosis and treatment. It should always be considered as a diagnostic possibility in patients with chest pain  particularly those with a history of systemic hypertension."
Aortic Dissection,1,78,Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Hypertensive Male  Patient Identification: Mr. A  a 57-year-old African American male.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset severe tearing or ripping chest pain that radiates to the back.  History of Present Illness: The patient started experiencing pain early this morning  which heightened over the past few hours. The pain  originally localized to the chest  is now radiating to his back. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the chest. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and nausea. The patient reports no alleviating or aggravating factors to the pain. He hasn't experienced similar symptoms in the past.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a ten-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and he is a former smoker. No history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any respiratory diseases. No familial incidence of aortic diseases or aneurysms.  Social History: Mr. A is an electrician by trade. He stopped smoking two years ago but admits occasional alcohol use. He is married with three children  and lives with his wife and the youngest child.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient exhibited signs of distress and was diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg in the right arm and 160/90 mmHg in the left. The heart sounds were heard clearly with no murmur  but there was an apparent difference between the pulses in both arms.   Impression: Given the patient's history  the physical examination  and the extreme  sudden  tearing chest pain that radiates to the back  I suspect an acute aortic dissection. This is further affirmed by the patient's long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  which is known to predispose to the condition. I recommend immediate hospitalization and diagnostic imaging of the aorta with either a CT scan or MRI  followed by appropriate surgical or endovascular interventions as indicated.  Patient Education: Mr. A needs to be aware of the seriousness of his condition and the risks involved. He should also be educated about the importance of routine follow-ups and blood pressure management.   Disclaimer: The above case presentation is standard and does not apply to all individuals  as aortic dissection can present differently in each patient. The information here represents the demographic most likely to present with aortic dissection  according to existing literature and research.
Aortic Dissection,1,79,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 Years Old Sex: Male Race: African-American   Mr. John is an African-American male  aged 65 years  presently experiencing sudden severe chest pain  described as tearing  ripping  or shearing. The pain started in the anterior part of the chest and is now radiating to the back. In addition to this  he is experiencing shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mr. John has a history of hypertension for the last 15 years  which has been managed with medication. Unfortunately  he has poor adherence to his blood pressure controlling treatment regimen. Mr. John was previously a smoker but quit 5 years back. He is also a known case of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  diagnosed 10 years ago and managed with medication and lifestyle modification. Family history reveals that his father died of an aortic aneurysm at an age similar to Mr. John's current age.  Epidemiological studies show that aortic dissection is more common in males  particularly amongst those of African American descent. The peak incidence is in the 7th decade of life. Hypertension and smoking are major risk factors for the development of aortic dissection. Also  a family history of aortic aneurysm puts him in a high-risk group for aortic dissection. To confirm the diagnosis  relevant radiographic studies including a CT angiogram of the Thorax will be conducted.  This prompt discussion is one of relevance given that Mr. John's current presentation and past medical history suggest a possible aortic dissection  a condition which warrants immediate medical attention to avoid severe complications or even fatality. 
Aortic Dissection,1,80,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old Caucasian Male  Introduction: The patient in focus is Mr. John Albury  a 60-year-old Caucasian male of American nationality. He presently lives alone in Manhattan  New York  being a retired accountant. He was brought in to the Emergency Department complaining of severe sharp chest pain spreading to his back. The highlight of his case is a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a 30-year history of smoking  which are risk factors for cardiovascular pathology.  Detailed Patient History: Mr. Albury had been under regular medications for hypertension (metoprolol) and hypercholesterolemia (atorvastatin). Despite numerous recommendations from his primary care physician  he continued to smoke a pack of cigarettes daily. He has no history of diabetes  kidney disease  or any known drug allergies.  Present Complaint: The onset of the current severe chest pain occurred while he was sitting on his recliner watching television. He describes the pain as a tearing sensation  starting from his chest and radiating to his back. His discomfort was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin that he had previously been prescribed for his atypical chest pain.  Observation: On initial assessment  Mr. Albury looked apprehensive and pale. His blood pressure was elevated. A noticeable difference between the blood pressures in his right and left arms was observed  indicating possible aortic dissection. His pulse was noticeably irregular  and he showed signs of initial shock.  Conclusion: Given his demographics  including his age  gender  and Caucasian ethnicity  as well as his history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  Mr. Albury aligns with a typical high-risk profile for aortic dissection. Literature states that aortic dissection is most common in males and usually occurs in the sixth and seventh decades of life  with a higher prevalence in Caucasians. Hypertension and smoking significantly enhance the risk of developing this condition.  Moving forward  immediate diagnostic imaging  such as a CT angiogram  is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt medical or surgical intervention should be initiated upon confirmation. 
Aortic Dissection,1,81,"Title: A Case of Aortic Dissection in Elderly Male Patient  Patient Overview:   The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male presenting with severe chest discomfort. He is tall and has a thin built. He does not smoke and maintains a low-sodium  low-fat diet. He has a regular exercise routine but has complaints of sudden episodic pain in the chest area  which he described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping""""  radiating to his back.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a chronic history of hypertension which was diagnosed 20 years back. His blood pressure is not well controlled  which is one of the leading risk factors for aortic dissection. He has been on anti-hypertensive drugs  which is primarily a combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.   In addition to this  he has a familial history of connective tissue disorder  Marfan's Syndrome. Six-years ago  the patient was diagnosed with a mild form of Marfan Syndrome  characterized by a high-arched palate  tall stature  and an enlarged aortic root.  The patient has no history of any coronary artery disease  diabetes  or any other significant illnesses. He's had no surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. In his family history  it appears that his father died of aortic aneurysm at the age of 74.  Based on patient's age  ethnicity  and previous cardiovascular history  the suspicion of an aortic dissection is high. Literature suggests that males  especially African-Americans  of ages 60 to 80 are at an increased risk. Chronic hypertension  a high prevalence in African-American populations  is a significant risk factor  along with underlying genetic conditions like Marfan's Syndrome. Further confirmatory diagnostics like a CT scan will be carried out."
Aortic Dissection,1,82,"Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection   Patient Identification: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male named Mr. Washington. He resides in Detroit  Michigan and lives an active lifestyle through jogging and swimming. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with both his father and grandfather suffering from the same.  Past Medical History: Mr. Washington was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  which has been somewhat controlled with lifestyle changes and medication. He has also had occasional high cholesterol levels and undergoes yearly tests for the same. Apart from these ailments  Mr. Washington has never had any significant surgeries or severe illnesses and has been generally considered a physically fit and healthy man.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Washington presented himself to the emergency department today with acute chest pain  describing the pain as """"tearing"""" and as the most severe he has ever experienced. The pain appeared to radiate to his back between the shoulder blades and was accompanied by bouts of breathlessness. He noted that his pain started suddenly without any warning while he was out jogging.  Given his demographic profile and his description of his symptoms  a quick examination and a CT Scan was ordered. The radiology report confirmed the worst fears: a type A aortic dissection.  Studies show that African American men are one of the groups with the highest rates of hypertension  which is a risk factor for aortic dissection. Men are more likely than women to experience aortic dissection  and it most commonly occurs in people over 60 years old. This demographic information aligns with Mr. Washington's case.  It's also significant to note that this patient's lifestyle and habitual physical activities may have contributed to the condition  even if indirectly. Blunt chest trauma can result from vigorous and repetitive exercises  and can potentially initiate an aortic dissection  especially in those with a genetic predisposition.  Summary: Mr. Washington's case demonstrates that despite leading an active and seemingly healthier lifestyle  the risk of a severe cardiovascular event can remain high due to chronic conditions like hypertension and the presence of a family history of heart problems. Thus  underlining the importance of routine clinical assessments and vigilant monitoring of common cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk groups."
Aortic Dissection,1,83,"Patient Presentation  I am presenting a 67-year-old African-American male patient  identified as Mr. B. Mr. B is a retired truck driver  originally from Georgia. He came to our Emergency Department presenting with a sudden  severe pain in the middle and upper parts of his chest  radiating to his back. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" in nature. He mentioned that the pain was not related to his activities or meals.   Mr. B has a significant past medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels  both of which have been relatively well managed for the past 15 years with antihypertensive medication (Losartan Potassium) and a statin (Atorvastatin)  respectively. Additionally  he also has a history of tobacco use  with a 30 pack/year history but quit smoking 10 years ago. There is no known history of diabetes  or any familial cardiac issues.   In terms of lifestyle  Mr. B confesses to have a sedentary lifestyle  with poor dietary habits inclusive of high sodium and high cholesterol food items. His Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29.1 suggests obesity. He denies any intake of illicit drugs or excessive alcohol. Mr. B has no known drug allergies.  Considering the present symptoms and past medical history  the possibility of aortic dissection was considered  taking into account his age  race  male gender  and chronic hypertension  which are recognized high-risk factors for aortic dissection according to literature. A further diagnostic process with a CT scan was initiated to confirm the diagnosis.  In conclusion  Mr. B is a representative case for aortic dissection considering his demographic details and relevant risk factors. The patient's history and initial presentation are consistent with typical presentations for aortic dissection. Therefore this case exemplifies the importance of immediate recognition and treatment for such a life-threatening condition."
Aortic Dissection,1,84,“Good afternoon  I will be presenting Mr. Jose Santoro  a 63-year-old Hispanic male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  current smoker  and a past medical history of coronary artery disease with stent placement two years ago. He is obese with a BMI of 31 and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to desk-bound work.  Mr. Santoro arrived at the emergency department earlier today with severe  sudden onset of chest pain which he described as 'tearing' and 'ripping.' The pain is in the anterior region of the chest and radiates to his back. Accompanying symptoms include diaphoresis and difficulty breathing  but no associated nausea  vomiting  or dizziness was reported.   He recalls feeling unwell for the past few weeks  with occasional bouts of dizziness and fainting episodes  but he attributed these to work-related stress and did not seek medical attention.  On examination  we found his blood pressure reading to be significantly higher on his right arm compared to his left. His pulses were also diminished in his lower limbs suggesting vascular insufficiency. This wide pulse pressure differential is suggestive of a possible aortic pathology such as aortic dissection which is further supported by his presenting symptoms.   Given Mr. Santoro's high-risk profile- uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  coronary artery disease  and obesity- he has multiple risk factors that predispose him to aortic dissection. Among these  hypertension is especially significant as it accounts for approximately 75% of cases  while smoking  which is also quite prevalent in his population demographic  has been associated with not only dissection but also other atherosclerotic diseases.”  Therefore  immediate diagnostic imaging such as CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiogram is warranted to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment plans.
Aortic Dissection,1,85,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection   Demographics:  Patient is a 65-year-old African American male residing in a suburban neighborhood.   According to the literature  aortic dissection is more common among males and the risk increases with age (Crawford  2019). African American population is reported to have a higher incidence of aortic dissection (Howard et al.  2013).   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain is described as tearing or ripping in nature.  Past Medical History: Notably  our patient has a history of hypertension  which is the most common risk factor for aortic dissection (Crawford  2019). He is also diagnosed with Buerger's disease - a rare disease of arteries and veins in the arms and legs  which might have contributed to the overall vascular health decline. The patient has been a smoker for the past 40 years. No history of surgery or trauma.  Clinical Overview: On examination  there was a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms. Heart sounds were normal and there was no murmur. Distal pulses were decreased. These findings raised the suspicion of aortic dissection.   Considering the demographics  risk factors  clinical history and presentation  the patient was diagnosed with an aortic dissection and further confirmed through imaging modalities.

Aortic Dissection,1,86,Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 66 years Sex: Male Race: White Occupation: Retired construction worker   Presenting Problem:  Mr. Johnson presents to the emergency room with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back  particularly between his shoulder blades. He states the pain started when he was at rest and describes it as a tearing sensation. His vitals at arrival indicate a high blood pressure of 164/95mmHg with a pulse of 110 beats per minute. He appears to be in considerable distress.  Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension. He was diagnosed 15 years ago and has been inconsistent with his antihypertensive medication due to financial constraints. Seven years ago  he was a heavy smoker  consuming about a pack a day but he quit smoking when he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is also positive for hyperlipidemia. There is no family history of heart disease or aortic dissection.  Overview:  Aortic dissection is a potentially fatal condition predominantly affecting males more frequently than females  with the highest incidence occurring in 65-75 years old individuals. Mr. Johnson's age  gender  and history of long-term uncontrolled hypertension and smoking are potential contributing factors to his current clinical presentation. The severe chest pain he is experiencing  often described as tearing or ripping  is commonly associated with aortic dissection. His high blood pressure is also indicative of the potential for an aortic event  possibly due to increased stress on the vessel walls.  Initial Assessment:  Given Mr. Johnson’s presentation  a high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection is warranted. Immediate diagnostic investigations like transesophageal echocardiogram  CT angiography or MRI angiography will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team approach involving cardiology  radiology  and cardiothoracic surgery should be mobilized due to the potential complexity and acuity of his care needs.
Aortic Dissection,1,87,Slide 1: Introduction  We present the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male suffering from an aortic dissection. This demographic is consistent with the literature indicating that aortic dissection is more common in men  of older age  and often in the white population.  Slide 2: Demographics & Personal History  Our patient is a recently retired accountant  a father of three adult children  practicing regular exercise and has a history of smoking  but quit 20 years ago. With regard to lifestyle  he follows a diet high in sodium and fat.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  In line with relevant literature  our patient has a notable past medical history which includes a long-term history of hypertension  a major risk factor for aortic dissection. He also has a history of high cholesterol  which he has been managing with prescribed statins for over a decade. He has no history of diabetes nor any genetic diseases.  Slide 4: Recent Health Concerns  Over the last few months  our patient reported of experiencing intermittent chest pain  initially thought to be due to heartburn or indigestion. This has progressively worsened over time and  more recently  the patient experienced an abrupt onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back.   Slide 5: Presentation & Symptoms  The patient presented to us today with symptoms of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  pulse discrepancy and symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular collapse (fainting).   Slide 6: Summary  We have thus outlined the profile of a typical patient presenting with an aortic dissection  while highlighting the importance of considering this condition in patients with similar demographic and medical history. Accurate diagnostic tests and immediate medical intervention shall be pursued to improve patient's outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,1,88,Presentation Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in an Older Adult Population  I. Introduction   Good morning/afternoon/evening. Today  I am presenting a case of acute Aortic Dissection (AD). This condition  though rare  holds significant clinical importance due to its high mortality rate when left untreated. We'll look at the conventional presentation  diagnostics  and management strategies.  II. Case Presentation  Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in a suburban area in the Mid-Western region of the United States. This demographic is chosen based on research  indicating that most AD patients are men in their 60s to 70s. Additionally  aortic dissections are more prevalent in Caucasians than in other racial and ethnic groups.  III. Past Medical History  The patient has a significant medical history of hypertension for the past 20 years. There is a documented history of tobacco use  with the patient self-reporting 35 pack-years of smoking. He has experienced prior cardiovascular events including a myocardial infarction approximately three years ago  and also reports a family history of cardiovascular disease. His medications include amlodipine  metoprolol  and aspirin. He hasn’t previously had any surgical interventions.  IV. Presenting Complaints  The patient presented to the emergency department with an abrupt onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  predominantly between the shoulder blades. Additionally  he mentions experiencing shortness of breath.   V. Physical Examination  On examination  the patient appeared acutely distressed with visible diaphoresis. Notably  there was a difference in blood pressure readings between both arms. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs  and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   VI. Diagnosis   Considering the clinical history and presentation  the preliminary diagnosis is Acute Aortic Dissection. Further imminent examination and imaging studies  such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax and echocardiography  were done to confirm the diagnosis.    VII. Conclusion   This case presentation underscores the need for a prompt diagnosis of aortic dissection  considering the severity of the underlying pathology. Early recognition is key to managing patients and as clinicians  we must maintain a high index of suspicion  especially when treating older adults presenting with sudden severe chest or back pain.  Thank you for your attention. Any questions are welcome.
Aortic Dissection,1,89,"Title: Presentation of a Case of Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. Joseph Brown  a 65-year-old African-American male  retired plumber who lives with his wife in an urban neighborhood  presents to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Brown reports severe and sudden chest pain which he describes as """"a tearing sensation"""" that started about 2 hours ago while watching T.V. at home.  Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of hypertension being managed with antihypertensive drugs for the past 10 years. He also had a smoking history of about 20 pack years and quit smoking 5 years ago. He has no known allergies.  Physical Examination: On examination  his blood pressure shows a significant difference between the right and left upper extremities. His heart rate is elevated with a slightly reduced pulse pressure and the breath sounds reduced on the left side. His BMI is 29  indicating he is overweight.  Pathophysiology:  In Mr. Brown's case  uncontrolled hypertension seems to be the primary predisposing factor for the development of aortic dissection. The constant stress on the arterial walls from high blood pressure weakens it over time. Age-related changes and the possible contribution of smoking may have exacerbated the arterial wall stress.  Demographics and Aortic Dissection Relations: Aortic dissection is more common in males and incidence rises significantly after the age of 60. Hypertension is present in the majority (approximately 72%) of patients with aortic dissection. African Americans have been found to have a higher risk of aortic dissections compared to other racial groups. Smoking  which is a risk factor  was also present in this patient's history.   To summarize  our patient fits the commonly seen demographic and clinical profile for aortic dissection  which includes being an older male  being of African-American descent  a history of hypertension  and a history of smoking.

Past Medical History: Mr. Williams has a complicated medical history. He was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago and has been managing it with medication since then. Mr. Williams was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 10 years ago. Despite these  he has not been fully compliant with his medications leading to suboptimal control of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  He has a known history of smoking for the past 50 years  consuming about a pack of cigarettes each day  however  he quit smoking 2 years ago. He has no known history of diabetes  stroke  or any other cardiovascular disease. There's no family history of any genetic connective tissue diseases.  Presentation: Mr. Williams came to the ER in the early hours of this morning  describing a sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and states it began at rest. He rates his pain as a 10 out of 10. His onset of pain was sudden. He had been fine when he went to bed  only to be awakened at around 1am by the intense pain. However  he does not report any associated symptoms like fainting  palpitations  shortness of breath  or sweating.   Current Condition: Currently  he is experiencing continuous pain  despite taking his usual analgesics. Blood pressure readings reveal high systemic hypertension. His pulse is regular but slightly elevated due to pain and anxiety. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in heart sounds.   Conclusion: Keeping in view his age  his pathological history particularly of hypertension and smoking  together with the severe onset 'tearing' chest pain  the possible diagnosis of aortic dissection is suggested. Further diagnostic tests  including a chest X-ray  EKG  and CT angiography will be pursued to confirm this.  The above presentation reflects the fact that aortic dissections are more common in males  people aged 60-80  those with a history of hypertension  and among African American ethnicity  as supported by the literature."
Aortic Dissection,1,91,Title: A Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection: A 65-Year-Old Male Patient  Introduction: We're discussing the case of a 65-year-old African American male  who primarily speaks English and is a retired construction worker. His initial presentation to the emergency department was prompted by sudden onset  severe chest pain that radiated to his back. He reports a history of poorly controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-year history of smoking  which he quit five years ago. The patient of late has limited access to healthcare due to financial instability. There is no family history of cardiovascular disease.   Demographics: Our patient belongs to the demographic group commonly associated with aortic dissection. The incidence rates are higher in males and the individuals over 60. Furthermore  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  all prevalent in his history  are well-established risk factors for the development of aortic dissection. Also  racial disparities exist in hypertension-related complications  with African Americans being disproportionately affected.  Past Medical History: When questioned further  he described his chest pain as 'tearing' and 'agonizing.' The patient's blood pressure readings have been consistently above the range of 140/90 mm Hg on several past primary care visits. His hyperlipidemia has not been effectively managed due to discontinuation of statin therapy against medical advice. Although he quit smoking about five years ago  he has a 20-pack-year history of smoking.  Evaluation: Physical examination revealed an elevated blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg in the right arm and 145/90 mm Hg in the left. His cardiovascular examination was significant for a discrepancy in pulse delay between the upper and lower extremities  which is a commonly observed physical sign in patients with aortic dissection. Laboratory tests showed elevated D-dimers  and Chest CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection.  Conclusion: Our patient represents a demographic with multiple stepped-up risks for aortic dissection – namely age  gender  race  and longstanding poorly controlled risk factors for cardiovascular disease. His presenting symptoms and signs  coupled with confirmatory radiologic evidence  led to the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Prompt surgical intervention is planned for this patient  emphasizing the pressing need for aggressive risk management strategies in such high-risk  representative groups.
Aortic Dissection,1,92,"Patient Presentation:  Title: A 66-year-old African American male with a history of untreated hypertension presenting with acute aortic dissection.  Introduction:  Mr. Johnson  a 66-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  radiating to the back  which commenced less than an hour ago. He is a lifetime resident of the Baltimore area and is retired from a career as a construction worker. He has a history of chronic untreated hypertension and smoking for 40 years  although he quit five years ago.   Clinical History:  Mr. Johnson's personal medical history is unique in terms of having untreated hypertension for over a decade  with periodic readings often in the 160/90 range. Despite his awareness of this condition  he has declined treatment multiple times due to a general distrust of the healthcare system. Additionally  he has an unverified history of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm in his maternal lineage  with no known Marfan Syndrome cases. He has not undergone any previous surgeries and has no known allergies. His social history is otherwise unremarkable  apart from a significant 40-year smoking history.  Clinical Presentation:  Today  Mr. Johnson exhibits signs of acute distress  describing his current pain as severe and sharp  a """"ripping"""" sensation  conspicuously different from any pain he's experienced before  even comparing it to the pain caused by kidney stones. Moreover  he is also experiencing moderate dyspnea and minor dizziness but denies any associated nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or loss of consciousness.  In terms of demographic data regarding aortic dissection in literature  it's noteworthy that this condition is more prevalent in males (especially between ages 60 and 70) and is substantially common in people with a history of hypertension. African American ethnicity  while not typically considered a major risk factor for aortic dissection  has been associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension  which indirectly increases the risk of an aortic dissection. Other habits like smoking  presenting in Mr. Johnson's case  also increase the risk of developing aortic dissection.  Conclusion:  In summary  Mr. Johnson  a 66-year-old African American male known for untreated severe hypertension and extended smoking history  currently presents with symptoms and risk factors highly suggestive of an acute aortic dissection. A prompt diagnostic evaluation and management plan are critical at this stage."
Aortic Dissection,1,93,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a 68-year-old Male with a History of Hypertension  Patient Profile: Mr. John Palmer is a retired  68-year-old Caucasian man currently residing in the suburbs of North Carolina  USA. He has a prolific history of uncontrolled hypertension  dating back at least 20 years. He also has a history of tobacco use  having smoked a pack a day for approximately 25 years  but quit about 8 years ago.   Clinical Presentation: Mr. Palmer reports experiencing a sudden onset of severe and sharp tearing pain in his chest radiating to his back  which occurred while he was gardening. The severity of the pain led him to stop his activity and immediately seek help.   Past Medical History: Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 48. Despite prescribed antihypertensive medications  he has been inconsistent in their usage and his blood pressure has remained poorly controlled. In addition  he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) likely related to his history of smoking. Despite quitting smoking over a decade ago  Mr. Palmer has noticed a gradual deterioration of his respiratory function  which has been managed with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Apart from these  he has no known allergies.   Family History: His father had a history of ischemic heart disease and died at the age of 55 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother died at age 80 due to complication of stroke. He has two siblings who are alive and well  both diagnosed with hypertension.   Social History: Mr. Palmer has been retired for eight years from his job as a construction foreman. He lives with his wife and their dog. He denies the use of alcohol or illicit drug. He is socially active in his neighborhood organizing various community events. He enjoys gardening and reading in his free time.   The aforementioned picture paints the clinical portrait of a typical patient at risk for aortic dissection  which is most common in men ages 60 to 70  in addition to pre-existing hypertension  a significant risk factor. Aortic dissection remains highly associated with a history of smoking  despite cessation. It reflects the global and regional demographic characteristics for such presentations.
Aortic Dissection,1,94,"Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old African American Male  Patient Profile: Mr. Brown is a 60-year-old African American male  coming in with complaints of sudden  severe chest pain.  Presenting Complaint: He describes his pain as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back  starting approximately 2 hours ago. He has never experienced such a feeling before  rating the pain a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago and has struggled to manage it consistently due to financial and environmental constraints. Low adherence to prescribed medication is a recurring issue.   Risk Factors:  His medical history shows essential hypertension  untreated high cholesterol  and a 20-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day  which he quit five years ago. His family history suggests a propensity for cardiovascular diseases: his father died of stroke at 68  and his older brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery nine years ago. Unfortunately  he has been largely sedentary throughout his life  which along with his unhealthy diet  makes him slightly obese (BMI 30.5 kg/m2).  Demographic Representations: The demographic details presented here regarding aortic dissection are accurate with respect to existing medical literature. Aortic dissections are more common in men  with an average age at presentation of 63 years  slightly older than Mr. Brown is. African Americans  in particular  have a higher risk of aortic dissection partly due to higher rates of poorly controlled hypertension.   Also  poor control of hypertension is common in this demographic group. Prevalence of smoking  which is a risk factor for aortic dissection  is close to 20% among African American men. Thus  Mr Brown's history of smoking further increases his risk alongside his hypertension and cholesterol issues.  Conclusion: The patient's symptoms  demographic factors  lifestyle choices  and nascent medical history collectively suggest a high possibility of aortic dissection. Therefore  immediate diagnostic evaluation and potential intervention are highly recommended."
Aortic Dissection,1,95,Title: A Case Study Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Presenting Patient: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male standing 5'9 tall  weighing 95 kg  presenting with a chief complaint of sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back which began whilst he was asleep in the early hours of the morning. The patient further describes the pain as “tearing” in nature. No prior incidence of such occurrence has been reported by the patient. He's a retired mechanical engineer  moderate smoker (20 cigarettes a day for the past 35 years)  and a social drinker. He lives with his wife in the suburbs and is fairly active community member.  Demographic Information: As per the demographic data  aortic dissection is more common in males and the patient's age sits within the typical age range of 60-70 years old for aortic dissection. Furthermore  being Caucasian he represents the highest incidences of aortic dissection as per several studies and literature.   Past Medical History: On further inquiry  the patient divulges a known diagnosis of hypertension for the past 15 years  managed with regular antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide). Additionally  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for the last 5 years  which is well-controlled on Metformin. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father dying from a stroke at age 68. The patient is also moderately obese  with a body mass index of 30.8  and has a past history of high cholesterol  managed with statins (Atorvastatin).   In conclusion  the patient's medical history of long-standing hypertension  being a smoker  as well as his family history of cardiovascular diseases  might have increased his risk factors for aortic dissection. His presentation is consistent with the symptoms commonly reported in literature for this condition. As next steps  additional diagnostic tests  such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)  will need to be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,1,96,Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Thompson  a 62-year-old African American male from Boston  Massachusetts  arrived in the emergency room reporting a sudden onset of severe chest pain. The pain began while he was at rest  and he described it as 'tearing' and 'ripping' in nature  radiating towards his back. Mr. Thompson also reported associated symptoms of fainting and shortness of breath. He further mentioned that the pain is unlike any he has experienced before  stating its intensity was 'off the charts.'   Medical and Social History:   Mr. Thompson has a known medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 15 years. He was prescribed medication for hypertension management but had been non-compliant with his medication regimen. Mr. Thompson is a smoker with a 30-pack-year history and admits to habitual heavy alcohol use. He has no family history of cardiovascular diseases. He works as a construction laborer. He has no known drug allergies.   Racial/Ethnic Considerations:   The incidence of aortic dissection is higher in males and African American individuals. African Americans have higher rates of hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  which might contribute to the demographic representation.  Conclusion:   In summary  Mr. Thompson's demographic characteristics  medical history  and his presenting symptoms align with the clinical picture of an aortic dissection. Immediate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be implemented according to established guidelines to manage the potentially fatal condition.  References:  * Braverman  A. C. (2010).

Aortic Dissection,1,97,"Title: Presentation of an Aortic Dissection Patient  Patient Profile: Patient is Mr. John Rivera  a 65-year-old African American male. He currently resides in Chicago  Illinois. Mr. Rivera is retired  formerly serving in the U.S. Army  and is currently living with his wife. His familial history reveals that both his father and older brother had experienced heart disease.   Past Medical History: Mr. Rivera has a complex medical history. He was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago  which remains only slightly controlled despite antihypertensive therapy. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but has a total pack history of 30 years. He has been diagnosed with high cholesterol and is being managed on statins. There is no report of diabetes  renal disease  or respiratory disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery ten years ago due to significant coronary artery disease.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Rivera arrived at the emergency room and reported severe chest and back pain  especially between the shoulder blades  which he described as """"ripping"""" in nature. The pain was sudden in onset and has persisted for a couple of hours. He also noted some associated shortness of breath  but there is no report of other symptoms like fainting  dizziness  or weakness.  On examination: Mr. Rivera appeared distressed due to pain. His blood pressure shows significant differences between the two upper limbs  suggesting a vascular abnormality. Auscultation of the chest shows a murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency. His pulses were asymmetric.  Aortic dissection was suspected due to the unique features of the presenting symptoms and past medical history. This suspicion was later confirmed through a CT angiogram. The patient was admitted to the ICU for urgent surgical intervention.  This case highlights the significant risk and prevalence of aortic dissection among elderly  hypertensive males  especially those with a history of smoking and coronary artery disease  as supported by literature."
Aortic Dissection,1,98,"Patient Presentation:  John Doe is a 62-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe pain in his chest and back.   Medical History:  Mr. Doe is a former smoker with a 10-pack year record  quitting about 15 years ago. He has a known medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which have been partially controlled with medication. There is no diabetes  COPD  or other cardiovascular or lung diseases present.   There is also a family history of potential note  as his father suffered from an aortic aneurysm.   Presentation & Symptoms:  Mr. Doe described the pain as """"ripping"""" or """"tearing""""  a characteristic description often linked to aortic dissection. It started in his chest and has been rapidly progressing towards the back. He reports no radiation to the neck or arms but states that the pain seems to move in sync with his heartbeat. Symptoms intensified within a few hours following initial onset  prompting his visit to the ER.   Along with his pain  Mr. Doe also reported feeling faint and experiencing shortness of breath. Interestingly  he states that his blood pressure has been abnormally high lately  despite adherence to his antihypertensive regimen.   Mr. Doe's age  gender  history of hypertension  smoking  and family history of aortic disease  along with his presenting symptoms  align with the demographic most commonly associated with aortic dissection  which are Caucasian males in their 60s. A high index of suspicion is critical because quick diagnosis and treatment are paramount in managing this life-threatening condition. We ordered immediate diagnostic tests  including a CT scan and D-Dimer  to confirm the diagnosis and plan subsequent management.   In the future  Mr. Doe could potentially benefit from smoking cessation programs and lifestyle changes to decrease hypertension and improve his overall cardiovascular health. He should also familiarize himself with the symptoms of aortic dissection  given his increased risk  and seek immediate medical attention should these symptoms present."
Aortic Dissection,1,99,Patient Presentation:  We will discuss Mr. J  a 65-year- old African American male presenting with symptoms consistent with an aortic dissection. Mr. J hails from Chicago  Illinois and is married with three adult children. He is a retired mechanical engineer and his wife is a school teacher.   Mr. J has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which he was diagnosed with when he was 36 years old  working in a high-stress job with long working hours. He has been on antihypertensive therapy since his diagnoses and his blood pressure has usually been under good control. Additionally  he was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia ten years ago and is on statin therapy. He does not have diabetes or any kidney disease. He has no known drug allergies  and he has never been a smoker. He does not have any family history of aortic dissection or connective tissue diseases. His father had a heart attack and his mother had a stroke.  Today  he was brought into the emergency department by his wife  complaining of sudden severe chest pain. The pain began while he was eating dinner  described as tearing and radiating to his back. He also reported feeling clammy and sweaty  experiencing shortness of breath  and feeling generally unwell.  Aortic dissection disproportionately affects males  and African-Americans are at slightly higher risk than other racial or ethnic groups. Additionally  hypertension  which affects African-Americans at higher rates than other racial/ethnic groups  is a leading risk factor for aortic dissection. Age  one of the strongest risk factors for aortic dissection  with most cases occurring in individuals between 50-80 years old. Hence  a 65-year-old hypertensive African-American male is representative of a population at risk for this condition.   A prompt diagnosis and management plan for Mr. J's aortic dissection will be instituted  keeping in mind his age  race  and medical history to provide an optimal patient-driven approach.
Aortic Dissection,1,100,Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  Patient Overview:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male presenting in the ER with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is described as 'tearing' in nature. The patient reports that symptoms initiated while he was at home  and progressively became intense over a span of several hours.   Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last ten years and a smoking habit of 20 years. He has also been on medication for high cholesterol for the past five years. His father and uncle both died of heart diseases in their late 60s. The patient does not have a history of any surgeries  and denies any allergies to food or medication. He lives with his wife in the city  is retired  and has a social history of moderate alcohol drinking.  Literature Basis:  According to existing literature  the occurrence of aortic dissection is more commonly observed in men  and with the patient's age  being over 60  he falls in the high-risk group. Additionally  hypertension is a significant risk factor  prevalent in 75% of cases. His history of smoking and high cholesterol also facilitates atherosclerosis  thus increasing the risk of aortic dissection. Furthermore  the African American population is shown to have higher rates of hypertension compared with other racial and ethnic groups  emphasizing his risk.  Image and Diagnosis:  Imaging  CT angiography  in particular  confirms a diagnosis of an aortic dissection  showing a tear in the intima of the aorta and a dissection flap.  In conclusion:  This patient's demographic and medical history put him at high risk for the development of aortic dissection. Next steps would include immediate surgical consultation and initiation of blood pressure control therapy. Education regarding the importance of strict blood pressure and cholesterol control  cessation of smoking  and limiting alcohol intake would be crucial in management and prevention of future cardiovascular incidents.
Aortic Dissection,2,1,Patient Presentation: A 62-year-old African American male patient with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and smoking presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of intense  tearing  interscapular pain radiating to the back along with shortness of breath. He describes the pain as extremely sharp and severe and informs that it began abruptly a few hours ago. He also complains of diaphoresis and mild dizziness. There is no loss of consciousness  no nausea  vomiting  or abdominal pain but he has increasingly become anxious due to the intense pain.  His past medical history is significant for long-term hypertension  for which he was prescribed antihypertensive medication that he admits to not taking regularly. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years. He has no known drug allergies. There is no family history of any significant cardiovascular disease. He has been living a sedentary lifestyle with a high-fat diet.   Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 200/120 mm Hg in his right arm and 160/90 mm Hg in his left arm  pulse rate 110 beats/min  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  and the patient appears uncomfortable due to pain. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds without any murmurs  jugular venous distention  or peripheral edema. Pulmonary  abdominal  and neurological examinations are unremarkable.  Given the patient's history  physical examination findings  and demographic details  aortic dissection is suspected  and immediate diagnostic and management steps are undertaken.
Aortic Dissection,2,2,Patient Presentation:  A 61-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain radiating to his back. The pain began roughly 2 hours ago while he was working in his backyard and has progressively worsened since.  His past medical history includes uncontrolled hypertension  a 20-year smoking history  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He also reports a high cholesterol level but non-compliant with diet changes and statin medication. His BMI is 29. No history of surgery is reported.   Despite taking his antihypertensive medications  his blood pressure at presentation is 175/95 mmHg. He does not have diabetes  but his eating habits were poor which contribute to his obesity.  In the ED  his physical examination exhibits slight diaphoresis and pallor. Auscultation reveals a faint diastolic murmur. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  An EKG shows non-specific ST segment changes but no signs of myocardial infarction. Urgent computed tomography angiography reveals a dissection involving the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. The patient is rushed to the operating room for emergent cardiovascular surgery.
Aortic Dissection,2,3,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of poorly controlled hypertension and cigarette smoking. He has been complaining of sudden and severe chest pain radiating towards the back. He describes the pain as ripping or tearing sensation which had a sudden onset while he was doing house chores. He is also feeling weak and dizzy. He has a history of uncompliant hypertension treatment over the past ten years  and a 20-pack year history of smoking. His family history is significant for early cardiac deaths in his father and grandfather. No history of high cholesterol levels or diabetes. He admitted to not adhering to a healthy diet and his engagement in physical activities is minimal. The patient does not have any prior surgeries. Furthermore  he denies any symptoms of fever  cough  shortness of breath  or recent illnesses.    Upon physical examination  he seems uncomfortable with evident anxiety. His vital signs were recorded as blood pressure of 170/105mmHg in left arm and 155/100mmHg in right arm  a heart rate of 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  and a body temperature of 98.6 degrees F. His cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency.    Based on his age  race  history of uncontrolled hypertension  and current symptoms  a diagnosis of aortic dissection was considered. This was confirmed by Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA).
Aortic Dissection,2,4,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jack Donovan is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency room with sudden and severe pain in the chest radiating to the back. He reports the pain began while he was shoveling snow in his driveway. He describes the pain as a tearing sensation. The pain is 10 out of 10 in intensity. His past medical history is significant for hypertension  which he reports has been poorly controlled. He has a history of tobacco use  smoking a pack a day for about 35 years. He is on antihypertensive medication  but he admits to having forgotten to take it sometimes over the past few weeks. He denies any known personal or family history of connective tissue diseases or aneurysms. The patient looks uncomfortable with a look of anxiety in his expression.  Physical exam: Blood pressure is 170/95 mmHg on the right arm and 155/90 mmHg on the left arm  heart rate is 110 bpm  respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute and temperature is 98.6°F. Cardiac exam is significant for a diastolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space which may indicate aortic regurgitation.  Based on his presenting symptoms  physical exam findings  demographic details  and significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and tobacco use  the impression is raising high suspicion for an aortic dissection.  Considering recent population studies  aortic dissection is most common in males aged 60-70 years old  which is consistent with our patient. Lastly  Mr. Donovan's risk factors like uncontrolled hypertension  and long-term tobacco use make him a high-risk candidate for aortic dissection. The next step would be immediate medical stabilization  including pain control and blood pressure management  and confirmatory tests for aortic dissection such as CT scan.
Aortic Dissection,2,5,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 66-year-old African American male with a known history of uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  and an episode of uncomplicated myocardial infarction 6 years ago. He presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and it started about 2 hours ago. He also reports mild dyspnea  but denies any nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. He is slightly diaphoretic and looks anxious.  Vitals on arrival show a blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg  heart rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical examination  he is found to have a blood pressure discrepency  with a higher reading in his right arm compared to his left.   He is up to date on his vaccinations  and his last wellness exam was over a year ago. Daily medications include aspirin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril. Despite medication compliance  his blood pressure remains poorly controlled. He has been a smoker for 40 years.   Given his presenting symptoms and history  there is a high clinical suspicion of aortic dissection. Urgent imaging and cardiovascular surgical consultation will be needed."
Aortic Dissection,2,6,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Torres  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that began approximately two hours ago. The pain is described as """"tearing"""" and radiates to his back. He notes the pain started while he was at rest  and has progressively gotten worse. He rates it as 10 out of 10 on the pain scale.   Mr. Torres has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which he was diagnosed with 10 years ago. He is currently on Lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Metoprolol 50 mg twice daily but admits he has poor compliance due to his busy  usually stressful schedule. He also has a 30-pack year smoking history  but he quit five years ago. His family history is noteworthy for his father  who suffered a myocardial infraction at the age of 70.  On physical examination  Mr. Torres appears anxious. His blood pressure is 190/100 mmHg in the right arm and 160/80 mmHg in the left arm. Heart sounds are normal  without murmur. Neurological exam reveals no neurological deficits.   Given his history and presentation  an urgent CT angiogram is ordered to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection. Although generally seen in older men  this case aligns with the literature showing that African American males have higher rates of aortic dissection  especially in the context of a significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and smoking."
Aortic Dissection,2,7,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old African-American male presents to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden and severe sharp pain in his chest and back that started an hour ago while he was mowing the lawn. The pain is an 8 on the 10-point scale and appears to be radiating down towards the abdomen. Patient looks visibly distressed because of the pain and appears pale and sweaty.  Patient has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for almost 15 years which he says is usually around 170/100 mmHg  despite being on regular antihypertensives. He also has a history of 45 pack-years smoking but quit 5 years ago. He has no other known coronary artery disease  diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  or any family history of aortic disease. He says he did not experience similar symptoms before. He is allergic to penicillin and takes prescribed medication (amlodipine and metoprolol) irregularly.  On examination  the patient's blood pressure is recorded as 180/110 mmHg and pulse of 110 bpm. His left arm blood pressure is significantly higher than the right arm  and a diastolic decrescendo murmur is audible on auscultation. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable  and the patient is afebrile. Neurological examination demonstrates no deficits.  This presentation is suggestive of aortic dissection  and immediate further investigations  including a CT angiogram  have been advised. The patient has been informed of the potential critical nature of his condition  and the necessity for prompt intervention to manage his case has been stressed. 
Aortic Dissection,2,8,"Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American man with a past medical history of smoking  chronic high blood pressure  and high cholesterol presents to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden-onset chest and back pain. The pain is reported as “tearing” or “ripping” and started suddenly about two hours prior to his arrival.  The patient reports the pain as 10/10  and says it radiates from his chest through to his back. He also notes a feeling of """"fullness"""" in his chest. He has no history of similar pain. He denies any recent trauma  nausea  vomiting  shortness of breath  cough  dizziness  or fainting spells.  On physical examination  he appears distressed due to the pain. He is hypertensive with a blood pressure reading of 170/110 mmHg. His pulse is irregular with a rate of about 110 beats per minute. He has no visible edema  cyanosis  or jugular venous distension. Auscultation of the heart reveals a diastolic murmur. There is a discrepancy in blood pressure between his right and left arms.  The patient's past medical history reveals that he has been diagnosed with hypertension for 20 years but has been inconsistent with his antihypertensive medication use. He also has dyslipidemia  for which he takes statins  and has been smoking a pack of tobacco cigarettes daily for around 40 years.  Given the patient's clinical picture and history  a diagnosis of aortic dissection is suspected."
Aortic Dissection,2,9,"Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old African American male presented with sudden  severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  which began approximately two hours before he arrived in the emergency department. His vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg and a heart rate of 90 bpm. The patient reported an associated feeling of """"impending doom""""  difficulty in breathing  and dizziness.   Demographics:  The patient is a retired truck driver  a non-smoker  living with his wife in an urban setting  who consumes alcohol moderately  specifically beer  during social events. He is not a known drug abuser.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for at least fifteen years  for which he has been on Lisinopril and Amlodipine. His compliance with medication is poor due to his belief in alternative medicine. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia three years ago for which he takes Simvastatin irregularly. He reported a few episodes of transient chest pain in the past which he self-attributed to 'stress'. His father had suffered from a heart attack in his sixties.  This clinical presentation suggests an aortic dissection  which is particularly prevalent in hypertensive  African American males over 60 years old. His blood pressure and heart rate are dangerously high  and the patient's symptoms (chest pain  feeling of impending doom  difficulty breathing and dizziness) are typically associated with aortic dissections. His previous history of cardiac diseases also suggests an increased risk of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,2,10,Patient Presentation:   Mr. James Craig  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the Emergency Department reporting a sudden onset of severe chest pain described as tearing that started approximately four hours ago. The pain is radiating to his back  between his shoulder blades.  His past medical history reveals he has hypertension which he admits to not managing well due to lack of adherence to his antihypertensive treatment prescribed by his primary care physician. He also has a smoking history of 20-pack years. He denies use of any recreational drugs. His family history includes a father who had an aortic aneurysm at an elderly age.  On physical examination  his blood pressure is noted to be significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left  and on auscultation  a diastolic murmur is detected. A chest x-ray reveals a mediastinal widening and his ECG is normal. He appears anxious and is in acute distress due to the severe pain.  In view of suspected aortic dissection  emergency computed tomography (CT) of the aorta is being arranged. The patient is placed on IV nitroprusside to decrease blood pressure and pain control is achieved with morphine. 
Aortic Dissection,2,11,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with a sudden  severe chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes the pain as a tearing sensation. He also experiences nausea  sweating  and shortness of breath.  The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 8 years and a 35-year history of tobacco use. The patient also had a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in his early adult years  a condition that affects the body's connective tissue. His family history reveals a father who had an aortic dissection at the age of 72. The patient has not been compliant with his antihypertensive medications.  On examination  his blood pressure is significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left. A diastolic murmur is also audible in the second right intercostal space. An EKG shows no changes suggestive of a myocardial infarction. His body mass index is 30 kg/m2  indicative of obesity.  The presentation points towards a likely diagnosis of an aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,2,12,Patient Presentation:  Mr. R is a 67-year-old African American male who arrived in the emergency department appearing pale and sweating. He complains of sudden severe pain in the chest and back that started an hour ago  describing it as 'tearing' or 'ripping'. The pain has not been relieved nor aggravated by movement or changes in body position. It was accompanied by shortness of breath and fainting. He denies having similar pains in the past and does not recall any injury that could relate to his current symptomatology.   Mr. R is a retired mechanic  a current smoker with a 40-pack year history. He drinks alcohol occasionally. His past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been managed with lisinopril for the last 15 years.   Mr. R's father died of a myocardial infarction in his early 60s and his mother had a stroke at the age of 78  subsequently his family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. Despite this  Mr. R has never been worked up for heart disease other than having had his blood pressure managed. He has been largely non-compliant with his hypertension therapy for the past few months due to financial issues.  On examination  his blood pressure is elevated  with a difference between the right and left arms. His pulse rate is 110 beats per minute but irregular. Mental status exam reveals mild confusion. Cardiac examination reveals a diastolic murmur. Lung examinations are clear. His lower extremities are cold to touch with diminished peripheral pulses.   Despite initial treatment  his pain and discomfort only slightly decrease. His EKG shows non-specific changes but no findings suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The suspicion of aortic dissection is high due to his history  presentation  and initial clinical findings. CT angiogram is planned to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,13,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with sudden and severe chest pain that radiates to his back  associated with shortness of breath. The pain is tearing in nature and started suddenly about two hours ago during physical exertion. He describes his pain as the worst he has ever experienced.   He has a significant medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years  for which he has not been regular with his medications. He also has a known history of smoking for the past 40 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. There is no known family history of heart disease.   On examination  his blood pressure is found to be significantly high at 180/95 mmHg  with a difference of 20 mmHg between the left and right arms. His pulse is 110 beats per minute. There is a diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. Neurological examination is unremarkable and no limb weakness or sensory loss is detected.   The diagnostic picture thus points towards the possibility of an aortic dissection. It is necessary to proceed with immediate imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and further plan the management. His elevated blood pressure  history of hypertension  and smoking habit are significant risk factors for aortic dissection.  This presentation is crucial due to the high mortality rate associated with untreated aortic dissection. Early identification and management may aid in better patient outcomes. 
Aortic Dissection,2,14,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Smith is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer by profession. He presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain that started an hour ago while he was having his lunch. He described the pain as a sharp and tearing sensation through the midline of his chest  radiating to his back. He has a 20 year history of hypertension and was diagnosed with high cholesterol two years ago  both conditions are loosely controlled on medications.  He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking cigarettes.   The knock-on effects of his hypertension include left ventricular hypertrophy  which was identified during an echocardiography report 5 years ago. He has been taking Lisinopril and Atorvastatin as prescribed by his primary care physician  but has been inconsistent with taking his medications due to side-effects. Mr. Smith denies any history of trauma  aortic interventions  connective tissue disorders  or familial thoracic aortic diseases. He denies illicit drug use.  The only significant family history he reported was that his father passed away in his 60s due to a myocardial infarction. He did not report related symptoms like shortness of breath  dizziness  or palpitations but looked anxious and worried due to the severity of the chest pain. His social history is notable for alcohol use; he reports having a few beers on weekends. His daughter accompanied him to the hospital and reported that he had been complaining of general malaise for the past few days.
Aortic Dissection,2,15,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Sanchez is a 62-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the emergency department with a complaint of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain started about an hour before his arrival and has not subsided. He describes it as a ripping sensation. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  smoking for 40 years  and also has a familial history of aortic dissection in his father.   On examination  his blood pressure is found to be markedly different in both arms  180/100 in the right and 160/95 in the left. A murmur of aortic regurgitation is heard. He appears anxious and diaphoretic.   The high-risk features of his condition include his age  male sex  history of hypertension  and his family history of aortic dissection. The sudden onset of severe pain  the radiating nature of it  and the differences in blood pressure between his arms are suggestive of an aortic dissection. The history of smoking also increases his risk of aortic and other vascular diseases. 
Aortic Dissection,2,16,Patient Presentation  Mr. Smith is a 67-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain that he describes as “tearing” in nature. The pain dichotomously radiates to his back. The patient also reports feeling short of breath  along with mild dizziness.   Past medical history reveals that he has lived with hypertension for 30 years and has a history of smoking. He is restricted from physical activity due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he is on an inhaler. Additionally  he informs the attending physician of his habit of alcohol consumption and that he smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  Medical history also includes aortic valve stenosis  for which he underwent aortic valve replacement ten years prior to this episode. The patient reports that he has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication  losartan  for the past month due to financial difficulties.   Of note  his father suffered a stroke at the age of 60. There are no other known hereditary diseases in the family. Although Mr. Smith leads a rather sedentary lifestyle  his diet largely consists of high-sodium processed foods. He resides with his wife in a suburban home and is retired.   The physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg in his left arm  while the right arm reading is 160/90 mmHg. Mr. Smith also has a pulse of 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Pulses in the lower extremities are diminished bilaterally. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.   Given Mr. Smith’s history and the nature of his present symptoms  the healthcare team has immediate concerns for aortic dissection. Further diagnostic testing is pursued to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,17,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  a retired firefighter  presented to the ER with sudden onset  acute severe chest pain radiating to his back. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and stated it began while he was working in his yard.   Past Medical History:  He has a known medical history of chronic uncontrolled hypertension  smoking for 25 years (though he quit over a decade ago)  and a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago.  Family History: There is no significant pertinent family history.  Current Medications:  He is currently on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril 20mg) and low-dose Aspirin.  Relevant Findings:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was significantly high at 180/110 mmHg. There was a noted pulse discrepancy between the upper limbs.   This combination of clinical presentation  severe hypertension  and vascular discrepancies  coupled with his past medical history  raised a strong suspicion for an aortic dissection. An immediate CT angiography was ordered for confirmation."
Aortic Dissection,2,18,"Patient Presentation Example:  A 65-year-old African-American man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  sharp  tearing pain in the chest radiating to the back  dyspnea  and anxiety. The pain is described as worst pain ever experienced by the patient. He also reports feeling """"a ripping sensation"""" in the center of his chest. The pain started while he was trying to lift a heavy box at his home. It prompted him to sit down due to the severity  and did not subside with rest.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled for the past 10 years due to inconsistent follow up and medication non-adherence. He also has a history of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis and smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. The patient has been non-compliant with his diet and medication regimen  often skipping his blood pressure medication. His family history is also remarkable for hypertension in his parents and an older brother.   He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His regular medications include Lisinopril and Amlodipine for blood pressure control  and he is on a renal diet.   On physical examination  the patient is anxious and in visible distress. His blood pressure reading is markedly different between his right arm (166/98 mmHg) and left arm (140/88 mmHg). His heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Pulses in his bilateral lower extremities are difficult to palpate. On auscultation  a diastolic murmur is noted.  Considering the patient's symptoms  differential blood pressure  and past medical history  the working diagnosis is aortic dissection. An emergent CT angiography of the thorax confirms the diagnosis  showing a type A aortic dissection. The patient is immediately referred to the Cardiothoracic surgery for surgical intervention."
Aortic Dissection,2,19,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. R  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with severe  tearing pain in his chest radiating to his back. He describes the pain as """"worst he has ever experienced"""" and that it started abruptly about an hour before his arrival. He has also been experiencing episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath. On further questioning  he admits to antihypertensive medication non-compliance.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension over 15 years  smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years and a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA). His father passed away at 70 due to heart disease. On examination  his blood pressure is found disproportionately high in the right arm compared to the left. Heart sounds are normal with no audible murmur and there is no peripheral edema. His EKG shows no signs of myocardial infarction. The findings so far raise clinical suspicion of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,2,20,"Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African-American male presents to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as sharp and """"tearing""""  and ratings it a 10/10. He also reports feeling short of breath  slight confusion  and lightheadedness. He has a known history of untreated hypertension and has been a smoker for over 40 years.   His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg and a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. He has a significant discrepancy in blood pressure between both arms. A soft early diastolic murmur is noted on cardiac examination. Neurologic examination demonstrates a unilateral lower extremity weakness. He has an anisocoric pupil and mild ptosis on the left  suggestive of Horner’s syndrome.   Patient's family history reveals his father died of a stroke and his mother suffered from heart disease. On social history  he admits to less than ideal eating habits  low moderate exercise  and daily alcohol use.   The clinical profile  high blood pressure  and examination findings suggest an aortic dissection  which is a critical  life-threatening condition. His male gender  age  African-American ethnicity  family history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle might be contributing factors to his current condition. His symptoms  such as severe and sudden chest and back pain  shortness of breath  confusion  and neurologic signs  are significant features in the clinical presentation and should promote urgent diagnostic imaging and management."
Aortic Dissection,2,21,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back. Pain is described as 10/10 in intensity  starting approximately two hours ago while he was at rest. He also reports dizziness and shortness of breath but denies any other symptoms including loss of consciousness  palpitations  nausea  or vomiting. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension which has been poorly controlled. The patient has a 50 pack-year smoking history; he also used to consume alcohol but has been abstinent for 20 years. He has never been diagnosed with any heart disease before this instance. His father passed away from a heart attack at 70 years of age  and his older brother has a history of peripheral arterial disease. His physical examination shows high blood pressure (170/90 mmHg) and a diastolic murmur at the right second intercostal space. His labs show an elevated d-dimer level. 
Aortic Dissection,2,22,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department with severe  sudden onset chest pain. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back  which started about an hour ago while he was at home. He rates the pain at 10/10  unaffected by movement or breathing.   Mr. Johnson  a retired construction worker  has a past medical history significant for Stage 2 hypertension  which has been controlled by losartan for the last 10 years. He also has a 40-pack year history of smoking  but quit smoking around 5 years ago. He denies any family history of cardiac conditions. His BMI is 29  reflecting overweight status.  Concerning the symptoms  he also complained about mild shortness of breath. His ability to talk in full sentences and no signs of respiratory distress suggest absence of any acute respiratory problem.   On general examination  he is afebrile and looks uncomfortable. His BP is 170/100 mm of Hg in the right arm and 155/90 mm of Hg in the left arm. His pulse rate is 78 bpm  regular  and equal in all peripheries. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.  An initial EKG does not show any ST segment changes and troponin levels are normal.   This patient's age  race  history of uncontrolled hypertension  and previous smoking habit place him at a higher risk of an aortic dissection. The presentation of severe chest pain with a tearing nature and variation of BP between the arms increase suspicion for this diagnosis. An urgent imaging study is vital for the confirmation  usually a CT Angiography. "
Aortic Dissection,2,23,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thomas Harrison is a 62-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with an onset of sudden severe  tearing pain in the chest radiating through to his back  along with shortness of breath  excessive sweating  and a sense of impending doom. The pain is described as pressure-like  unrelieved by nitroglycerin and is accompanied by faintness.  His relevant past medical history includes uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years  3 years of poorly controlled diabetes and a smoking history of 30 pack-years. No history of loss of consciousness  trauma  or prior cardiovascular interventions. No family history of aortic dissection or other connective tissue disorders.  On physical examination  blood pressure is found markedly different in each arm (170/100 in the right  126/86 in the left). A diastolic murmur noted on examination prompting the medical team to order further imaging to investigate the possibility of aortic dissection. His ECG showed no ischemic changes.  Clinically  Mr. Harrison's age  race  uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  and the sudden onset of severe tearing chest pain  difference in blood pressure between arms etc suggest a high suspicion for aortic dissection. An urgent CT scan was ordered for further evaluation.
Aortic Dissection,2,24,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 69-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 20 pack-year tobacco use. He presents to the emergency department complaining of acute onset severe  tearing  and radiating chest pain from his anterior to his posterior chest  which started while he was having his breakfast.  He further describes the pain as the most severe he has ever felt  with an intensity of 10/10 that it made him break out in cold sweat and feel nauseous though no vomiting. The pain seemed to migrate downwards in its course. He denies any recent trauma  recent surgeries  fever  cough  or respiratory distress and has no history of similar pain except for intermittent episodes of intense headache.  On admission  his blood pressure was noted to be 180/100 mm Hg and pulse rate 105 beats/min. The blood pressure in the right arm was about 20 points higher than in the left arm. His BMI was calculated to be 29 indicating obesity.   His medications include amlodipine  atorvastatin  and low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention  with poor medication adherence reported. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease in his father  who passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. He lives with his wife  is retired  and has been a regular smoker for the past 40 years.  Given his acute  severe  tearing chest pain in the context of uncontrolled hypertension and a significant tobacco history  there is a high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection. Immediate investigations including EKG  chest X-ray  and CT angiogram are being arranged.
Aortic Dissection,2,25,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension and heavy smoking  currently complaining of a sudden  severe """"tearing"""" chest pain that started a few hours ago. He states that the pain began in the chest and has since migrated to his back. He describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced  rating it as a 10/10 on the severity scale and differing from his previous episodes of angina.   He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications due to financial constraints and lack of insurance. Other than hypertension  the patient also has a history of high cholesterol levels and smoking about a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He denies any family history of aortic aneurysms  Marfan's syndrome  or other connective tissue disorders. He denies any known drug allergies.   On examination  he is diaphoretic and appears acutely ill. His blood pressure is found to be significantly different in both arms  and there is evidence of decreased peripheral pulses. No audible murmur is detected during his cardiac auscultation.   He is immediately sent for further cardiovascular imaging. The presentation and symptoms suggest strongly towards aortic dissection  and early diagnosis and intervention are critical."
Aortic Dissection,2,26,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old African-American male  presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and has persisted  becoming progressively worse. He describes it as a sharp  tearing sensation. He also reports feeling slightly short of breath  but denies cough  fever  or any other symptoms.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years. It was diagnosed when he was 47 years old and although he was prescribed medication  he has been noncompliant with his treatment and does not routinely monitor his blood pressure. He also has a history of cigarette smoking (half a pack per day for 30 years but quit 5 years ago). His father died of a stroke at the age of 67  and he has an elder brother who died of aortic dissection at age 65. He does not have diabetes  any history of heart issues  or other chronic illnesses.   His current medications include Amlodipine 5mg once daily  which he is inconsistent in taking. However  he reports no known drug allergies.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  his blood pressure is significantly different between his arms (160/90 mmHg on the right and 130/80 mmHg on the left). He appears to be in moderate distress due to pain. Cardiovascular exam is notable for a diastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. His lungs are clear to auscultation.   Emergency Department Course:  Mr. Johnson is taken immediately for a CT scan  which reveals a Stanford Type A aortic dissection  necessitating immediate surgery.  Based on reported risk factors for aortic dissection among older males such as hypertension  family history  and smoking  Mr. Johnson's case is representative. Furthermore  it highlights the importance of blood pressure control and medication adherence in such patients to avoid emergencies like the one encountered here.
Aortic Dissection,2,27,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old male  Mr. Jackson  from African-American descent presents to the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain. He describes the sensation as a sudden tearing or ripping pain in the middle of his chest  radiating to his back. He also reports shortness of breath and a sense of impending doom. Patient also mentions a sudden onset of faintness and perspiration.   Demographic Details:  Mr. Jackson is a retired financial advisor  a smoker for the last 35 years with a pack a day. The patient continues to drink alcohol socially and admits to mild recreational drug misuse in his youth. His diet lacks fresh fruits and vegetables. He lives alone in the city but has two adult children in close communication.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has a documented history of hypertension which was uncontrolled for many years  but he has been compliant with his medication for the past three years. He also has hyperlipidemia and a previous diagnosis of Bicuspid Aortic Valve for which he underwent aortic valve replacement surgery ten years prior. His father passed away at the age of 57 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother is alive and well at the age of 86.   Based on the information given this patient falls under a high-risk group for aortic dissection due to his age  gender  race (with African-Americans having a higher incidence rate)  his history of hypertension and bicuspid aortic valve  unhealthy lifestyle  and family history of heart disease.
Aortic Dissection,2,28,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 65-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The patient also reported feeling short of breath  profuse sweating and nausea. His vital signs revealed elevated blood pressure.   Relevant Medical History:  Mr. J has a documented history of high blood pressure  for which he is currently taking Lisinopril but has been poorly compliant with his medication. He also has a 20 pack-year history of smoking and past medical history of bicuspid aortic valve. He has familial history of heart diseases - his father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at age 64.   Demographic Details:  He is a retired school teacher living with his wife in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. His ethnicity is consistent with a higher prevalence of hypertension  a critical risk factor for aortic dissection. His age and male sex also align with the typical demographic that presents with aortic dissection  which is most common in men  60 to 70 years old. His smoking and non-compliance with his anti-hypertensive medication have significantly contributed to his risk of developing aortic dissection. His history of bicuspid aortic valve  a congenital malformation associated with aortic dissection  is also a contributing factor.
Aortic Dissection,2,29,Patient Presentation  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain. He describes it as a tearing sensation that radiates to his back. The pain started about one hour ago which caused him to break out in a cold sweat and was associated with a feeling of impending doom.  He has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension  which he is on medications for but admits to not taking them regularly. The patient reports being a current smoker with a 20-pack-year smoking history and occasional alcohol user. His father expired due to myocardial infarction at an age of 58.  On physical examination  the patient is pale  diaphoretic  and appears restless. His BP is 180/110 mmHg in the right arm and 165/95 mmHg in the left. His pulse rate is 95 BPM  and his respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals a slightly decreased pulse and delayed capillary refill time in the right upper limb.  Considering his symptoms  past medical history and physical examination findings  aortic dissection is suspected  with his uncontrolled hypertension presenting a significant risk factor. An immediate CT aortogram is advised to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,30,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old African-American male who arrived in the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that started about two hours ago while lifting boxes at his job in the postal service. He described the pain as a tearing sensation radiating to his back  between the shoulder blades. He also reported some difficulty in breathing and lightheadedness but denied any nausea  fever  cough  or palpitations.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a 15-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  for which he is taking hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril  but admits noncompliance with his medication regimen due to side effects. Additionally  he has a 10-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily  and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease. There is no known history of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue disorders in his family. There is no previous significant history of surgeries  no known drug allergies and he denies any recreational drug use.   Demographics:  According to literature  the incidence of aortic dissection is more common in males over the age of 60  with hypertension as a major risk factor. Current smoking trends also suggest a higher prevalence among African American males. This case scenario reflects these demographics taking into account the overrepresented age  sex  race  and relevant risk factors associated with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,2,31,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Quinn  a 69-year-old African American male  presents himself in the emergency department with severe and sudden onset chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" which started around two hours ago. Mr. Quinn is a retired truck driver who is currently living in San Diego  California.  Mr. Quinn reports feeling unwell and has been experiencing profuse sweating. He mentions the pain started in his chest and has now migrated to his back. Although he did not lose consciousness  he reported feeling faint initially. He doesn't report any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath  cough  or palpitations.  James has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and moderately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 7 years. He has a 20-pack year history of smoking but he said he stopped smoking when he was diagnosed with diabetes. He has a family history of hypertension and heart disease; his father died of a heart attack at 72 and his older brother underwent bypass surgery 5 years back. He has been noncompliant with his hypertensive medications for about a fortnight due to financial constraints.  Mr. Quinn appears visibly distressed and is profusely sweating. Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 188/112 in the right arm and 160/98 in the left arm. His heart rate is rapid at 110 bpm. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. The neurologic examination is unremarkable.  Given Mr. Quinn's clinical presentation  history of hypertension and sudden onset chest pain  there is a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection. An immediate chest CT angiogram is justified to confirm the diagnosis. He is promptly started on aggressive antihypertensive therapy."
Aortic Dissection,2,32,Patient Presentation:  I am seeing Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African American male patient who presented to the ER with sudden  severe chest pain that started an hour ago. According to him  he started feeling an intense and sharp pain in his chest  that then migrated to his back  almost like a tearing or ripping sensation. Mr. Johnson reports that the pain was more severe than any pain he has ever experienced.  Mr. Johnson has a past medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol for which he has been on medication for the past 10 years. He also has a 35 pack-year history of smoking although he quit 5 years ago. He reports occasional alcohol use but denies any illicit drug use. There is no known family history of heart disease or any connective tissue disorders.  On initial assessment his blood pressure was 162/98 mmHg in the right arm and 154/92 mmHg in the left arm. His heart rate was 96 bpm  respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minutes and his O2 saturation is 95% on room air. His body mass index is 29 indicating he is overweight.  Given his risk factors of being hypertensive  his age  male gender  and his african american ethnicity  along with his symptom of a sudden severe chest pain that migrated to his back; I was highly suspicious of an aortic dissection. He was immediately stabilized and relevant imaging studies were ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,33,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with severe  sharp chest pain that started suddenly about 2 hours ago. The pain radiates to his back. According to him  the pain is different from anything he has experienced before  rated 10/10  and is not position-dependent or related to exercise. Apart from pain  he also reports having shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and feeling lightheaded.   Mr. Johnson has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 20 years and a smoking history of 40 pack-years. He quit smoking 5 years ago. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and underwent angioplasty. He also has a familial history of heart disease as his father had a heart attack at age 65.   He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication due to the side effects of the medication and financial problems. His regular medications include aspirin  clopidogrel  and atorvastatin.  On physical examination  he appears diaphoretic and in considerable distress from pain. His blood pressure is 200/120 mmHg  pulse 112 bpm  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 90% on room air  and temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F). A grade 3/6 diastolic murmur is heard over the left second intercostal space. An examination of peripheral pulses indicates that the pulse in the right arm is diminished compared to the left arm. Neurologically  he is oriented to time  place  and person  but appears anxious.  Given his age  history  and clinical presentation  an aortic dissection is highly suspected. Immediate medical attention and relevant investigations are warranted.
Aortic Dissection,2,34,Patient Presentation:  Mr. George R. is a 69-year-old African-American male presenting with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back between the shoulder blades  mimicking the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction that began at rest. The nature of pain is sharp  tearing and excruciating. He also reports difficulty breathing with light-headedness and sweating.  Past Medical History:  He is a known hypertensive for 20 years almost on regular medication but has been poorly compliant over the past few months. His hypertension was poorly controlled  with recent BP measurements in the outpatient clinic often being above 160/100 mmHg. Furthermore  he has a history of smoking  consuming at least a pack of cigarettes daily for about 30 years.  Family History:  Mr. George has a family history of a first-degree relative (his mother) who suffered an aortic dissection at age 75.   Lifestyle and Social History:  He denies alcohol or drug use. He is a retired engineer who lives alone and has neglected his general health after his wife passed away five years ago.  Review of Systems:  No nausea  vomiting  pallor  or loss of consciousness. The pain is not related to body position or exertion and it is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable  sweaty  and anxious. The blood pressure was found to be significantly different between the right and left arms  indicative of possible aortic dissection. The heart rate was slightly tachycardic but he was afebrile and his respiratory rate was at the upper limit of normal.  Given the severity of the pain  family history  and physical examination findings  the patient was immediately referred for cardiovascular imaging.
Aortic Dissection,2,35,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Brown is a 63-year-old African-American male who presents to the Emergency Department with acute onset severe chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" and radiates to his back. He states it started suddenly about two hours ago  without any triggering factors. It's unlike any pain he's experienced before.  He has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  existing for several years  and a prior history of smoking of about a one pack a day for 40 years  which he quit ten years ago. Incidentally  he also has familial hypercholesterolemia which is currently being managed with statins. He does not have regular checkups with his primary care physician but tries to manage his conditions as optimally as possible.  In terms of current symptoms  along with the pain  he also reports shortness of breath  feeling light-headed and experiencing palpitations. He denies experiencing any nausea  vomiting  sweating  or loss of consciousness.  He has no known allergies and is currently on Amlodipine and Atorvastatin for his blood pressure and high cholesterol respectively. There is a family history of early-onset heart disease  specifically  his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 52. "
Aortic Dissection,2,36,Patient Presentation:  Program: Cardiology Patient: Mr. Liston  a 62-year-old African American male Chief Complaint: Severe  sudden onset chest pain  History of Presenting Illness:  Mr. Liston states that he was having a normal day when he suddenly experienced an excruciating tearing pain in his chest that radiated through to his back  between his shoulder blades. The pain began while he was resting at home and has progressively worsened over the past hour. He describes the pain as a constant  severe  sharp  and worst he has ever felt. He denies any alleviating or exacerbating factors and states he also feels dizzy  short of breath  and nauseous. He denies history of trauma  surgery  or recent heavy lifting.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Liston has a significant history of hypertension  for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide  but admits he hasn't been compliant in taking his medications regularly  nor in monitoring his blood pressure. He also has a 20-year history of smoking  with 1 pack per day. No known allergies.  Family History:  His father died from a heart attack at the age of 67  and his mother died from stroke at the age of 64.  Social History:  Mr. Liston is a retired construction worker. He has been married for 35 years and lives with his wife. He continues to smoke but denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  Review of Systems:  No recent weight change  fevers  cough  abdominal pain  urinary symptoms  or other systemic symptoms. He reported dizziness which became worse upon changing positions. The dizziness is occasionally accompanied by diaphoresis.  Validation:  The reported details are consistent with the epidemiology of aortic dissection  which commonly occurs in hypertensive  male patients in their 60s-70s. The sudden severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping  radiating to the back  associated with dizziness  sweating  and difficulty breathing  are common symptoms of aortic dissection. The diagnosis of aortic dissection should be considered in this patient  and he should urgently receive appropriate diagnostic studies  like a CT angiogram of the chest. 
Aortic Dissection,2,37,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old African American male presenting in the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain that started about 2 hours ago. The pain  according to him  is """"tearing"""" in nature  located in the anterior chest and radiates to his back between the shoulder blades. Concurrently  he has also experienced shortness of breath  sweating  and light-headedness  hence his visit.  He has a 20-year past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension despite being on antihypertensive medications. He also reports a history of tobacco use  with a 40-pack year smoking history. Though not presently smoking  he only quit 2 years ago. Allegedly  there is no significant family history concerning cardiovascular diseases according to his knowledge.   Essential details such as his background  his known hypertension  and history of tobacco smoking are all noted as they tally with the risk factors often associated with development of aortic dissection as per literature. His demographic group (being male and African American) also makes incidence of the condition more probable when compared to women and other race groups."
Aortic Dissection,2,38,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American male presents to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he describes as a 'tearing' sensation that radiates to his back. He has never experienced this type of pain before. The patient also reports shortness of breath  nausea  and light-headedness. He rates his pain as a 10 on a scale from 0 to 10.  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which he's been taking Atenolol for the past 10 years. He also has a 20-year history of heavy smoking. There's no known history of heart disease in his family. He is a retired construction worker  currently living alone.  Physical examination reveals diaphoresis  an irregular pulse and a blood pressure of 170/105 mmHg. Breath sounds are semi-clear with coarse crackles over the left lung base. He is visibly anxious  and the pain appears unrelieved despite the administration of morphine in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  The patient's combination of severe  sudden onset chest pain  hypertension  his age  race  and smoking history- all these factors direct the differential diagnosis towards aortic dissection. Immediate diagnostic testing  including a CT scan of the chest  is warranted for further confirmation.
Aortic Dissection,2,39,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African-American male presenting to the emergency department with severe  sharp chest and back pain that started suddenly about an hour ago. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and rates it a 10 out of 10 in terms of intensity. It started in his chest and has since radiated to his back.   He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which he is on amlodipine  but admits to non-compliance with his medication regimen.   He is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history and quit 10 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol  primarily during social outings. Mr. Johnson also has a family history of heart disease  with his father having had a heart attack in his 60s.  He denies any associated shortness of breath  cough  or abdominal pain. No loss of consciousness  dizziness  or weakness. He denies recent trauma or injury.   This presentation  in combination with his medical history  would warrant immediate investigation for possible aortic dissection which is a potentially life-threatening condition. His race  age  hypertension  and a history of smoking puts him at a higher risk for aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,2,40,Patient Presentation:  Mr. A is a 60-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe  sharp chest pain radiating to the back. The discomfort started while he was having dinner about 2 hours prior to his arrival at the hospital.  He reports a history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past few years. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago  which has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. More recently  he had been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and prescribed statin therapy  but due to financial constraints  he was unable to afford the medication and subsequently stopped taking it.  He has a 30-pack-year smoking history  and drinks alcohol socially. His father had a stroke at the age of 70 and his mother passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 78.  Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg  Heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a temperature of 98.6°F. On auscultation of the chest  a diastolic murmur is heard along with decreased breath sounds in the left lung field.  Given the acute onset of symptoms  his longstanding uncontrolled hypertension  and relevant family history of cardiovascular events  a suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection is made. He is immediately referred for a CT scan of the chest to confirm.
Aortic Dissection,2,41,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Hispanic male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden  severe upper back pain which he described as tearing. The pain reportedly started while the patient was at rest. He also acknowledged a history of hypertension which has been partially managed but often runs high due to noncompliance with medication. His other past medical history included a smoking habit of 30 pack years and hyperlipidemia.   He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or lower extremity weakness. However  he also reported that he has been feeling light-headed since the onset of back pain. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease with his father passing due to a heart attack in his early 70s.  Upon physical examination  there was a noted difference in blood pressure between the right and left upper extremities. An immediate CT scan of the chest was ordered  which demonstrated a type B aortic dissection.  His vital signs upon arrival are as follows:  Blood pressure: 170/95 mmHg right arm  150/90 mmHg left arm Pulse: 92 beats per minute Respiration: 20 breaths per minute Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C) O2 Saturation: 96% on RA BMI: 29.6 (overweight)  Rest of the examination was unremarkable.   Note: This is an example of a concise patient presentation and does not necessarily represent all possible presentations of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,2,42,"Patient Presentation:  A 66 years old African American male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" in nature  which started while he was cleaning his garage. The patient states that the pain radiated to his back and since then  continuing for several hours. He is experiencing shortness of breath but denies any nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. He has no known history of trauma or injury. The patient is diaphoretic and appears uncomfortable. He denies any similar previous episodes. He is a former smoker with 30-year pack history  quit 5 years back.   His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension  despite being on antihypertensive therapy with a thiazide diuretic  and beta-blocker. He was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years back. He also has a known history of hyperlipidemia presently under control with statins. He reports occasional alcohol intake but denies any recreational drug use. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father died at the age of 60 due to myocardial infarction.  His blood pressure in right arm measured 182/98 mm Hg and 158/90 mm Hg in left arm. A grade 3/6 systolic murmur was appreciated on the left sternal border. Other physical examination findings include weak femoral pulses bilaterally. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.   This presentation is suggestive of aortic dissection and further diagnostic imaging and management would be required for confirmation and subsequent decision making. "
Aortic Dissection,2,43,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Liu is a 65-year-old Asian male with a past medical history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and a 30-year history of smoking. He does not have any significant familial heart disease history.   He presents to the emergency room with severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as a """"tearing"""" sensation. It started while he was lifting a heavy object at home. He does not mention any other concurrent symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  shortness of breath  or palpitations. On further examination  he exhibits unequal arm blood pressures and has a slightly decreased heart rate.  On review of his previous medical records  it's evident that his hypertension has been resistant to therapy despite being on multiple medications. His only other co-morbidity is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which he manages with occasional inhaler use. He has no known drug allergies. On average  he consumes two alcoholic drinks a week. He lives alone after his wife's death two years ago and has two children who live out of state.  The primary concern given Mr. Liu's presentation and history is aortic dissection  likely triggered by his chronic uncontrolled hypertension and exacerbated by his smoking history."
Aortic Dissection,2,44,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain characterized as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" in nature. The pain started while the patient was at rest and has progressively worsened over the past 2 hours. It radiates to his back  particularly between the shoulder blades.  Past medical history reveals long-standing hypertension for which he has been non-compliant in taking prescribed medication. The patient also has a 20-year history of tobacco use. He is a retired construction worker. His family history is significant for an older brother who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.  On examination  he appears to be in significant pain and distress  with slightly elevated blood pressure readings and an irregular pulse. The patient is breathing with some difficulty and appears sweaty and pale.   A quick bedside transthoracic echocardiogram shows signs of aortic dissection. Immediate intervention is planned."
Aortic Dissection,2,45,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Brown  a 60-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency room with a chief complaint of sudden severe chest pain pervading to his back. The pain  which he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature  began approximately 2 hours ago and has been steadily worsening.   Mr. Brown has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which he has been non-compliant with his prescribed medication due to cost. He also has a 40-year history of smoking one pack a day but quit smoking two years ago. He has no history of surgeries or other significant illnesses.   On admission  his vital signs are: blood pressure 180/120 mmHg  pulse 95 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 97% on room air  and body temperature 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Physical exam reveals a man in acute distress  anxious  and profusely sweating. He has an audible systolic murmur noted on cardiac auscultation. His pulses are equal in all four extremities.  Given his presentation and history  suspicion is high for aortic dissection. An immediate CT angiography is planned to confirm the diagnosis. Mr. Brown's hypertension increases his risk factor for acute aortic dissection. His non-compliance with antihypertensive therapy may have contributed to this potential acute event. The pain description given by him is fairly characteristic of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,2,46,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Davis  a 56-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department  complaining of a sudden onset  severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back for the past 4 hours. He states the pain was severe and worst when it began. In addition  he reports feeling lightheaded  shortness of breath and faint. He has no prior history of similar pain. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history. He also consumes alcohol occasionally  but denies any recreational drug use. His medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been poorly managed  and hyperlipidemia. He  however  has no history of Marfan syndrome or any familial history of cardiovascular diseases. He has not undergone any prior surgeries.   On examination  he appears profoundly diaphoretic. Initial vital signs reveal blood pressure to be 160/85 mmHg on the right arm and 145/80 mmHg on the left arm  pulse rate is 110 bpm  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  temperature is 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.   Given these signs and his significant past medical history  aortic dissection is strongly suspected. He was immediately transferred to a resuscitation bay for further investigations and management.
Aortic Dissection,2,47,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African-American male presenting with sudden onset of severe  tearing pain in his chest radiating to his back approximately 2 hours ago. He describes the pain as sharp  and worse than anything he has ever experienced. His attendant also reports that the patient has been sweating and looks pale.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years  poor medication adherence and control. He smokes approximately 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol socially. There is no known history of heart diseases in the family.  Recent History:  Mr. Johnson reports no recent physical exertion  trauma  or stressful event. He went to bed feeling well  only to be awakened by the pain. He took one of his """"blood pressure pills"""" at home when he felt unwell but did not notice any improvement  which prompted him to seek medical care.  Initial Physical Examination:  On physical examination  Mr. Johnson's blood pressure is found to be 190/100 mmHg. His pulse rate is 100 beats per minute with pulses palpable bilaterally in upper and lower limbs. Heart sounds are regular  without murmur. His pain does not alleviate when he leans forward. The remainder of his examination is unremarkable  and he is oriented towards time  place  and person.  Conclusions:  Considering the history and physical examination findings  the preliminary diagnosis is a suspected aortic dissection. Mr. Johnson's age  race  male sex  and history of hypertension are all significant risk factors for aortic dissection  as is his long history of smoking. The severe  tearing pain  with sudden onset and radiation to the back  is classic for aortic dissection.  Immediate Plan:  Stat EKG  chest X-ray  and if possible  CT scan of thorax are required. Pain control and antihypertensive therapy are the initial steps in management. The assessment of the severity of dissection and need for surgical intervention will depend on further diagnostic tests. His family needs to be notified and informed of seriousness of the condition."
Aortic Dissection,2,48,"Patient Presentation  Mr. Charles  a 70-year-old African-American retired truck driver  presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden  severe chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes the pain as """"ripping"""" and """"tearing"""" in nature. Neither rest nor sublingual nitroglycerin has relieved the pain. He also complains of shortness of breath  stating he feels as though he cannot catch his breath. He denies any history of trauma or cough prior to the onset of pain.  His past medical history includes hypertension  for which he is taking hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. He is also a smoker with a pack per day habit for 30 years. He consumes alcohol in moderation. Mr. Charles has a surgical history of a bilateral hip replacement due to osteoarthritis. He mentions that his mother also had hypertension and died of a stroke  but he's unclear about the details.   Upon examination  his blood pressure is noted to be significantly higher in one arm than in the other. There are signs of early shock such as sweating  rapid heart rate  and light-headedness. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur and blood investigations show elevated levels of D-dimer.  A chest radiograph reveals mediastinal widening and a CT angiogram subsequently confirms the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The patient is immediately prepared for a potential surgery in light of the severity of the condition  his significant risk factors and presenting symptoms."
Aortic Dissection,2,49,"Patient Presentation  Mr. Davis is a 67-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with abrupt onset of severe chest pain. The pain started approximately an hour ago and has been increasing in intensity. Mr. Davis describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"radiating"""" towards his back.  His medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past few years. He is a former smoker  with a history of smoking for 35 years  but quit 10 years ago. He admits to having a few occasional drinks. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease - his older brother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother had a stroke when she was 75.  On examination  there is a differential blood pressure between his arms  with the left arm reading significantly higher than the right. He presents mild sweating  pale complexion  and noticeable discomfort. His heart sounds are normal  but a 'blowing' diastolic murmur can be heard.  Mr. Davis's demographic and health profile make him a typical patient for an aortic dissection. Male sex  advanced age  and African American ethnicity are factors associated with a higher risk of aortic dissection. His long history of poorly controlled hypertension  prior smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease further contribute to his risk profile."
Aortic Dissection,2,50,Patient Presentation  Mr. Nelson  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes it as the worst pain he's ever felt  which started while he was lifting heavy items in his garage. He also reports shortness of breath and light-headedness.   His past medical history is significant for long-standing uncontrolled hypertension despite taking antihypertensive medication. He also has a 20-year history of tobacco use  and a family history of aortic diseases - a brother who had an aortic aneurysm and a father who died from complications of aortic dissection.   His vital signs upon admission include blood pressure of 165/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation level of 93% on room air. Examination reveals an anxious and distressed patient with diaphoresis. Furthermore  there is a discrepancy in the patient's blood pressure readings in both arms. Thus  aortic dissection is greatly suspected due to his history  present symptoms  hypertension  and varying blood pressure. Immediate diagnostic workup  including computed tomography angiography (CTA)  is initiated to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management.

He describes the pain as """"the worst pain I have ever experienced """" rating it a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. The pain was followed by profuse sweating and a feeling of impending doom. He denies any associated symptoms such as palpitations  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness.  His past medical history is significant for untreated hypertension  a 20 pack-year history of smoking  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He denies any previous diagnoses of connective tissue disorders or any history of recent trauma. He has no known drug allergies. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide which he reports sometimes missing when he feels “okay”.  On examination  he appears pale and diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg in his right arm and 160/100 mmHg in his left arm. His heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. There is a difference in the strength of his femoral and radial pulses.  The above presentation information has led to a suspicion of an aortic dissection and necessitates further diagnostic workup for confirmation."

Aortic Dissection,2,53,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Maria Gonzalez is a 67-year-old Latina female who arrived at the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset chest pain that radiates to her back. She describes it as tearing or ripping. She rates it as a 9 out of 10 for pain intensity. Accompanying the chest pain are symptoms of lightheadedness  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating.  She is a retired school teacher and does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her BMI is in the range of obesity. She resides with her husband and has three grown-up children. She reports her compliance with social distancing and hygiene protocols given the COVID-19 situation. She has a medical history of hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with antihypertensive medication - Losartan. She was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago  managed by Statins.  Her family history is significant. Her father died of stroke and her mother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and passed away due to heart failure.  Considering her severe chest pain with risk factors like hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  older age  and her family history of cardiovascular diseases  an aortic dissection is suspected. The patient requires immediate imaging studies  such as a CT angiogram  to confirm the diagnosis.  Note: Aortic dissection is more common in males and in older patients (60-80 years). Aortic dissection is most commonly associated with hypertension - more than 75% of patients have a history of hypertension. The presentation may be influenced by race/ethnicity and cultural health beliefs  perceptions  and behaviors.
Aortic Dissection,2,54,"Patient Presentation:   A 68-year-old Hispanic male  Mr. Dominguez  presents to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden and severe """"tearing"""" pain in his chest which radiates through to his back. He describes it as """"the worst pain he has ever felt."""" The pain was not associated with exertion  shortness of breath  or sweating. However  he mentions feeling dizzy and nauseated.   His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled hypertension for 10 years  a 40-pack year smoking history  and mild hyperlipidemia. His hypertension was being treated with amlodipine but he had been sporadically compliant with the medication. He has no personal or family history of connective tissue or chronic inflammatory diseases.   He lives alone and is retired. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His current vitals show he has high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg) with differential pulse rate and blood pressure between his right and left arm. Physical examination reveals a diaphoretic patient in distress  but no cyanosis or pallor. Auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.   Considering the acute onset of his symptoms along with his past medical history and clinical findings  a suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection is made and immediate management is initiated."
Aortic Dissection,2,55,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jacobs is a 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  moderate aortic stenosis  and smoking. He was brought into the emergency department by his wife with chief complaints of sudden  severe chest pain that started an hour ago at home. According to Mr. Jacob  the pain is sharp  radiating to the back  and worsens with movement.   Furthermore  he describes his pain as """"tearing"""" in character  differing it from any chest pain he has had before. His wife adds that he became acutely short of breath and turned pale soon after the onset of the chest pain. He denies experiencing any nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis but admits to feeling lightheaded. He could not recall any precipitating factors or any personal or family history of such pain.   Over the past few months  despite prescribed and regular medication  his blood pressure has been poorly controlled. He has a 30-year history of tobacco and alcohol use but denies any current illicit substance use. He has not undergone any surgical procedures in the past.

Demographics:   Mr. Davis is a retired construction worker and a widower  living with his daughter. He has a 30-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and was a smoker for 40 years (2 packs/day). His father died at 71 with a similar chest pain  later diagnosed as aortic dissection at autopsy.   Past Medical History:   The patient's past medical history includes Hypertension  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease from prolonged smoking  Hyperlipidemia and Peripheral Arterial Disease. He had a myocardial infarction in his late 50s  but has been non-compliant with his heart medications  including his antihypertensives. His last recorded BP at a check-up a month ago was 180/100 mmHg.   Physical Examination:   Upon examination  his blood pressure is significantly different in both arms. Other pertinent findings include a diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space  suggesting aortic regurgitation. Neurological examination shows mild lower limb weakness and decreased reflexes. The patient is anxious and diaphoretic.   This information above is based on general demographic trends and individual variations are  of course  important. Aortic dissection tends to occur more frequently in males and African Americans and is often associated with hypertension and smoking. There may be a genetic component given his family history.   These symptoms paired with Mr. Davis' past medical history are highly suggestive of an aortic dissection and should be treated as a medical emergency."

On physical examination  he appears anxious and diaphoretic  with blood pressure measurements significantly different in the two arms and a weak pulse in the right arm. Lung auscultation reveals faint diastolic murmur  but no visible chest deformities or contusions. No neurological deficits noted at the time of examination. He denies any recent cough  fever  headache  or visual changes. Family history includes a brother who had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He is retired from his job as a construction worker and lives with his wife.
Aortic Dissection,2,76,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony Anderson is a 65-year-old African American male who presents to the Emergency Department (ED) reporting severe  ripping chest pain that started suddenly about 2 hours ago. The pain radiates to his back and is described as the """"worst pain of his life."""" He reports associated symptoms of diaphoresis  nausea  and shortness of breath. He denies any history of trauma or injury.  Mr. Anderson has a medical history significant for unchecked hypertension  a 45-pack a year history of smoking  and a previous myocardial infarction approximately two years ago for which he underwent stenting. His medications include Aspirin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine; however  he is not consistent in taking his medications due to financial restrictions.   On physical examination  he seems extremely anxious and diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 185/110 mm Hg in his right arm and 160/95 mm Hg in his left. Heart rate is 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space. Neurologic examination shows unequal pupil size  likely indicating compromised blood flow to the brain.  This clinical presentation of sudden onset of severe chest pain  history of hypertension  and the age  gender  and ethnicity of the patient raise strong suspicion for aortic dissection. Due to the high mortality rate associated with this condition  rapid diagnosis and treatment are crucial. He is planned for immediate management and diagnostic imaging to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,2,77,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African American male  presents in the emergency department with severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his back. He describes it as a tearing or ripping sensation. He also complains of shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a documented history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the years. He also had a history of smoking tobacco for around 20 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. Furthermore  he underwent an open cholecystectomy 8 years ago.  Family History:  His father passed away at the age of 70 due to a stroke and his mother has well-controlled hypertension. His eldest brother died at age 67 from a heart attack.   Social History:  He is a retired construction worker  living with his wife and dog. He denies alcohol use  but admits to smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years  though he claims he quit 10 years ago.   Discussion:  The patient’s presentation fits with a potential diagnosis of aortic dissection  which typically presents as abrupt severe chest or back pain  often described as tearing  ripping  or shearing in nature. This condition is most common in men in their 60s and 70s  and African Americans are disproportionately affected. The patient's history of long-standing hypertension and smoking both represent significant risk factors for aortic dissection. Given the seriousness of this condition  immediate attention and intervention are crucial.
Aortic Dissection,2,78,"A 65-year-old African-American man presents to the emergency department complaining of acute onset  severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain started suddenly about two hours ago  and is described as “tearing” or “ripping.” He rates the pain as being 10 out of 10 in severity. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled. He is a former smoker and quit 5 years. He denies having any past episodes of such severe pain. On physical examination  he is found to have a significantly elevated blood pressure and a rapid pulse. He is also noted to have differences in pulse and blood pressure between his right and left arms.  Additionally  upon further investigation the patient's family history revealed that his father died unexpectedly in his 60s due to an undiagnosed """"heart condition""""  hinting at a possible genetic susceptibility. In the emergency room  his EKG shows no signs of a regular heart attack  prompting physicians to order a CT Angiography immediately  strongly suspecting an aortic dissection. This medical condition is potentially life-threatening  and early detection and management could significantly improve the patient's prognosis."

He further describes the pain as a tearing sensation that radiates through to his back  rating it as a 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain was sudden onset without any preceding events or provocation. Accompanying his pain is a feeling of breathlessness and loss of consciousness twice since the onset of his symptoms.  Mr. Doe admits to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day since he was in his twenties. He was also diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  which he says is under control with his current medication regime. He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease and had a coronary artery bypass graft more than 10 years ago. He is also prediabetic and is monitored regularly by his primary care physician. His paternal uncle passed away in his 60s from an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He denies experiencing similar symptoms in the past. He denies current use of drugs and alcohol but admits to alcoholism in his 40s. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Mr. Doe is visibly anxious and sweaty  but his cognitive functions are intact. An examination reveals a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg in his right arm and 150/100 mmHg in his left arm with a heart rate of 98 bpm. His chest radiograph reveals a widened mediastinum. EKG shows no changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. A CT angiogram is ordered and confirms an ascending and descending thoracic aortic dissection. The hospital's cardiothoracic team is consulted and he is promptly sent for emergency surgery.
Aortic Dissection,2,84,Patient Presentation:  A 66-year-old African American male patient presents to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as 'tearing' in nature  with a sudden onset from resting position. The patient notes the pain started approximately 1 hour ago and it is unlike anything he has experienced before. He also notes associated diaphoresis  nausea and dizziness; however  denies any loss of consciousness.  The patient has a known medical history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past few years despite being on Lisinopril. He admits to being non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication at times. Patient has a 15 year history of smoking (1 pack per day)  and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  On clinical examination  the patient appeared distressed and his blood pressure was found to be elevated (170/100 mmHg)  heart rate was 120 beats per minute  and his respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. There were differences in blood pressure readings between the two arms which was also recordable. Neurological examination and other systemic examinations were within normal limits. Given his symptoms and medical history  aortic dissection was suspected and further investigations including a CT angiogram was planned.
Aortic Dissection,2,85,Patient Presentation:   Mr. James Ortiz  a 67-year-old African-American retired engineer with a known history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 40-year smoking history  presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of excruciating  tearing chest pain  described as the 'worst pain of his life'. The pain started approximately 2 hours prior to his clinic visit while he was mowing the lawn  and it radiates through to his back.  He reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing shortness of breath  but he denied any fevers  chills  cough  or night sweats. His other past medical history includes hyperlipidemia  and mildly impaired renal function. He has not been adherent to his prescribed antihypertensive medication because of concerns about cost.   He does not consume alcohol. He lives alone and is relatively sedentary due to his recent retirement.  On examining his cardiopulmonary system  he was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive with unevenly distributed pulses  and an early diastolic decrescendo murmur was heard on auscultation suggestive of aortic regurgitation. His lower limbs were cold and clammy to touch. His initial EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes  and his chest radiography revealed a widened mediastinum. The combination of his uncontrolled hypertension  radiating chest pain  associated symptoms  and abnormal physical exam raised the consideration of aortic dissection.   He was then sent for an urgent CT aortogram to confirm the diagnosis  with discussion towards immediate surgical consultation in the context of acute aortic dissection. Nurses were instructed to keep him calm and to keep his blood pressure under control with medications. His next of kin was notified and he was also informed on the condition and its seriousness.    Literature: Aortic dissection is more common in men (65%) and tends to occur more frequently in African-American individuals. The average age of patients with aortic dissection is 63 years. The two major risk factors for aortic dissection are hypertension and smoking. Other conditions that have been associated with aortic dissection include Marfan's syndrome  bicuspid aortic valve  and a previous history of cardiac surgery  though these were not mentioned in Mr. Ortiz's history. The patient's presentation with the sudden onset of severe thoracic pain that radiates to the back is classic for aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,2,86,Patient Presentation:  Mr. William Johnson is a 65-year-old African-American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  who presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain that he describes as 'ripping' and 'tearing' in nature. The pain started while he was at rest  approximately an hour ago  and has been constant since then. It radiates to his back  particularly between the shoulder blades  and is not associated with any physical activity or effort.   Mr. Johnson looks very uncomfortable  diaphoretic and pale. He reports feeling nauseated but has not vomited. He also reports feeling weak in his legs and describes them as 'squishy'.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has had a history of hypertension for 10 years  which has been poorly controlled with medication due to inconsistent use. He also has a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 25 years. He reveals that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 62. He does not have any known allergies.  Surgical History:  He has never had any surgical interventions and denies illicit drug use.  Family History:  As stated  his father died at an early age due to a heart condition  while his mother is alive and in her 80s  with a history of stroke. His older sister recently underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has no siblings with known heart conditions  but his two children are both hypertensive.  Social History:  He is a retired truck driver and lives alone. He quit drinking alcohol 10 years ago but still smokes daily and he is not physically active. He reports noncompliance with medications and infrequent visits to his primary care physician due to financial constraints.
Aortic Dissection,2,87,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with a complaint of severe  sudden onset chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain is described as a sharp  tearing sensation and commented as being unlike any other pain he has ever experienced. His prior medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension and he is also a current smoker. He reported getting anxious about the chest pain  and feeling sweaty and light-headed. No associated symptoms of shortness of breath  dizziness  nausea  palpitations  or syncope were reported. His late father had an aortic aneurysm. He admits to missing his medication doses occasionally due to forgetfulness. He lives alone and is retired from his work as a construction engineer.  Standard physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure numbers; 175/105 mmHg  noted in the left arm. His pulse is irregular and unevenly palpable. No neurological deficits or peripheral pulse deficiencies seen. Lung fields appear to be clear on auscultation and the rest of the physical examination is within normal limits except for a discrepancy in blood pressure readings between the two arms.  The nature of the pain description and strong risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension  age  racial background  sex and family history make an initial clinical suspicion for aortic dissection. An urgent CT aortogram is suggested alongside stabilizing the patient as per standard protocol.
Aortic Dissection,2,88,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old African American male  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking (pack-a-day for 25 years)  and a history of coronary artery disease requiring a stent placement 10 years ago. He presents to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset of interscapular pain described as sharp and tearing. His pain is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.   His blood pressure is significantly different in the right arm (210/120 mmHg) versus the left arm (180/100 mmHg)  and his heart rate is slightly elevated at 100 beats per minute. On examination  he shows some signs of confusion and mild weakness in his lower extremities. A vascular bruit is heard in the mid-epigastric area.   He is in obvious discomfort and the rapid onset and severity of his pain  combined with his history and blood pressure discrepancies  trigger the clinical suspicion for an aortic dissection. His demographic aligns with the research which suggests a higher incidence rate of aortic dissection in the male  elderly population  particularly in individuals with a history of hypertension and smoking. The patient also falls into the group associated with a higher incidence of aortic dissection  as studies have shown a higher occurrence in the African American population as compared to others. He will be urgently investigated with a CT aortography for confirmation of this diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,89,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  sharp  and tearing chest pain starting an hour ago and radiating to the upper back. He also reports shortness of breath and sweating along with the pain. He describes the pain as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10  unlike anything he has ever experienced before.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a documented history of hypertension for 10 years  controlled with Lisinopril 20mg daily. His blood pressure often remains uncontrolled. He is also a chronic smoker of 30 years  averaging about a pack of cigarettes daily. He was recently diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus  and it is being managed with Metformin. There is no history of cardiac disease in the family.  Review of Systems: He denies any loss of consciousness  vision changes  difficulty walking or moving his limbs. He does not complain of any nausea  vomiting  or abdominal pain.   Physical Examination: On examination  he is anxious  diaphoretic. Vitals: BP = 180/105mm Hg in the right arm and 165/98 mm Hg in the left arm  P = 100/min  RR= 28/min  Temp= 98.6 F  SpO2= 93% on room air. His cardiovascular examination reveals a soft early diastolic murmur best heard over the left sternal border. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds in the right lung base with no crackles.   Based on his presentation  an emergent contrast CT angiogram is requested which confirms the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection; Mr. Smith is scheduled for emergency surgery.
Aortic Dissection,2,90,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with excruciating  tearing chest pain that radiates to his upper back. The pain is described as acute onset  starting roughly 2 hours prior to presentation. He states that he has never experienced pain like this before. The patient looks anxious and uncomfortable.   His past medical history is significant for untreated hypertension and a smoking habit of 30 pack-years. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both parents suffering from coronary artery disease. He doesn't take any home medications  and has not been compliant with healthcare provider appointments or blood pressure readings.  Physical exam shows a blood pressure difference between the right and left arms  with right arm blood pressure higher than the left. His heart sounds are normal on auscultation but his pulses are weak in both lower extremities.   According to literature  the patient fits the demographic representation given his age  race  and gender. He also has several risk factors that make him more susceptible to aortic dissection  including long-standing hypertension  smoking history  and family history of cardiovascular disease.
Aortic Dissection,2,91,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that began about three hours ago. The pain is described as tearing and radiating to his back. Precipitating factors for this pain include a history of chronic uncontrolled hypertension. He also has a relevant history of a mild stroke two years ago  but no heart disease or diabetes is reported. He has a 15-pack year history of smoking  although he quit ten years ago. He is currently on anti-hypertensive medications and statins.  On examination  the patient appears anxious and in distress. He is pale  sweaty  and his blood pressure is markedly high at 190/110mmHg. His heart rate is irregular  possibly due to atrial fibrillation  and his oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. The patient states that this pain is unlike anything he's experienced before. He denies any nausea  vomiting  or dizziness. However  he reports some weakness in his left arm  which raises concerns about neurologic involvement.  He has no known drug allergies. He lives with his wife  and they have two adult children. He is a retired engineer  does light exercises few times a week  and diet is balanced but admits to high salt intake due to preference.  Given the acute onset chest pain  the high blood pressure  and the neurological symptoms  emergency investigations are initiated for a suspected aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,2,92,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Scott is a 60-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and smoking  who presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is unremitting and started abruptly about 2 hours ago. He also complains of shortness of breath.  On examination  he appears distressed and diaphoretic. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 184/98 mmHg  pulse 96 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and temperature 98.6 F. There is a discrepancy between the blood pressures in both arms. Initial ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy  but no evidence of acute ischemia. He reports no family history of connective tissue disorders or aortic diseases.  His lung sounds are clear and there is no pedal edema in legs. His pain is minimally relieved by opioid analgesics. His cardiac exam shows regular rate and rhythm  no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Neurological examination is normal.  Due to the high suspicion of aortic dissection  a stat computed tomography angiogram of the chest is ordered.   Background: A higher incidence of aortic dissection is observed among males  particularly African-American  who have a history of hypertension. Onset of disease typically occurs in the sixth and seventh decades of life. Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for aortic dissection. Other significant factors commonly seen in those who have suffered dissections include smoking  atherosclerosis  and pre-existing aortic aneurysm. 
Aortic Dissection,2,93,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 60-year-old Hispanic male presenting to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain. The pain is described as sharp and tearing  radiating to his back and has been persistent for a few hours. The patient appears uncomfortable and is profusely sweating.   Demographic Details: Mr. Rodriguez works as a construction worker and has a 30-year history of heavy smoking. He admits to drinking heavily during the weekends and has a diet high in sodium and cholesterol.   Past Medical History: His past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past decade. The patient was prescribed amlodipine 10mg daily but has low compliance to his medication regimen due to not understanding the importance of controlling his hypertension. He does not have any history of surgery or known allergies. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease and stroke  with both his father and brother suffering from heart attacks in their 60s  and a maternal uncle having a stroke.   The combination of his demographic details  lifestyle factors (heavy smoking and alcohol use  poor diet)  and significant family history are all potential risk factors that can predispose an individual to conditions like aortic dissection. His poorly controlled hypertension in particular  is a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. His symptoms  like severe chest pain and location of the pain  are consistent with typical presentations of patients with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,2,94,"Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. John Bell Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Taxi driver  Presenting Complaint:   Mr. Bell came into the emergency department complaining of a severe  sudden onset of chest pain that started about an hour ago. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  radiating from his chest to his back.    Past Medical History:  Mr. Bell has history of hypertension for the past 20 years  which is poorly controlled. He was diagnosed with atherosclerosis and also has a smoking history. He also mentions he has not been compliant with his hypertension medications.  Social history:  Mr. Bell is a divorced man living alone. He has two adult children whom he doesn't see often. He has been smoking for more than 30 years  about one pack a day  and occasionally drinks alcohol.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 68 due to a stroke and his mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes.  Review of Systems:  Positive for chest pain  shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and anxiety. Negative for nausea/vomiting  cough  fever  or a recent history of trauma or surgery.  Given the demographic data which shows increased prevalence of aortic dissection in African American males  the occupational stressors  historical data such as non-compliance to antihypertensive medications  long history of smoking and likely chronic hypertension  Mr. Bell fits the typical profile of a patient at high risk for aortic dissection. Emergency diagnostic tests such as aortic imaging and labs are needed to further assess and confirm the diagnosis."

She reports no allergies but is on treatment with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Her blood pressure on right arm is significantly higher than on left. She has family history of aortic dissection. Her temperature is 98.6°F  pulse 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute.  On physical examination  there is disparity in pulses and BP readings between right and left arm. Heart sounds are normal. The chest x-ray reveals a widened mediastinum. The EKG is normal  ruling out myocardial infarction. D-dimer levels are notably elevated. CT angiography is recommended for definitive diagnosis.  The presenting signs and symptoms in conjunction with the history and physical findings raise suspicion for an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,2,98,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department with abrupt severe chest pain. His pain began suddenly over the past 30-45 minutes  and he describes it as ripping or tearing that radiates to his back. He additionally reports associated cold sweats  feeling lightheaded and some shortness of breath but no nausea  vomiting or palpitations.   Upon further questioning  Mr. Jones reveals that he's a smoker with a 40-pack year history and also occasionally uses cocaine. His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled hypertension for the past 20 years  for which he takes Lisinopril. He also has a family history of aortic aneurysm as his father suffered from it in the past. He does not take any other medications or have any known allergies.  On physical examination  the patient was found to be in moderate distress due to pain. His blood pressure was significantly higher on the right arm compared to the left arm. There was a delay in the femoral pulse compared to the brachial pulse  suggestive of pulse differential.   Given his symptoms  past medical history  and physical exam findings  the possibility of aortic dissection was strongly considered and further diagnostic strategies were planned accordingly to confirm the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,2,99,Patient Presentation:  Mr. AG is a 62-year-old African American male  presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe tearing chest pain radiating towards the back.

Aortic Dissection,3,2,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection Dealing With Diverse Demography  Slide 1: Introduction  - Age: 60 years old.  - Gender: Male.  - Ethnicity: African-American. Studies show that males are twice as likely to have aortic dissections. It's also more common in the late-middle-aged population. African-Americans are at a higher risk compared to their Caucasian counterparts.  Slide 2: Past Medical History   - History of hypertension.  - History of smoking.  - Previously diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Majority of aortic dissection cases have a history of hypertension. Smoking can induce hypertension and damage blood vessels. Additionally  patients with connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome are at a higher risk.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints  - Sudden severe chest pain.  - Pain radiating to the back.  - Shortness of breath.   Slide 4: Physical Examination and Symptoms  - Discrepancy in blood pressure between two arms.  - Pulse asymmetry.  - Signs of shock such as paleness  sweating  rapid heartbeat.  - Signs of possible organ damage.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Investigations  - Chest X-ray: it might show widened mediastinum.  - CT angiogram and/or MRI angiogram: For confirmation of aortic dissection.  - Transthoracic Echocardiography or Trans-esophageal Echocardiography: To visualize the heart.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan  - Blood pressure and heart rate control: via beta-blockers and other medications.  - Pain management: via narcotics.  - In some cases  surgery or endovascular repair may be required  depending on the type and extent of dissection.  Slide 7: Prognosis  - Can vary significantly; depends on age  severity of the condition  patient's overall health and quickness of the diagnosis and appropriate treatment initiation.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Aortic dissection is a serious condition requiring prompt diagnosis and individualized  aggressive treatment with full consideration of the patient's demographic characteristics and past medical history. Early detection and coordinated medical care can directly impact the prognosis and long-term survival of these patients.

Aortic Dissection,3,4,Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection  SLIDE 1: Title: Introduction  Body: Today  we'll be exploring a case of a patient with aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. It predominantly affects men  with a 2:1 male:female ratio  and typically occurs in individuals aged 60-70.  SLIDE 2: Title: Patient Demographics & Past Medical History  Body: Patient: Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old African American male. Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has history of uncontrolled hypertension  a predisposing risk factor to aortic dissection. He also has a family history of heart diseases.  SLIDE 3: Title: Presenting Symptoms   Body: Mr. Smith presented to the ER with a sudden onset of severe chest pain described as ‘tearing’ and migrating from his chest through to his back. He also reported shortness of breath and upper body discomfort.   SLIDE 4: Title: Clinical Assessment   Body: Physical examination revealed an early diastolic murmur  weak pulses in the left arm and blood pressure differences in both arms.  SLIDE 5:  Title: Diagnostic Investigations  Body: A chest X-ray showed an enlarged mediastinum. A subsequent trans-esophageal echocardiogram confirmed an intimal flap  consistent with Type A (ascending) aortic dissection. Laboratory tests revealed elevated D-Dimer and cardiac enzymes.   SLIDE 6: Title: Treatment Plan   Body: Mr. Smith was immediately started on beta-blockers and intravenous nitroprusside to control his blood pressure. Following stabilization  he underwent successful emergency surgical repair of his ascending aorta.   SLIDE 7: Title: Outlook and Aftercare  Body: Post-surgery  extensive follow-ups with cardiology and primary care providers will be essential to monitor for complications. This includes monitoring blood pressure and adjusting medications as necessary  lifestyle modification advice particularly about hypertension management.  SLIDE 8: Title: Conclusion   Body: Aortic dissection is a medical emergency that requires a high index of suspicion and prompt treatment to increase survival. The risk is especially high in older males with a history of uncontrolled hypertension. Regular follow-ups post-treatment are essential for a patient's recovery and preventing recurrence.  The objective of this presentation was to increase our awareness of this potentially lethal condition and the importance of early diagnosis and management. 
Aortic Dissection,3,5,"Title: Understanding Aortic Dissection Through a Patient Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction A brief review of aortic dissection  a serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta  the large blood vessel branching off the heart  tears. The force of blood surges through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to dissect or separate.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Now  let's introduce our patient  """"Mr. X"""". He is a 65-year-old African-American male  as studies show that African-American males over 60 years of age exhibit higher incidence rates of aortic dissection.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History Mr. X has a past medical history of: 1. Hypertension: a common significant risk factor for aortic dissection. Mr. X has been dealing with uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years. 2. Smoking: Mr. X was a heavy smoker for three decades  increasing the risk of aortic dissection 3. Bicuspid Aortic Valve: a congenital heart disease also associated with this condition.  Slide 4: Symptoms Mr. X was admitted to ER with symptoms like severe chest pain migrating to the back  sweating  nausea  dizziness  and fainting – symptoms typically seen in patients with acute aortic dissections.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Upon physical examination  variations in pulses and blood pressures in his upper extremities led the physician to suspect aortic dissection. Various diagnostic tools  such as transthoracic echocardiography  computerized tomography (CT)  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and aortography can be used  Mr. X's diagnosis was confirmed with a CT scan showing an intimal flap and the true and false lumens.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment Treatment depends on where the aortic dissection is located (Type A or B) and the patient's overall condition. For Mr. X  who had a Type A aortic dissection  emergency surgery was necessary to repair the torn aorta.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Patient Education Following a successful surgical intervention  Mr. X was strongly advised to manage his blood pressure. Long-term close follow-ups are required to detect any future complications early. He was also educated about the importance of adhering to a healthy diet  regular exercise  and a strict no-smoking policy to reduce other cardiovascular risks.   Slide 8: Conclusion Through Mr. X's case  we understand the potential severity of aortic dissection  the importance of prompt diagnosis  and immediate treatment. We also recognise the importance of managing predisposing factors  such as hypertension and atherosclerosis  to prevent this life-threatening condition."
Aortic Dissection,3,6,Title: A Typical Case of Aortic Disection Amidst Racial Disparity  Slide 1: Case Introduction  Our case involves a 69-year-old African American male presenting with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient has a past medical history of mild hypertension and smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily. He also has a modest degree of obesity (BMI: 30.5).  Slide 2: Demographic Considerations  As per the literature  aortic dissection incidence is higher in males  with the median onset age of 63-72 years. African American males are reportedly at a higher risk than their Caucasian counterparts  potentially owing to  amongst other factors  a higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension in this demographic.  Slide 3: Patient's History and Presentation  The patient’s past medical history reveals mild hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. Smoking and obesity add to the overall cardiovascular risk. His symptoms of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back are characteristic of type A aortic dissection.   Slide 4: Diagnostic procedures  Considering the patient’s historical symptoms  presentation  and risk factors  immediate diagnostic procedures such as a CT angiogram or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed.   Slide 5: Treatment Plan   Our approach would involve immediate surgical repair given the suspected diagnosis of type A aortic dissection. Postoperative care is crucial and should involve strict blood pressure control  modifying risk factors (assisting the patient in smoking cessation)  and regular imaging follow-up.   Slide 6: Conclusion  This clinical case demonstrates the effect of racial disparities on healthcare outcomes. The higher incidence of aortic dissection in African American males highlights the need for more intensive primary prevention efforts focused on better hypertension control in this demographic.  Slide 7: Questions and Discussion  Now we can open up the floor to specific questions and discussion about the case  its diagnostic challenges  treatment options  and the importance of addressing racial disparities in healthcare.
Aortic Dissection,3,7,Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Review  Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we'll investigate a case involving aortic dissection  a severe condition resulting in the inner layer of the aorta tearing. This case involves a 65-year-old African American male. Studies show that this condition is more common in males over 60  with a heightened incidence in the African American population.  Slide 2: Patient Characteristics  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a retired construction worker. He has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  a smoking habit of 30 years  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. All these risk factors line up with the demographics most susceptible to aortic dissection  creating a critical conversation about prevention strategies.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia ten years ago. However  there's been a pattern of irregularity in taking his prescribed medication. Recently  he has experienced recurrent episodes of chest pain  disregarded as indigestion.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Smith presented with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. Despite his initial belief that his discomfort came from indigestion  the magnitude of the pain led him to seek immediate medical attention. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and a sense of impending doom.  Slide 5: Initial Diagnosis & Management  Given the severity of Mr Smith's discomfort  coupled with his medical history and demographics  the onset of an aortic dissection was suspected. An immediate CT was ordered  confirming an aortic dissection. Blood pressure control was started immediately using intravenous antihypertensives  and a cardiothoracic surgery consultation was sought.  Slide 6: Discussion   Recognizing aortic dissection in patients can be challenging due to symptom overlap with other cardiovascular conditions like myocardial infarction. However  attention to risk factors such as hypertension  smoking  hypercholesterolemia  age  gender  and race can be crucial in guiding medical decision-making in emergency settings.   Slide 7: Key Takeaways  Early suspicion and intervention in aortic dissection cases can be a lifesaver. As healthcare providers  knowledge of characteristic features  risk populations  potential disguise of symptoms  and necessary aggressive management interventions can bring significant differences in patient outcomes.  Slide 8: Questions and Comments  This case raises numerous topics for discussion. Are there questions or comments about diagnosis  patient management  or any other issues related to the clinical presentation of aortic dissection?

Aortic Dissection,3,10,Title: A Case Study of Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Introduction Today  we'll be discussing a case of aortic dissection. This case will help us understand the risk factors  classic presentations  and potential complications of the ailment.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Bob  from a semi-urban area. Aortic Dissection generally is more prevalent in males around this age  especially those who are Black or Caucasian.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Bob's medical history reveals hypertension for the past ten years and a tobacco usage history. Both are significant risk factors for aortic dissection according to literature. Bob has been under medication for his hypertension but admits his compliance to prescribed medication and lifestyle modification was subpar.  Slide 4: Current Presentation Bob presented with sudden severe  tearing upper back pain that radiated to his chest  followed by shortness of breath—an archetypal symptom of aortic dissection. Bob also exhibited mild lower limb weakness on physical examination.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests A Chest X-ray was done revealing a widened mediastinum. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography and CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection  involving the ascending aorta and arch.  Slide 6: Management  Bob underwent immediate surgical intervention due to the high risk of rupture associated with ascending aorta involvement. His hypertension was managed aggressively post-surgery to avoid further complications.  Slide 7: Follow-Up and Prognosis  Bob's condition improved post-surgery but required long-term follow-up and aggressive control of his hypertension. He was also advised for smoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case study exemplifies the importance of a proper and timely diagnosis of aortic dissection and highlights the clinical urgency the condition demands due to its potentially fatal complications.  Slide 9: Take Home Message This case of aortic dissection reiterates the need for medical practitioners to maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for any patient presenting with acute severe chest or back pain - especially in hypertensive patients like Bob.

He presents with mild dyspnea  transient loss of consciousness  and perspiration. He has not previously experienced such symptoms.  Slide 2:  Past Medical History: Mr. X’s medical history includes hypertension diagnosed at the age of 45  which has been poorly controlled. He is a lifelong smoker of approximately one pack a day for 40 years. He had myocardial infarction 5 years ago but no other known heart conditions. Mr. X was found positive for type II diabetes a year ago and is under medication.  Slide 3:  Significantly Increased Risk Factors: Given his demographic group and past medical history  Mr. X falls into a higher risk category for aortic dissection:  1. Age: Incidence of aortic dissection tends to increase with age. It is most common in patients aged 50-70 years. 2. Race: Studies have indicated an increased prevalence of aortic dissection in African Americans compared to other racial groups. 3. Hypertension: The patient's long-term poorly controlled hypertension exponentially augments the risk of aortic dissection. 4. Smoking: Mr. X's decades-long history of tobacco usage compounds the risk further. 5. Previous myocardial infarction and type II diabetes: These conditions intensify cardiovascular and overall health risks.  Slide 4: Aortic Dissection Diagnosis: Given the presenting symptoms  clinical examination  and medical and social history  an aortic dissection is suspected. An emergency contrast-enhanced CT scan is ordered  confirming the diagnosis of a Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Management and Further Steps: The patient is immediately stabilized with intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside  to control heart rate and blood pressure. Due to the type of dissection  emergent surgical repair is planned. He is also advised for a smoking cessation program and educated about the importance of regular monitoring and control of his blood pressure and diabetes to prevent long-term complications.  Slide 6: Conclusion: Early recognition of aortic dissection is critical due to its high morbidity and mortality rate. A high index of suspicion is required especially in patients like Mr. X who belong to high-risk groups due to age  race  hypertension  and tobacco usage. A swift diagnosis followed by appropriate intervention can significantly increase survival rates.

Aortic Dissection,3,13,"Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction and Demographics Patient Profile: Caucasian male  60 years old. Our subject is a representative of the most common demographic impacted by aortic dissections - men between 60-70 years of age. Aortic dissection is more prevalent amongst males  with a 2:1 ratio compared to females  and Caucasians are reported to have a higher incidence rate.  Slide 2: Background and Past Medical History • History of smoking: Our patient is a former smoker  with a 30 pack/year history. Smoking is a key risk factor for aortic dissection due to its impact on vascular health. • Hypertension: The patient has managed hypertension  a crucial risk factor as it can exert excessive pressure on the arterial wall  leading to dissection. • High cholesterol: High LDL levels have been noted in his medical records  symbolizing a risk of atherosclerosis.  Slide 3: Presentation and Symptoms The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden and severe """"tearing"""" chest pain that radiated to his back. More symptoms included shortness of breath  clammy skin  nausea  lower extremity weakness and a slight difference in blood pressure between arms.  Slide 4: Diagnosis A thorough physical examination was complemented by imaging studies. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was used to confirm an acute Stanford Type B aortic dissection  demonstrating an intimal flap starting from just distal to the left subclavian artery and propagating to the iliac arteries.  Slide 5: Management and Treatment Treatment focused on blood pressure control to reduce aortic shear stress. Intravenous beta-blockers administered initially  followed by Sodium nitroprusside to manage hypertension. The patient avoided surgery due to the location of the dissection (distal to the subclavian artery) and was put on a regimen of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers for long-term blood pressure control.   Slide 6: Follow-Up and Prognosis The patient is scheduled for repeated imaging studies to monitor the dissection. With proper management  his prognosis is hopeful but he is counseled on lifestyle changes (low sodium diet  regular exercise  and smoking cessation) to prevent exacerbation or recurrence.   Slide 7: Summary This case highlights the classically described Stanford Type B aortic dissection in an at-risk patient - a Caucasian  60-year-old male with history of smoking  hypertension  and high cholesterol. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the patient outcomes. This case emphasizes the need for regulated blood pressure control and lifestyle modifications amongst high-risk individuals.

Aortic Dissection,3,20,Slide 1: Introduction  Patient X is a 65-year-old African American male presenting with sudden intense chest pain - a classic scenario of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection most commonly affects males in their sixties and seventies. Furthermore  African Americans have a 50% higher mortality rate from aortic dissection compared to Caucasians  making prompt diagnosis crucial.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mr. X has a notable history of untreated hypertension for the last ten years - the leading risk factor for aortic dissection which accounts for approximately 72% of cases. He also has a smoking history of 20 years.   Slide 3: Familial History  He has no family history of aortic dissection  Marfan Syndrome  Loeys-Dietz Syndrome  Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome or common genetic mutations that could increase the risk of aortic dissection. However  he does have a paternal history of heart disease.  Slide 4: Presentation & Symptoms  Today  Mr. X arrived to the ER complaining about a sudden and tremendous back and chest pain that seemed to radiate to his abdomen. He also felt weakness in his left leg. These symptoms often suggest aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Measures  Due to his symptoms and past medical history  an immediate Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scan was ordered.   Slide 6: CTA Findings  The CTA demonstrated a dissection beginning just after the left subclavian artery and extending into the iliac arteries  indicating a Stanford type B aortic dissection.  Slide 7: Treatment  Given the patient’s Stanford Type B dissection  he was initially managed medically with beta-blockers  aiming for a heart rate of 60-70 bpm and systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mm Hg. The cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted for potential surgical intervention.  Slide 8: Takeaway   This case shows the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with sudden severe chest or back pain  especially in older males with hypertension. Aggressive control of blood pressure and heart rate can reduce the propagation of the dissection and mortality.
Aortic Dissection,3,21,Title: A Case Study of Aortic Dissection   Slide 1: Introduction - Definition: Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the aorta  the major artery carrying blood from the heart to the body  leading to life-threatening complications if untreated.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient X is a 70-year-old Caucasian man  reflecting the demographic most commonly affected by this condition as per medical literature. - Approximately 60% of patients with aortic dissection are men  andthe median age at presentation is 63 years for men and 67 years for women.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - Patient X has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  one of the main risk factors for aortic dissection. - Other common risk factors include conditions that cause damage to the aorta  such as Marfan syndrome  trauma to the chest  atherosclerosis  congenital heart conditions  etc.   Slide 4: Symptoms and Presentation  - Patient X presented symptoms that include severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting. Both abrupt  severe pain in the chest or upper back and sudden difficulty in breathing are common symptoms in cases of aortic dissection. - Less common symptoms can include sudden difficulty speaking  loss of vision  weakness on one side of the body  or paralysis.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation - Diagnostics performed included a CT Scan and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection. - Additional diagnostics may include an MRI or an Aortography  though TEE and CT scan are the ly first choices due to their accuracy and accessibility.  Slide 6: Treatment  - Immediate hospitalization was arranged for Patient X. Treatment depends on the location of the tear. - Patient X's tear was in the ascending aorta (Type A Dissection). This is treated surgically. - For descending aorta tears  non-surgical treatment may be possible  but this would depend on the specific condition of the patient.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Prevention - Mortality rate for untreated aortic dissection is extremely high (Type A: 1-2% per hour following the onset of symptoms).  - Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. - Prevention focuses on controlling hypertension  cessation of smoking  and addressing other cardiovascular risk factors.  Slide 8: Conclusion  - Although aortic dissection is relatively rare  it's often fatal  stressing the necessity for quick diagnosis and treatment. - Further research is necessary to better understand the causes of aortic dissection and improve treatments  thus improving survival rates for patients like Mr. X.

Aortic Dissection,3,24,Slide 1: Introduction Aortic dissection is a rare  but life-threatening condition mostly affecting older men  with the ages ranging from 63-70. The lifetime risk appears to be twice as high in men than women. It predominantly affects individuals with chronic hypertension and is also related to smoking and various connective tissue diseases.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Today  we'll be discussing a case of an African American male patient  aged 65  with a history of chronic hypertension and tobacco use. African Americans have discrepantly higher rates of hypertension  which indirectly puts them at a higher risk of aortic dissection.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a 20-year history of hypertension that was inconsistently managed due to a lack of access to consistent healthcare. Additionally  he has a 30-pack-year history of smoking  but has been tobacco-free for the last 10 years. No record of connective tissue disease.  Slide 4: Diagnosis  The patient was admitted to the emergency department with severe chest pain  rated 10/10  radiating to his back  and was diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection based on transthoracic echocardiography and confirmed with a CT angiogram.  Slide 5: Management & Outcome He underwent emergency surgery to repair the dissecting aneurysm. His postoperative period was marked by a pleural effusion and transient renal impairment  which resolved with treatment. He was discharged with medication for blood pressure control and cessation of his nicotine dependence.  Slide 6: Prognosis With the surgical intervention  the immediate life-threat was managed. Prognosis will depend on patient's adherence to his antihypertensive medication and avoidance of tobacco use. Regular follow-ups are crucial to monitor his blood pressure and overall cardiac health.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case underlines the crucial role of hypertension and smoking as risk factors for aortic dissection. It emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis  intermediate surgical treatment  and the necessity of long-term management strategies to prevent deadly complications. Increased awareness can lead to improved outcomes and survival rates in patients with aortic dislocation.    Reference: 1. Mussa FF  Horton JD  Moridzadeh R  et al.

Aortic Dissection,3,25,"Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction The focus of this presentation is a case of aortic dissection  a severe condition characterized by a tear in the wall of the aorta  the largest blood vessel branching off the heart.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  reflective of trends in demographic data suggesting the highest incidence rates of aortic dissection are found amongst men in their sixth and seventh decades of life  with a higher proportion reported in the Caucasian race.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient  Mr. B  has a significant medical history of marked hypertension  which is commonly associated with aortic dissection. He suffered myocardial infarction 2 years ago  is a half-pack a day smoker and has low adherence to his antihypertensive medication. These are prudent risk factors that can precipitate aortic dissection.  Slide 4: Presentation & Symptoms Mr. B presented to the emergency department with sudden severe pain in the anterior chest and back  with pain radiating to the abdomen. The pain was described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping """" which are classic descriptions for aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  Confirmatory diagnosis was achieved by computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  showing the presence of an intimal flap in the aorta  a conclusive radiological sign of aortic dissection. An electrocardiogram ruled out any ongoing ischemic disease.   Slide 6: Management  Management involved immediate blood pressure control with intravenous beta-blockers to reduce shear stress. This was followed by surgical consultation  an integral part of treatment for Stanford type A aortic dissection  as it involves the ascending aorta.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of a potentially fatal condition like aortic dissection. It reminds us to constantly evaluate patients with a history of hypertension  smoking  or ischemic heart disease presenting with severe undifferentiated chest and abdominal pain for aortic dissection. Furthermore  it highlights the significance of ensuring strict blood pressure control in these high-risk patients."
Aortic Dissection,3,26,Title: Aortic Dissection Case Presentation  Slide 1: Case Introduction - Patient: 65-year-old African American male presents with chest pain. - Primary Presenting Concern: Reports sudden onset of severe  sharp  stabbing chest pain radiating to the back lasting for several hours.   Slide 2: Past Medical History - Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 45  not regularly medicated. - Cigarette Smoking: A pack a day for the past 40 years. - Cholesterol: Borderline high cholesterol levels.  Slide 3: Demographics and Prevalence  According to the literature  aortic dissections are more common in males (in about 65% of cases)  especially over the age of 60. Moreover  they are reported to be two to three times more common in the African American population - an important factor in this case. Chronic hypertension and smoking are among key risk factors.  Slide 4: Examination Findings  - Pulse Abnormality: Blood pressure and pulse differential between the two arms.  - Cardiac Auscultation: Diastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Investigations  - ECG: No evidence of myocardial infarction  but nonspecific ST-T changes found. - Chest X-ray: Shows widened mediastinum. - CT angiogram: Confirms aortic dissection  suggesting a Stanford Type A aortic dissection  involving the ascending aorta.  Slide 6: Management  - Immediate Management: Admission to ICU  aggressive blood pressure control using IV Beta-Blockers and Nitroprusside. - Definitive Treatment: Given the involvement of ascending aorta  an emergency surgical repair is indicated.  Slide 7: Potential Complications  Without immediate surgery  there is an increased risk of aortic rupture  organ damage  and even death due to inadequate blood flow.  Slide 8: Prognosis and Long-term Management  Post-surgery  the focus will be on long-term hypertension control  smoking cessation support  and a healthy lifestyle. The patient would require regular monitoring for potential late complications like aortic dilation or recurrent dissection.  Slide 9: Learning Points  Aortic dissection should always be considered in differential diagnoses for patients complaining of sharp  sudden chest pain  especially in hypertensive  elderly males  and African American populations. Immediate evaluation and intervention are pivotal to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Aortic Dissection,3,27,Slide 1:  Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection   Slide 2:  Title: Demographics Content: Aortic dissection predominantly affects older individuals  with an average patient age of 63 years. It is more commonly seen in males  with a 2:1 ratio relative to females. While there is no significant racial predilection  studies show that black populations may be at a slightly higher risk for aortic dissection.   Slide 3: Title: Case Overview Content: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male presenting with sudden-onset severe chest pain radiating to the back. He has a history of high blood pressure and smoking  which he quit 10 years ago. He also reported shortness of breath and abdominal pain.  Slide 4: Title: Past Medical History Content: The patient reports having a history of hypertension which had been managed with prescribed medication. He has been a non-smoker for the past decade but had a 30-year history of heavy smoking. There is no known history of heart diseases  diabetes  or other major medical conditions.   Slide 5: Title: Risk Factors Content: Apart from age and gender  the most significant risk factor in our patient is hypertension. The history of smoking may also have contributed despite cessation 10 years ago. Additional risk factors that can predispose individuals to aortic dissection include connective tissue disorders  cocaine use  weightlifting  and family history. All of these were negative in our patient.  Slide 6:  Title: Conclusion Content: Early diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection improve the prognosis significantly. This case underlines the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients  particularly older hypertensive males  who present with sudden severe chest or back pain.   References: 1.

Aortic Dissection,3,28,"Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Study  Slide 1: Patient Demographics - Patient: 65-year-old African-American male. - Occupation: Retired firefighter. - Socioeconomic status: Middle class. - Family status: Married  with 3 adult children.  Note: Numerous studies have found a higher prevalence of aortic dissection in males and the aging population. Also  African-American individuals have shown an increased risk due to hypertension.   Slide 2: Past Medical History - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. Medication non-compliance reported. - Hyperlipidemia. - History of tobacco use  having quit 5 years ago after a 30-year pack/day habit. - No history of diabetes or other chronic diseases.  Note: Hypertension is often associated with aortic dissection  with 75-80% of patients diagnosed with an aortic dissection having a history of hypertension. Similarly  hyperlipidemia and smoking contribute to vascular disease  increasing the risk of aortic dissection.  Slide 3: Presentation - Presenting complaints: Sudden onset of severe chest pain  described as """"tearing"""" and """"sharp""""  radiating to the back. - Other symptoms: Profuse sweating  nausea  and mild breathlessness. - Initial vital signs: Blood pressure 180/110 mmHg. Heart rate 98 beats/min.  Slide 4: Diagnosis and Management - Sudden severe pain  hypertension  and the patient's history strongly suggest aortic dissection. - Fast-tracked for Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)  confirming Stanford Type B aortic dissection. - Managed initially via blood pressure control (via IV beta-blockers and vasodilators)  pain management  and close monitoring in the ICU. - Further evaluation by cardiothoracic surgery for potential intervention.  This case demonstrates the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis for patients with sudden  severe chest pain  especially in older males with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Collaborative  multidisciplinary management is crucial for optimal outcomes."
Aortic Dissection,3,29,"Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Case Introduction: The patient in question  Mr. Jackson  is a high-risk demographic for aortic dissection  as he is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension and smoking.  Demographics: According to the literature  aortic dissection tends to affect middle-aged and older individuals with a median age at presentation of 63 years. There is also a significant sex and race disparity in the prevalence of this condition. Males are twice as likely to be affected as females  and the condition is more prevalent among African Americans compared to Caucasians.  Medical History: Mr. Jackson has a 20-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years before quitting 15 years ago. Both are major predisposing factors for aortic dissection. The prolonged high blood pressure could have damaged and weakened the walls of the patient's aorta  augmenting the risk of a dissection. The smoking history could have contributed to the development of an atherosclerosis  further compromising the integrity of the aortic wall.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Jackson presented to the emergency department reporting severe chest pain radiating to his back. The sudden and """"ripping"""" nature of the pain  coupled with his risk factors  raised immediate concern for aortic dissection.  Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination  a discrepancy was noted in peripheral pulses and a systolic blood pressure difference of more than 20 mmHg between his right and left arms. Both these findings are considered clinical features indicative of aortic dissection.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Echocardiography and CT angiogram were ordered. The tests revealed an intimal flap in the descending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of aortic dissection (Stanford type B).  Management Plan: As it was a Stanford type B dissection  he was managed medically with drugs to lower his blood pressure and heart rate to reduce the aortic wall stress. Given the patient’s smoking history and poorly controlled hypertension  he was also enrolled in a smoking cessation and hypertension awareness program.  In conclusion  Mr. Jackson's case typifies the typical demographic and risk factors association with aortic dissection - male  over 60  African American  hypertensive  and a former smoker. His case exemplifies the clinical presentation and diagnostic challenges of this severe and often fatal condition. It underlines the importance of comprehensive management  involving immediate medical treatment coupled with long-term lifestyle modification.   References: 1. Elefteriades  J. A. (2002).

Aortic Dissection,3,30,"Title: Aortic Dissection Case Study  Slide 1 - Introduction:  Aortic dissection affects approximately 5-30 people per million per year. It predominantly affects males over the age of 60. In this health case presentation  we'll discuss Mr.Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male  representing a demographic group at high risk for aortic dissection.  Slide 2 - Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension for the past ten years which is quite common among patients with aortic dissection as high blood pressure can lead to a stress on the aortic wall. He is also a smoker with a 40 pack-year history  worsening his hypertension. His father died at 55 due to an aortic aneurysm  indicating potential genetic predisposition.   Slide 3 - Presenting Concerns: He visited the emergency department complaining of abrupt  severe chest pain which he described as """"tearing"""" starting from the front of his chest moving towards his back. His blood pressure presented significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left  indicating possible vascular involvement.  Slide 4 - Diagnosis: A portable chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening and a CT angiogram confirmed the aortic dissection  starting just above the aortic valve and extending distally to the abdominal aorta. It was classified as a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Slide 5 - Treatment and Management: Mr. Johnson was immediately referred for surgical treatment considering his Stanford Type A classification demanding emergency surgery. His hypertension is being managed with IV beta-blockers to lower blood pressure and reduce the force of heart contraction. Following surgery  he'll have to continue medication and lifestyle adjustments  specifically targeted at managing his hypertension and smoking cessation.  Slide 6 - Conclusion: This case exemplifies the typical presentation and risks associated with aortic dissection  stressing the importance of immediate recognition and treatment given its high mortality rate. It's crucial to educate at-risk populations  especially hypertensive males over 60  on the importance of regular checkups and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.   Slide 7 - References: (Evidence-based data sources regarding aortic dissection and its epidemiology)  Notes to keep in mind: The case study is an illustrative example of aortic dissection with a focus on high-risk demographic representation  not all cases may present the same way. The treatment plan would vary based on the individual patient's health condition  type of aortic dissection  and other associated factors."
Aortic Dissection,3,31,Title: Aortic Dissection: A Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  The subject for this case study is a chronic condition known as aortic dissection  which involves a tear in the lining of the aorta  prompting blood to surge through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to dissect or separate.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year old African American male  presenting to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe chest pain. This demographic is not chosen at random; research shows that aortic dissection has a higher prevalence in males and within older age groups  with African Americans experiencing a higher rate of incidence compared to other ethnicities.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Our patient has a robust history of controlled hypertension  which is the most common risk factor associated with aortic dissection. He also has a 10-year history of smoking; however  he quit five years ago. Additional history includes hyperlipidemia and family history of cardiovascular disorders.   Slide 4: Initial Presentation  Upon presentation  the patient complained of a tearing sensation in his chest. Sudden chest or upper back pain  often described as a tearing  ripping or shearing sensation  that radiates to the neck or down the back  is a classic symptom of aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Clinical Evaluation  Initial physical examination revealed hypertension and a pulse differential between both arms. Auscultation might expose a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency  a common complication of aortic dissection. His EKG showed no signs of myocardial infarction.  Slide 6: Imaging and Diagnosis  An immediate CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection  extending from the ascending aorta down to the iliac arteries. This acute aortic dissection requires emergent surgical consultation.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case underscores that classic presentation  high index of suspicion  and immediate diagnostic imaging are critical for the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition.

Aortic Dissection,3,34,Title: Management of Acortic Dissection: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  An overview of aortic dissection - a severe condition characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  which allows blood to surge through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers to separate (dissect).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Presenting a 65-year-old African-American male  retired  with a documented higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases compared to other ethnicities. Data suggests that aortic dissection is relatively common in males and patients over 60 years of age  and African-Americans have a higher rate of hypertensive disorders leading to associated cardiovascular complications compared to their Caucasian counterparts.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Our patient has a past medical history significant for chronic uncontrolled hypertension  a known risk factor of aortic dissection. He is also a former smoker and has high cholesterol levels  both contributing to arterial wall damage and atherosclerosis. There is no relevant surgical history.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptomatology  Complaints include sudden  severe “stabbing” chest pain radiating to his back. He also reports profuse sweating and mild shortness of breath  typical symptoms accompanying aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Examination and Investigation Results  Physical examination reveals high blood pressure and a weak pulse in one arm. An imaging test (CT scan) indicates the presence of an aortic dissection  and an EKG eliminates myocardial infarction as a differential diagnosis.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment Plan  We initiated beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure  pulse rate  and myocardial oxygen demand. We also implemented pain management. Given his complicated hypertension and large extent aortic dissection  the patient underwent surgical intervention to repair the torn aorta.   Slide 7: Prognosis & Follow Up  Post-surgery  the patient was moved to intensive care for close monitoring. The prognosis will largely depend on how promptly the patient was treated and his overall health. Follow-ups will aim to manage cardiovascular risk factors effectively  particularly hypertension.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case study underscores the importance of optimal management of cardiovascular risk factors  particularly in high-risk demographic groups  to prevent serious complications such as aortic dissection.    Slide 9: References  A list of publications  books  and online resources where the data for the case study was sourced. The resources are in APA or MLA format.   Slide 10: Q&A Time for attendees to ask any questions or provide insights regarding the case presented.
Aortic Dissection,3,35,"Title: Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient   Slide 1: Introduction We gather today to discuss a recent case of a 68-year-old African American male individual who presented with aortic dissection. This representation reflects the demographic group most commonly affected.  Slide 2: Demographics and Risk Factors Statistically  aortic dissection has a higher prevalence among males  particularly those of African American descent  like our patient. Advanced age  typically above 60  and hypertension are significant risk factors  both of which are applicable to this patient.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient had a long history of uncontrolled hypertension for over 20 years. Additionally  he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic condition associated with aortic root dilation  increasing his vulnerability for an aortic event.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient presented with a sudden  intense chest pain that radiated to his back  typical of aortic dissection. The pain was described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping """" which started at the center of his chest and spread to the back.   Slide 5: Examination and Diagnosis On arrival  his blood pressure varied significantly between his arms. Auscultation of the chest indicated a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Imaging studies  including a CT scan and transesophageal echocardiography  confirmed an ascending aortic dissection.  Slide 6: Treatment and Outcome The patient underwent immediate surgery for his type A aortic dissection in order to prevent fatal complications. His postoperative period was complicated by transient acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis  but he eventually recovered and was discharged with intensive hypertension management advice.  Slide 7: Conclusion With rapidly aging global populations  aortic dissection cases are likely to increase. It's crucial to have a high index of suspicion  early diagnosis  and appropriate management  especially in high-risk groups  to prevent devastating outcomes.

Aortic Dissection,3,37,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Introduction  The following case study provides an insight into Aortic Dissection  a serious and life-threatening cardiovascular condition. It is predominantly prevalent in males who are aged between 60-70 years and has a significant correlation with hypertension.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mr. S  is a 64-year-old Caucasian male from a rural community. Mr. S is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking 20 years ago but still has a 20 pack-year history. He is also a retired truck driver and currently lives with his wife.  Slide 3: Pre-existing Medical Conditions  Mr. S has been managing a history of controlled hypertension (stage 2) for over a decade now with the help of medications. He is otherwise in an average health condition  with no known cases of diabetes  high-cholesterol levels  or a family history of any heart diseases.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  He visited a local ER department with complaints of severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating towards his back  shortness of breath  profuse sweating  light-headedness  and nausea — classic symptoms indicative of an aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests  Physical examination revealed an early diastolic murmur  indicative of aortic regurgitation. CT angiogram confirmed an acute type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the level of the renal arteries. The ECG showed no ischemic changes.  Slide 6: Management Plan  Mr. S was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure and heart rate. He was promptly referred for emergency open aortic surgery  considering the type A dissection and severity of his symptoms.  Slide 7: Prognosis  Prognosis in such cases is highly dependent on early detection and surgical intervention. Studies have shown a 30-day mortality rate of approximately 25% following surgical repair  with the rate being highest in elderly patients with existing comorbidities.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of early detection and prompt surgical management of aortic dissections. The regular check-up and management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension are vital in the prevention of such severe cardiovascular diseases.

Aortic Dissection,3,47,Slide 1: Title: Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection   Slide 2: Introduction So  let's talk about Mr. Smith today. He is a 60-year-old African American male engineer  smoker  presenting with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. This demographic with its associated risk factors is often seen with aortic dissection cases.   Slide 3: Background of the Symptomatology Aortic dissection is a severe condition where the inner layer of the aorta  the major blood vessel branching out from the heart  tears. Blood gushes through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to dissect (part).  Slide 4: Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of hypertension  which he is controlling with medication. His family history reveals instances of heart disease.  Slide 5: Risk Factors In line with our patient's profile  risk factors in most cases include high blood pressure (around 72%)  male sex (up to 65% of incidences)  age 50-70  and certain genetic conditions affecting connective tissue like Marfan syndrome. Our patient's chronic smoking habit is another notably significant risk factor.  Slide 6: Symptoms  Mr. Smith described his pain as 'sharp'  'tearing'  and 'ripping'. Pain of this nature  severe in intensity and acute in onset  is a typical symptom of aortic dissection. Smith also reported feeling anxious and having a faint pulse.  Slide 7: Diagnosis Given the symptoms and risk factors presented by Mr. Smith  a CT scan was immediately recommended. The scan confirmed the dissection of his aorta.  Slide 8: Treatment Plan The emergency nature of aortic dissection necessitated immediate action. Mr. Smith was given blood pressure lowering drugs to decrease the strain on the aortic wall. Given the type and location of the dissection  a surgical management plan was deemed most suitable.   Slide 9: Prognosis and Follow-up We are expecting a positive surgical and recovery outcome for Mr. Smith. Follow-ups will entail monitoring his blood pressure  curtailing his smoking habit  and regular check-ups to track aortic stability.  Slide 10: Closing Remarks This case underscores the importance of rapid diagnosis and intervention in aortic dissection. It also highlights how high-risk individuals like Mr. Smith can be helped with a timely response.  Slide 11: Q&A End the presentation by acknowledging questions and providing answers to the audience. 
Aortic Dissection,3,48,"Title: Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection  I. Demographics  Patient Profile: Mr. JC  a 65-year-old African-American male.  II. Past Medical History  Mr. JC has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension since the age of 35. He is also a chronic smoker for the past 30 years with a 50-pack year history. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  including his father who suffered from an aortic aneurysm. Other than this  Mr. JC does not have any known history of connective tissue disorders or genetic disorders like Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  III. Current Clinical Presentation  The patient presented to the emergency department with acute-onset  severe  """"tearing"""" chest pain radiating to his back  and a syncopal episode. Additionally  he reported difficulty breathing and a generalized weakness.   IV. Preliminary Examination and Investigations  Physical examination disclosed a blood pressure discrepancy between his arms; 155/95 mmHg on the right arm and 130/85 mmHg on the left arm  and a heart rate of 110 bpm. A grade 3/6 diastolic murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation hinting a potential aortic regurgitation. Neurological examination was largely unremarkable apart from minor confusion likely attributed to the intense pain.  An electrocardiogram showed no signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction. However  a chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum. Owing to the high clinical suspicion of aortic dissection  a CT Angiogram was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis by demonstrating an intimal flap with a true and false lumen in the ascending aorta indicative of Stanford type A aortic dissection.  In conclusion  consistent with the literature  our patient represents the typical demographic (male  aged over 60  African-American) with significant risk factors (smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  family history) predisposing him to aortic dissection. This case also underscores the importance of prompt recognition and management of aortic dissection  which can often present with non-specific symptoms  and the diagnostic value of advanced imaging methods."
Aortic Dissection,3,49,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Introduction - Patient Demographics Our patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male who presents a case of aortic dissection. He lives in a suburban environment and is a retiree from a busy corporate job. Statistical data suggest a higher prevalence of aortic dissections among men and in the age group of 60-80 years  aligning with our patient's demographic profile.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Our patient has a history of hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  having been diagnosed 15 years ago. Over these years  despite medication  his blood pressure control has been intermittent at best. Furthermore  he has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years  which is a known risk factor for vascular diseases. His father and grandfather both suffered from cardiovascular disease.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Patient initially reported sudden sharp throbbing pain in the chest  discomfort while breathing accompanied by shortness of breath. His pain was said to radiate to his back  mainly between his shoulder blades.  Slide 4: Diagnostic Results An ECG done initially showed no signs of myocardial infarction. A CT aortogram successfully confirmed the aortic dissection  showing an Intimal flap in the Ascending aorta. Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels.   Slide 5: Management & Treatment Following the diagnosis  the patient was immediately given IV beta-blockers to manage hypertension. To fix the underlying issue  the patient underwent successful life-saving emergency surgery- an aortic valve replacement and the placement of a Dacron graft.   Slide 6: Ongoing Care & Prevention  Following the operation  the patient was transitioned to a strict regime of antihypertensive drugs  coupled with regular medical check-ups. He was advised to quit smoking  make dietary changes  and engage in light physical activity like walking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Slide 7: Key Takeaway  This case underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and management of aortic dissection  particularly in patients with a known history of hypertension and smoking. It also highlights our role as healthcare providers in educating patients about the dangers of uncontrolled blood pressure and the benefits of lifestyle changes.
Aortic Dissection,3,50,Title: Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Aortic dissection is a serious condition involving a tear in the inner layer of the aorta — the large blood vessel branching off the heart. Let's explore a typical case presentation of an older adult man with past cardiovascular risks reflecting the fact that incidence of aortic dissection is higher in men and people over 60 years of age.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient: Mr. Jackson  an African-American male - Age: 68 years old - Occupation: Retired teacher - It's noteworthy that this case mirrors research findings that black men have higher rates of aortic dissection and other cardiovascular diseases as compared to their white counterparts.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms - Severe chest pain described as sharp and tearing - Pain radiating to the back  between the shoulder blades - Shortness of breath  sweating  weakness  and nausea  Slide 4: Past Medical History - Hypertension  adequately controlled by medication - History of smoking (quit 10 years ago) - Moderate alcohol consumption - Family history of heart disease - No history of trauma or injury to the chest  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests - D-dimer: Elevated  a standard test for aortic dissection. - CT angiography: Confirmed the diagnosis by showing a tear in the aorta and blood flowing into the aortic wall. - EKG: No signs of heart attack  which is important to distinguish because of similar presenting symptoms.  Slide 6: Management and Outcome - Immediate admission to ICU - Control of hypertension with intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside - Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon for potential surgical intervention - Follow-up CT scans revealed successful management of aortic dissection  with cessation of blood flow into the aortic wall.  Slide 7: Final Notes It's crucial that clinicians recognize and act rapidly on the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection due to its high fatality rate when left untreated.

Aortic Dissection,3,57,Title: Aortic Dissection in Middle-Aged African American Male  Slide 1: Introduction Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the aorta. This case study examines Mr. J  a 60-year-old African American male presenting with symptoms indicative of an acute Type B Aortic dissection. Statistically  higher prevalence of aortic dissection is found in males  and it typically manifests in later life; African Americans also have higher rates of hypertensive-related aortic dissection.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient: Mr. J - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Accountant (retired) - Residence: Urban   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. J was diagnosed with controlled hypertension 15 years ago. He has a 10-year history of cigarette smoking and quit 5 years ago. Additionally  he was diagnosed with mild obesity (BMI 32). No known family history of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)  including aortic aneurysm or dissection.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms & Clinical Findings  Mr. J visited the ER reporting sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiated to his back. The pain was described as tearing or ripping in nature. He also experienced shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and anxiety.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation An urgent Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) showed a suspected aortic dissection. This finding was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) which revealed dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the abdominal aorta - indicative of Type B Aortic Dissection.   Slide 6: Treatment Mr. J was immediately started on beta-blocker therapy to control blood pressure and heart rate. He was also put on vasodilator therapy to decrease shear stress on the aorta. As the dissection was not immediately life threatening and given Mr. J’s medical history  conservative management was opted over surgery.   Slide 7: Follow-Up & Prognosis Mr. J was discharged after a week  maintaining optimal blood pressure control. He was advised to adhere strictly to his medications  regularly monitor his blood pressure  and immediately report any changes in symptoms. He will be scheduled to undergo regular follow-ups  with imaging studies like the CT scan  to monitor the aorta size.   Slide 8: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment in patients with aortic dissection. High-risk populations such as hypertensive  middle-aged African American males should be provided with appropriate education and risk factor reduction strategies to prevent this potentially life-threatening condition.

Aortic Dissection,3,60,Title: A Case Presentation on Aortic Dissection   Slide 1: Introduction   This case presentation discusses a condition known as Aortic Dissection. Aortic Dissection is a severe condition in which the inner layer of the aorta  the large blood vessel branching off the heart  tears. Blood surges through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect).  Slide 2: Patient Information  Mr. Smith is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain. Patient is a retired teacher living in a suburban setting with his wife.   Slide 3: Medical History   Mr. Smith has a history of chronic hypertension with poor compliance to medications. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history  quit 10 years ago. Additionally  he has a history of moderate alcohol use.  Slide 4: Risk Factors  It’s crucial to note that middle-aged to older men  particularly those with a history of hypertension and smoking  are at increased risk for aortic dissection—a pattern consistent with Mr. Smith's demographics and medical history.  Slide 5: Physical Examination   On presentation  his blood pressure was 170/110 mmHg with a pulse of 100 bpm. He appears in moderate distress due to pain. Exam revealed diaphoresis  pallor  and asymmetrical pulses in his upper extremities.  Slide 6: Diagnosis   Considering his age  history of hypertension  the nature of his chest pain  and his physical examination findings  an Aortic dissection was suspected. Subsequent CT angiography confirmed a Stanford Type B aortic dissection.  Slide 7: Treatment   Mr. Smith was immediately started on rigorous antihypertensive therapy aiming to lower his blood pressure and decrease aortic wall stress. Given the type B dissection  a surgical approach was deferred  and he was managed medically.  Slide 8: Prognosis   The early diagnosis and initiation of treatment significantly improve the prognosis in aortic dissection. However  regular follow-up is critical due to the progressive nature of this disease.  Slide 9: Conclusion   This case We present serves as a classic example of an Aortic dissection—its presentation  risk factors  and the importance of an early and rapid diagnosis. It underscores the seriousness of hypertension management  especially among older  male patients.   Slide 10: References  A list of scientific articles and resources that contributed to the information included in this presentation.

Aortic Dissection,3,61,"Title: Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient  Slide 1: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a demographic at higher risk for aortic dissection. He's a retired coal miner  living with his wife  and has two adult children. Patient has a history of smoking  consuming one pack daily for 40 years  and a moderate alcohol consumption   Slide 2: Medical and Family History   The patient has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension. He has been non-compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive medication  which has resulted in persistent high blood pressure. Additionally  he has familial history of cardiovascular diseases  specifically a father who experienced an aortic dissection in his late 60s.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaint   The patient reported suddenly experienced severe chest pain that radiated to his back. The pain was described as """"tearing"""" and reached peak severity quickly.   Slide 4: Examination and Diagnosis  On examination  the patient had different blood pressures in his arms. A subsequent CT scan revealed a dissection of the ascending aorta.   Slide 5: Risk Factors  As per literature  the patient's demographic  smoking history  uncontrolled hypertension  and family history significantly contributed to the incidence of aortic dissection. Furthermore  age is another major risk factor  with most aortic dissections occurring in patients aged 55-70 years.  Slide 6: Management  The patient underwent an emergent cardiac surgery to repair the dissection. Post-operative care involved control of blood pressure to limit worsening of the dissection.  Slide 7: Patient Education and Prevention  As part of the patient's discharge plan  there would be emphasis on antihypertensive medication adherence  smoking cessation  and regular follow-up to monitor his condition. Family members will also be educated about the genetic predisposition of aortic dissection and prevention measures.

It emphasizes the crucial role of risk factor management and early detection in the prevention and management of this potentially fatal condition. "
Aortic Dissection,3,62,Slide 1: Introduction  Aortic dissection is a serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta  the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body  tears. Blood then surges into the middle layer of the aorta  causing it to dissect or split apart. It's often fatal if not quickly and efficiently treated.  Slide 2: Demographics  Aortic dissection is relatively rare  occurring most frequently in men aged 60-70. Approximately twice as many men are affected as women. The incidence is reported around 2.6-3.5 per 100 000 person-years. African-American males are also disproportionately affected.  Slide 3: Patient Presentation  Patient X is a 65-year-old African American male presenting with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back  with history of hypertension and smoking. A grandparent had a history of aortic aneurysm.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  This patient has a well-documented history of untreated hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. Also  a history of smoking which increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Family history includes a grandparent who had an aortic aneurysm  introducing the potential for genetic predisposition.  Slide 5: Physical Examination & Symptoms  On examination  there's notable differences in blood pressure between arms  weak pulse in one arm  and possible signs of shock such as pale skin  rapid heart rate  and low blood pressure. Patient suffers from sudden  severe chest or upper back pain  loss of consciousness  shortness of breath  and difficulty speaking.  Slide 6: Tests and Diagnosis  An aortogram confirmed diagnosis of aortic dissection. An EKG and chest X-ray were also conducted which ruled out heart attack and revealed widened mediastinum. Lab tests were conducted to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms.  Slide 7: Treatment and Management  The patient was immediately started on medications to lower blood pressure and slow the heartbeat  reducing the force of blood against the aortic wall. Surgical intervention was decided upon due to the location of the dissection (type A).  Slide 8: Follow Up and Prognosis  Regular check-ups have been scheduled to monitor blood pressure and overall cardiac health. The patient has been informed about the importance of taking prescribed medications consistently  lifestyle modifications to manage hypertension  and cessation of smoking.  Concluding Slide: Importance of Early Detection and Treatment  While aortic dissection is a rare condition  it is also frequently fatal if undetected or untreated. It is crucial to be aware of the risk factors  signs  and symptoms  and encourage patients with relevant demographics and medical history to seek immediate medical attention should they experience sudden  severe chest or back pain.

Aortic Dissection,3,69,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Presentation Slide 1:  Introduction  We present a case study about a 66-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with aortic dissection. This case intends to shed light on the clinical features  diagnosis  management  and prognosis of this medical condition.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. According to literature  aortic dissection is more prevalent in the male population  in the ratio of 3:1  and the incidence peaks in the sixth decade of life. Also  Caucasians and individuals of an older age group are at a higher risk numerically due to the larger population size  thus representing the majority of cases.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History  The patient had a history of high blood pressure  which was poorly controlled with medication  reflecting literature that identifies hypertension as the main risk factor in about 75% of all aortic dissection cases. Additionally  he had a previous history of heavy tobacco use. Although smoking is not directly related  it contributes to hypertension and arteriosclerotic vascular disease  which makes the aorta susceptible to dissection.   Slide 4: Existing Comorbidities  The patient had been previously diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder affecting the connective tissue that provides structural support to the aortic wall. People who have Marfan syndrome have a higher risk of developing aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms  Our patient had suddenly developed severe chest pain  described as a tearing sensation  radiating to his back. He mentioned dizziness  shortness of breath and fainting. From clinical records  these symptoms align with a typical presentation of aortic dissection.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Slide 7: Management & Prognosis  Slide 8: Conclusion  The complexities of our patient's case illustrate the urgency of identifying risk factors  interpreting clinical symptoms accurately  and appropriately managing cases of aortic dissection to reduce the high risk of morbidity and mortality.

Aortic Dissection,3,71,"Title: A Case of Aortic Dissection: A Comprehensive Review  1. Patient Introduction    Our patient  Mr. T  is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with chest pain radiating to the back.   2. Demographics    According to literature  aortic dissection primarily affects males  specifically  older males  with the incidence being highest among individuals aged 50-70. In addition  Caucasian males are more susceptible to the condition compared to other races. Our patient falls into the peak age and racial group for this condition.  3. Past Medical History    Mr. T has a considerable history of hypertension  running in his family. He suffers from heavy smoking and leads a sedentary lifestyle  both of which contribute to an unhealthy body mass index (BMI). Furthermore  he suffers from type 2 diabetes  but his glycaemia is well controlled with his medication.  4. Present Complaint    Mr. T complained of severe chest pain  described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  which started suddenly while he was working in his yard.  5. Diagnosis & Discussion      Based on Mr. T's history of hypertension  his age  demographics  and the symptoms presented  we have a strong suspicion of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is often associated with hypertension and smoking  especially in older Caucasian men. The sudden onset of severe chest pain  often described as a tearing or ripping sensation  is a classic presentation. Studies show that genetic predisposition also plays a part in aortic dissection cases  and with Mr. T's family history of hypertension  this further increases his risk.  6. Clinical Approach      With a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection  we immediately ordered a computed tomography angiography (CTA) which revealed an intimal tear in Mr. T's aorta  consistent with our suspect of an aortic dissection.        Our team immediately contacted the cardiothoracic surgeon and prepared Mr. T for a possible surgical intervention. The incident merits an urgent clinical response  given the lethal nature of aortic dissection if left untreated.  7. Conclusion      Mr. T's case underlines the vital role a comprehensive history and physical examination play in the quick detection and treatment of lethal conditions such as aortic dissection. The case also reinforces the significance of demographic and lifestyle factors in predicting and managing specific diseases like aortic dissection.     Please note: This case was created for educational purposes  utilizing the typical demographics and clinical presentation found in literature for aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,3,72,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Case Presentation Introduction  Today  we will be discussing a case of aortic dissection. We will detail the patient's demographic information  past medical history  and course of treatment based on the data available in medical literature and research studies.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year-old African American male. He is a retired engineer from an urban setting. Studies reveal that an incidence of aortic dissection tends to be higher in men in their 60's to 70's and the African American population experiences a higher case fatality rate than their White counterparts.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Our patient has a history of hypertension which is considered a high risk for developing aortic dissection. He also has smoked heavily for 40 years  adding an additional risk factor. He doesn't have any relevant family history. He briefly mentioned experiencing episodes of vague chest discomfort over the past few months but did not seek medical attention.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Our patient presented with severe chest pain  described as “ripping” and “tearing”  radiating to his back. He also reported feeling a sudden onset of weakness in his lower extremities. His blood pressure on presentation was found to be significantly different in each arm.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Assessment   Based on the severity of pain  findings on physical examination and history  we suspected aortic dissection. A CT scan of the chest was ordered revealing a type B aortic dissection. Echocardiography and CT angiography confirmed the dissection.  Slide 6: Course of Treatment  Given the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection  conservative management was initiated. This primarily involved blood pressure control using beta-blockers and sodium nitroprusside. Regular follow-ups were scheduled for surveillance imaging.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Our patient highlights how personal lifestyle and pre-existing conditions can contribute to aortic dissection. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for survival  underscoring the necessity of maintaining a high level of suspicion for this condition among hypertensive patients presenting with unexplained chest pain.  --- Slide 8: Questions  Now  we invite questions and discussion on the presented case. Let’s explore how we could extrapolate these insights to provide better patient care and educational initiatives in our practices.

Aortic Dissection,3,78,Title: Aortic Dissection - A Critical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Patients diagnosed with aortic dissection  a serious condition associated with high mortality rates  are predominantly males in their mid-60s. Our case presentation focuses on a 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Slide 2: Demographic Statistics The Aortic Dissection population is composed primarily of men (65-75%)  and the risk drastically increases with age  averaging around 62-70 years. Caucasians are more commonly affected.  Slide 3: Patient Background Our patient  Mr. X  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  with a past medical history of chronic hypertension and heavy tobacco use.  Slide 4: Patient History Mr. X presented with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back. His prior diagnosis of hypertension constitutes the most critical risk factor for his current condition.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination and Presentation Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure (180/100)  a faint pulse in the left arm  and a murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. The patient exhibited distress and anxiety due to his severe pain.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Findings CT angiography confirmed a diagnosis of aortic dissection  Type B  originating just past the aortic arch and extending into the descending thoracic aorta.  Slide 7: Historical Risk Factors Correlation Chronic hypertension has likely contributed to the degeneration of the patient's aortic media  facilitating the dissection. Moreover  toxins from long-term tobacco consumption could have further damaged his aortic walls.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Early diagnosis and appropriate management are critical for patients suffering from aortic dissections  like Mr. X. His upcoming treatment plan may entail aggressive blood pressure management  pain control  and potentially surgical intervention.  Slide 9: Lessons Learned Mr. X's case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients above 60 years of age presenting with severe chest pain  especially when there is a past medical history of chronic hypertension and tobacco use.

Aortic Dissection,3,80,Title: A Clore Case Study on Aortic Dissection   Slide 1:  Title: Demographics Point 1: Patient is a 65-year-old African American male Point 2: Retired construction worker Point 3: Residing in urban Ohio  Rationale: African American patients are found to be less commonly presenting with aortic dissection but exhibit higher mortality rates. The choice of age is consistent with literature indicating aortic dissection is more common in males around 60-70 years of age. The profession indicates potential physical stress and health hazards  potentially contributing to the disorder's occurrence.  Slide 2:  Title: Past Medical History Point 1: History of untreated hypertension Point 2: Past smoker - 25 pack years Point 3: Family history of cardiovascular diseases  Rationale: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  with about 75% of patients with aortic dissection having a prior history of hypertension. Likewise  smoking is known to damage the cardiovascular system  and a significant family history points to a genetic susceptibility to developing cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 3:  Title: Symptoms Presentation Point 1: Intense  stabbing pain in the chest and back Point 2: Shortness of breath Point 3: Weakness and sweating  Rationale: Aortic dissections often present as unexpected  sharp  tearing pain. Shortness of breath may indicate complications involving the aortic valve or structures near the aorta.   Slide 4:  Title: Diagnostic Tests  Point 1: CT scan reveals aortic dissection in the descending aorta Point 2: Blood tests reveal elevated D-dimer levels Point 3: EKG revealed no signs of myocardial infarction  Rationale: CT scan is the most common imaging test for aortic dissection  which along with a high D-dimer level confirm the diagnosis. EKG helps rule out differential diagnosis  specifically a heart attack.  Slide 5:  Title: Management Plan Point 1: Medical management of blood pressure with beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers Point 2: Regular follow-up imaging to monitor aortic size Point 3: Lifestyle modification advice including quitting smoking and maintaining healthy blood pressure.  Rationale: In the case of descending aortic dissections  conservative management is often recommended  which includes maintaining a low blood pressure (< 120 mm Hg systolic if possible) and follow up imaging to monitor any progression. Lifestyle modifications add to the long-term management plan particularly in relation to quitting smoking and hypertension management.

Aortic Dissection,3,82,"Title: A Case Study of Aortic Dissection  1. Introduction We present the case of a 65-year-old black male known with hypertension  who reported to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain described as """"tearing"""" in nature.  2. Demographics Aortic dissections are more common in men  the ratio is approximately 2-3:1. According to literature  black men are at a higher risk compared to their white counterparts. Majority of the patients are between 60-80 years old with a median age of 63. Our patient falls in this age group thus representative of the demographic distribution in the literature.  3. Past Medical History The patient has a 10-years long history of hypertension and reveals non-compliance with antihypertensive medication due to side-effect concerns. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for aortic dissection  observed in about 75% of cases.  4. Presenting Complaint The patient reported severe chest pain with a sudden onset  which he described as sharp  tearing  and radiating to the back. Such pain is typical in over 90% of patients with aortic disfunctions.  5. Further Evaluations On examination  a difference in blood pressure between both arms was noted  a classic sign pointing towards an aortic dissection. The ECG showed no signs of acute myocardial infarction.  6. Investigations CTA confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A aortic dissection  extending from the ascending aorta to the superior mesenteric artery.  7. Management The patient was started on intravenous beta-blockers to control blood pressure and heart rate  and he underwent emergent surgical repair to replace the dissected part of the aorta with a synthetic graft.  8. Conclusion While being a relatively rare pathology  aortic dissection carries high morbidity and mortality rates if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Patient's demographic data  history of hypertension  and classic clinical presentation  are all key components to suspicion and diagnostic confirmation.  9. Discussion Understanding the typical demographic and clinical presentation of such cases primes us well for quicker identification and management  thereby increasing survival rates and reducing complications.

Aortic Dissection,3,85,Title: A Clinical Presentation on Aortic Discretion: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction  Topic: Aortic Dissection   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Here  we present a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male  John Doe  presenting with aortic dissection. This demographic (older Caucasian males) represents a significant proportion of aortic dissection cases. However  aortic dissection affects both sexes  all races  and all age groups.  Slide 3: Patient’s Previous Medical History  John Doe was diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension ten years ago. His reluctance towards consistent medication usage and poor lifestyle behaviors contribute to his hypertension. He also has a history of tobacco use  which has compounded his risk of developing aortic dissection. Both hypertension and smoking are well documented as being significant risk factors for aortic dissection.  Slide 4: Symptoms and Presentation  John presents with sudden severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain is described as tearing in nature. John also exhibits symptoms of nausea  vomiting  and profuse sweating.   Slide 5: Physical Exam and Diagnosis Upon examination  John had differing blood pressure readings in his arms. A subsequent CT angiography confirmed the suspicion of aortic dissection  defining it as type B as it originated distal to the left subclavian artery.  Slide 6: Overview of Aortic Dissection  Aortic Dissection is a serious condition characterized by a tear in the aorta's inner layer. This leads to the formation of two pathways for blood flow  thus weakening the aorta's structure and increasing the risk of rupture.  Slide 7: Treatment and Prevention Treatment options are rooted in mitigating high blood pressure  the primary risk factor. Beta-blockers are preferred  although other antihypertensives may be used. John should also cease smoking. In severe cases like John’s where the risk of rupture is high  surgical intervention may be necessary.  Slide 8: Conclusion Effective management of John’s aortic dissection primarily focuses on controlling his hypertension and encouraging lifestyle modifications to reduce future risk. This case illustrates the importance of educating patients on the adverse risks of uncontrolled hypertension and the profound effect lifestyle changes can have in mitigating those risks.  Slide 9: References A prospective review of relevant literature on aortic dissection  demographics  and risk factors.
Aortic Dissection,3,86,"Title: A Case of Aortic Dissection in an Adult Male  Slide 1: Introduction Aortic dissection is a potentially lethal illness and quickly manifests as a medical emergency. The following real-world case presentation reportedly involved a 55-year-old African-American male with risk factors that align with the demographic most commonly afflicted with this condition in the literature.  Slide 2: Patient Background & Past Medical History The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male  with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. He's also a long-time smoker  with a 30-pack year smoking history. These conditions  notably hypertension and smoking  make this demographic specifically vulnerable to aortic dissection.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints & Symptoms The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain that began unexpectedly. It radiates to his back and is described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping."""" The pain has persisted for 3 hours since onset. The patient also reported nausea  light-headedness  and shortness of breath.  Slide 4: Physical Examination & Investigations  On physical examination  the patient was uncomfortable  with sweat beads on his forehead. His blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg with a split difference between the left and right arm. He had a weakened pulse in the lower extremities in comparison to the upper. This heightened the suspicion of aortic dissection. Upon conducting a CT scan  it revealed a Type B aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Course of Treatment The patient was initially managed for pain and hypertension. He was started on IV beta-blockers to control blood pressure and heart rate. As it was a type B (it did not involve the ascending aorta)  a conservative treatment approach was favored initially. Ongoing monitoring and repeated imaging have been advised to detect early signs of potential complications.  Slide 6: Conclusions & Learning Points This case underscores the importance of noting risk factors in relation to demographic data. It emphasizes the need for prompt recognition and immediate diagnostic testing for swift management of aortic dissection. Early detection dramatically improves outcomes  underlining the need for high clinical suspicion in similar patients.   Merely relying on population and demographic data can lead to delayed diagnosis and poorer outcomes in high-risk individuals  as aortic dissection is a medical emergency. Therefore  it is crucial to heighten the awareness of its risk factors and typical presentations among healthcare professionals."

Aortic Dissection,3,100,Slide 1: Introduction  Aortic dissection is a serious and life-threatening medical condition that occurs when the inner layer of the aorta tears. Due to the significant mortality associated with this condition  an understanding and prompt diagnosis is vital for timely treatment.  Slide 2: Demographics  Aortic dissection typically affects men aged between 60 and 70  however it can occur at any age. Statistically  the condition is more prevalent among males  accounting for 65% of cases. Persons of African descent are approximately 2 to 3 times more likely to experience aortic dissection compared to caucasians.  Slide 3: Case Presentation  Our patient  Mr. R  is a 67-year-old African American male smoker with a known history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He presents to the ER with sudden severe chest pain  radiating to his back described as 'tearing' in nature.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Mr. R has been suffering from hypertension for the past 15 years and has been irregular with his medication. He also has hyperlipidemia and has been a smoker for around 40 years. He previously underwent a coronary angioplasty. There is no family history of aortic disease.  Slide 5: Clinical Assessment  Physical examination revealed an anxious patient with elevated blood pressure mainly in the right arm. Cardiovascular exam demonstrated irregular heart sounds  discrepancy in peripheral pulses and a murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation.   Slide 6: Investigations  The EKG does not show any evidence of myocardial infarction and lab tests are within normal limits except for a mild elevation in D-dimer. The defining diagnostic test is the CT angiography of the chest  which demonstrates dissection of the ascending aorta.  Slide 7: Management  Mr. R was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive medication to control his blood pressure and heart rate. An emergency cardiothoracic surgical consult was sought for a possible surgical repair of the dissection.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of understanding the demographics and risk factors associated with aortic dissection. The need for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management can be life-saving in such situations. Encouraging healthy lifestyle choices may significantly decrease the risk for developing this condition.

He has no history of cardiac disease or surgeries. No familial history of connective tissue disorders. The sudden onset of severe chest-to-back pain in a hypertensive smoker is suspicious for aortic dissection  necessitating immediate investigation and potential intervention."
Aortic Dissection,5,11,A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia and smoking  presents to the ER with acute severe chest pain radiating to his back. The onset of pain was sudden and has been persistently worsening over the past few hours. The patient also reports feelings of faintness  and shortness of breath. His medical history includes a 10-year history of poorly controlled hypertension  a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  a 20-year history of hyperlipidemia  and a history of chronic heavy smoking. His prescriptions include amlodipine  metformin and atorvastatin. The patient is also a retired mechanic  living with his spouse and has a family history of cardiovascular disease – his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. Physical examination reveals significant hypertension with a blood pressure reading of 190/110 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 110 beats/min. His mental status is slightly altered due to pain and anxiety. The physical exam also reveals weak femoral pulses and an early diastolic murmur on cardiovascular examination. The patient's EKG is unremarkable.
Aortic Dissection,5,12,"A 60-year-old African-American male former smoker with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  Marfan syndrome  and familial history of aortic diseases presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain that radiates to his back.

On examination  the patient has unequal blood pressure readings in both arms and an early diastolic murmur on auscultation  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. His EKG shows no evidence of myocardial infarction.   According to available evidence  this patient's risk factors  such as advanced age  male gender  African-American race  history of smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and genetic predisposition (Marfan syndrome  family history)  align with common risk factors associated with aortic dissection. His presenting symptoms are highly suggestive of the condition."
Aortic Dissection,5,13,A 67-year-old African-American male with a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain started while he was at rest and has steadily worsened over the past several hours. The patient also reports feeling weak and lightheaded but denies any other symptoms such as shortness of breath  nausea  or diaphoresis. Examination reveals a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg in the right arm and 145/90 mmHg in the left arm. Heart rate is regular but elevated at 100 bpm. Cardiovascular exam documents an early diastolic murmur but is otherwise unremarkable. Neurological evaluation reveals a stable and alert patient without focal deficits. Given the patient's age  race  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and the acute onset of severe  tearing chest plus back pain  he is suspected to have an aortic dissection warranting urgent imaging and vascular surgical consultation.
Aortic Dissection,5,14,A 65-year-old African American male with a known history of chronic uncontrolled hypertension and tobacco use presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. He also reports feeling lightheaded and short of breath. An initial physical examination reveals asymmetrical blood pressure readings in his arms  a high-pitched diastolic murmur best heard over the right second intercostal space  and weak or absent pulses in his lower extremities. His medical history is significant for a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome during his adolescence. He experiences no relief with nitroglycerin administration. The patient's ongoing tobacco use  hypertension  along with his Marfan syndrome  predispose him to cardiovascular issues  and his symptoms are suggestive of aortic dissection.

Aortic dissection is highly suspected given the patient's advanced age  male gender  African American ethnicity  and history of prolonged hypertension and extensive smoking. The presentation of severe chest pain of sudden onset that is tearing or ripping in character  radiating to the back  along with physical findings of a diastolic murmur and discrepancy in pulses is consistent with this diagnosis. His symptom of cold  numb legs potentially indicates compromised blood flow to the lower extremities  suggesting a type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta. This condition constitutes a medical emergency  and a surgical consult is warranted for potential repair.

Aortic Dissection,6,2,Problem Representation:  Patient Characteristics: - Age 60s to 70s - Gender: Majority Male - Ethnicity: African-American - Occupation: Retired - Socio-Economic status: Middle-class - Sedentary Lifestyle  Medical and Family History: - Hypertension: Existing condition  well-controlled with medication but with occasional high readings noted. - Atherosclerosis: Mild to moderate degree of plaque buildup in arteries. - Family history: Father died from aortic dissection at age 70. - Smoking history: Significant  smoked half a pack daily for 40 years  quit 10 years ago. - Alcohol history: Regular alcohol use  1-2 standard drinks daily. - No previous surgeries - No known allergies  Presenting Symptoms: - Severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping  starting in the chest and radiating towards the back. - Possible loss of consciousness. - Shortness of breath and difficulty in speaking due to pain. - Varying degrees of pain and symptoms based on the type and severity of the dissection.  Physical Examination: - Elevated blood pressure  particularly in upper extremities. - Positive for pulsus paradoxus. - Possible presence of a diastolic murmur  indicative of aortic regurgitation. - Findings can vary based on the type and location of the dissection.  Possible Imaging and Lab Tests: - CT scan with contrast: To visualize the dissection and determine its extent. - Transesophageal echocardiography: To confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications. - D-dimer test: May be elevated  normal results can help to exclude dissection. - Complete Blood Count (CBC)  Electrolytes  Troponin  BUN/creatinine: To assess for other complications or concurrent problems.  This patient fits the typical demographic and medical history of a patient presenting with aortic dissection as supported by current literature. Aortic dissection is more common in males  particularly of African-American descent  and in those aged 60-70. Hypertension  atherosclerosis  smoking  and alcohol use have all been identified as risk factors. The presentation  notably the severe tearing pain radiating to the back  is highly suggestive of the condition. Confirmatory imaging and further management would be based on the patient's overall medical condition and stability.
Aortic Dissection,6,3,Problem Representation:   Subject:  Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old African American male with a past medical history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and high cholesterol. His family history is significant with a dad who died of a heart attack at 65 and a brother diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of sharp  severe chest pain radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. The pain started an hour ago while he was resting at home and was unlike any he had ever experienced.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a fifteen-year history of hypertension which was poorly controlled despite being on medication. He also has a high cholesterol level for which he takes a statin. However  he admits not always taking it regularly due to occasional side effects. He is also a former smoker who quit 5 years ago after a 30-year history of smoking.  Family and Social History:  His father died at the age of 65 due to a myocardial infarction and his elder brother  age 64  recently underwent a surgical procedure for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He consumes alcohol occasionally and admits to a 5-year history of recreational cocaine use in his younger years but denies any recent drug use.  Current Medications:  Atenolol 50mg qDay  Lipitor 40mg qDay  This clinical scenario is representative of a high-risk demographic group (older  hypertensive male  African American  smoker  high cholesterol  family history of aortic disease) for aortic dissection. Regarding the racial bias  even though ethnicity is not identified as an independent risk factor  some studies have shown African American ethnicity had higher rates of aortic dissection  potentially due to higher prevalence of hypertension in this population. His history of poorly controlled hypertension and high cholesterol  family history  and his previous smoking and cocaine use  are all important contributing factors that increase this patient's risk of developing aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,6,4,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old African-American male presents to the emergency department. He is an ex-smoker with a 35-pack-year history  quit smoking 10 years ago. He takes medication for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed well for the past 15 years. He also has a history of elevated cholesterol levels requiring statin therapy. The patient is retired and lives alone.  Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is described as tearing and came on suddenly. It began while he was cleaning his home. He describes feeling nauseous and anxious.  Family History: There is a relevant family history of cardiovascular diseases  including his father who had a myocardial infarction at age 60  and his maternal grandfather who died from a stroke.   Social History: He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He is relatively active  often going for walks and doing exercises at home.  Evaluation: Upon examination  blood pressure is found to be markedly different between his right and left arms. There are no significant murmurs and lung sounds are clear.  a) Problem: Suspected aortic dissection b) Context: A high-risk male patient with an appropriate clinical history and relevant symptoms c) Indicators: History of smoking  hypertension  type II diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia; sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back  noticeable difference in blood pressure between two arms. d) Actions: The patient is immediately referred for a CT angiography of his chest and further cardiovascular evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the aortic dissection. e) Follow-up/Outcome: Pending results of the imaging  the patient will likely be admitted to the hospital for monitoring and treatment  which may include surgery if the dissection involves the ascending aorta or if his condition worsens. f) Notes: An aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate diagnosis and management. Patient profiles like this one  with multiple risk factors  necessitate a high index of suspicion when they present with the appropriate symptoms.
Aortic Dissection,6,5,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient we are considering is a 67-year-old African American male  as the incidence of aortic dissection is reportedly higher in males with an average age of onset around 60-70 years. It is also observed to be a bit more prevalent among Black or African American people compared to other races.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented in the emergency department (ED) exhibiting severe sharp  tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. The pain was acute in onset. He also reports symptoms of light-headedness and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: This patient has a history of untreated high blood pressure (hypertension)  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. He also had a prior history of smoking  which has been linked to cardiovascular diseases. There's a family history of connective tissue disorders  particularly Marfan syndrome in this case  which increases the risk for aortic diseases. Finally  the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) about 7 years ago  another factor that could contribute to the current condition.  Current Medications: The patient is currently not under any antihypertensive medication  resulting in his hypertension being uncontrolled. There are no other medications recorded  and it's noted that the patient has been non-compliant with prescriptions in the past.  Physical Examination: On physical exam  the patient appeared in severe distress. Blood pressure readings in both arms showed significant difference  a possible indicator of aortic dissection. Heart rate was slightly accelerated  and there were audible diastolic murmurs noted over the aortic area.  Based on the age  gender  race  severe tearing chest pain  and blood pressure differential  the patient's symptoms point towards a possible aortic dissection  that needs to be confirmed with appropriate imaging techniques  including echocardiography or computed tomography angiogram (CTA).

In terms of family history  his father had a history of coronary artery disease and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70. Mr. Johnson himself has a history of heavy alcohol use  but he quit fifteen years ago. He has been working as a mechanic  known for its high-stress environment  and does not engage in regular physical exercise. He has missed several primary care appointments in the past and does not adhere to a healthy diet.  He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication  which has led to poorly controlled blood pressure over several years. He is also notorious for avoiding healthcare visits due to the fear of diagnoses and interventions. His CBC  lipid panel  and kidney function tests have been abnormal in the past. He had a bout of acute kidney injury three years ago which has led to chronic kidney disease. His previous EKG reports have shown left ventricular hypertrophy.  Based on the literature  Mr. Johnson falls into the highest risk demographic for aortic dissection given his age  race  male gender  hypertension  smoking and alcohol history  obesity  and peripheral artery disease. His presentation is also consistent with classic symptoms of aortic dissection  which include severe chest pain  radiated pain and symptoms related to organ ischemia. Non-compliant behavior with his antihypertensive drugs may have also contributed to his condition.   In conclusion  Mr. Johnson is a high-risk patient for aortic dissection and requires urgent diagnostic and potentially surgical intervention.
Aortic Dissection,6,7,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient is a heavy smoker having 50 pack-year tobacco smoking history. The patient also reports previous history of hypertension for which he has been on medication.   Past Medical History: The patient's medical history involves high blood pressure which he has been dealing with for the past 15 years. He has been prescribed medication but the control has been inconsistent. Records show the patient has been incompliant with his hypertensive medication. He also has a history of smoking excessively for decades. No other significant issues like heart disease  diabetes or other chronic illnesses are found in the patient’s past medical records.   Family History:  The patient's father and uncle had a history of heart disease and hypertension.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with sudden  severe chest pain that has started a few hours prior to consultation. The pain tends to fluctuate  but it does not subside completely. The nature of the pain is tearing  sharp  ripping  and it radiates to his back and neck. The patient reports feeling faint and dizzy.   Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals Pulse deficit and blood pressure difference between the left and right arm which rises a suspicion of aortic dissection. The pulse  blood pressure  and other preliminary physical examination results are significantly abnormal.  Considering the manifestation of symptoms  the medical history of the patient  the presentation of severe tearing chest and back pain  pulse differential  and hypertension  suspicion for aortic dissection gets higher and demands immediate attention and further investigation.  Relevant Demographic Data: From the literature  we found that aortic dissection is more common in men than women  with about 65% of cases being male. It most often occurs in people aged 65 and older and is more common in Caucasian men. Risk factors associated with aortic dissection include hypertension  smoking  and a history of heart disease. With these considerations  our patient representation aligns with accurate demographic​ representation.
Aortic Dissection,6,8,"Patient Representation:  Profile:  The patient is a 69-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension presenting with sudden and severe chest pain.  Demographics: The patient lives in an urban environment and has a history of smoking for 40 years  recently quit last year. He is retired and lives with his wife  who is his caregiver. He has a record of occasional alcohol consumption. The patient is obese with a BMI of 30.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents with sudden  severe chest pain  which he describes as """"tearing"""". The pain seemed to radiate towards the back. Additionally  the patient seems a bit anxious and is sweating profusely.   Past Medical History:  Significant for hypertension  which has been somewhat poorly controlled. He has had episodic increases in systolic blood pressure  noted to be as high as 180 mm Hg. The patient also has a history of high cholesterol  for which he takes medications.   Family History: His father died at the age of 76 from myocardial infarction. His mother died at the age of 82 from a stroke. The patient has one younger brother who is living with type 2 diabetes.  Relevant Test Results: His chest X-ray shows a widened mediastinum. His aortic diameter measured via Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is >5cm  indicative of aneurysmal dilation. Recent blood pressure readings show systolic pressure consistently above 140 mm Hg  despite medical management.  In conclusion  this is a high-risk patient due to age  ethnicity  uncontrolled hypertension  history of tobacco use  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of acute onset  severe chest pain combined with radiographic findings suggests possible aortic dissection. Further diagnostic testing is necessary to confirm.   (Note: The demographics here are broadly representative and based on general literature suggesting that older  hypertensive males  especially of African American ethnicity  and smokers are at higher risk for aortic dissection. But the probability of these conditions may vary with individual risk factors and geographic location.)"
Aortic Dissection,6,9,Problem Representation:  Patient: A 65-year-old African American male  History: The patient has a previous medical history of high blood pressure which has been poorly controlled for the past 10 years. He was diagnosed with hypertension in his mid-50s and was prescribed antihypertensive medication  which he admits to not taking consistently. He also has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. The patient doesn't have any history of cardiac surgery. His father died from a stroke at the age of 70  and he has a younger brother with coronary artery disease.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  described as sharp and tearing  radiating to the back. The pain started about an hour ago and has been progressive.   Vital Signs: Blood pressure is found to be significantly different between both arms  with the right arm being 145/95 mmHg and the left arm being 120/80mmHg. Pulse rate is elevated at 110 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation is 95% in room air.   Physical Examination: The patient is anxious and diaphoretic. There is decreased breath sound in left lower lung fields and a grade II/VI diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.  The aforementioned patient representation is typical for aortic dissection  reflecting demographic information from literature that suggests higher prevalence among males and African Americans. It includes relevant risk factors like hypertension  smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient's presentation  physical exam findings  and vitals are suggestive of aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition  warranting immediate diagnostic investigation and management.
Aortic Dissection,6,10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Name: John Doe - Age: 69 - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired veteran - Insurance: Medicare - Marital Status: Married  Presenting Problem: John presents with sudden  severe pain in the chest and the back  typical of aortic dissection. The pain started while he was having dinner with his wife. He reports dizziness  shortness of breath  fainting and weak pulse in one arm.  Past Medical History: - Smoker for 40 years (quitted 5 years ago) - Diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  irregular blood pressure control - Had a heart attack 10 years ago - Diagnosed with high cholesterol 15 years ago - History of peripheral vascular disease - No reported allergies  Family History:  - Father died due to heart attack at the age of 70 - Mother has hypertension  currently alive and in her late 90's - No siblings - Two sons  both alive and well  Social History: - Retired veteran  use to provide moderate physical activity as a part of daily routine  which has been drastically reduced post retirement. - Alcohol: Occasional  light drinker - Tobacco: Quit smoking 5 years ago after a 40-year smoking history  Current Medication: - Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension - Aspirin 81mg daily due to past heart attack - Atorvastatin 40mg daily for high cholesterol  It should be noted that the most common risk factors for aortic dissection are hypertension and a history of smoking  both of which John has. This along with his presenting symptoms give a high index of suspicion for an aortic dissection. His other factors such as age  gender  history of heart diseases and race also align with demographic representation in literature for aortic dissection patients.   Reference: Rajagopalan  S.

Aortic Dissection,6,11,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - A 70-year-old African-American male.  Demographic and Lifestyle Characteristics: - The patient is a retired truck driver  living with his wife. - He is overweight with a BMI of 30.  - His lifestyle includes a diet high in fats and salts  sedentary with minimal physical activity.  - He has been a lifelong smoker with around 40 pack years of smoking history. - He admits to chronic alcohol consumption.  Relevant Past Medical History: - The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years. - About 5 years back  he suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) but recovered with no residual damage. - He also had a Marfan syndrome evaluation that came back inconclusive  which requires further follow-up. - He has often complained of chest pain over the last year which was attributed to costochondritis. - Five months ago  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and is not well controlled.  Current Problems: - The patient presents with a sudden and severe tearing chest pain  radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. - His blood pressure on presentation is elevated at 200/120 mmHg. - He appears pale  sweaty  and in intense pain. - Pulsus paradoxus is noted on physical examination and heart murmur is detected.  Possible Disease Associations: The given symptoms  clinical presentation  and medical history suggest a possible diagnosis of aortic dissection. His uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  and diabetic condition contribute significantly towards this suspicion as they are known risk factors. His age  gender  and ethnicity also line up with the demographic factors typically associated with increased risk of aortic dissection.  Next Steps: Further diagnostic tests such as a CT scan or angiography will be required to confirm the suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection. Immediate medical attention to control the elevated blood pressure and manage the pain is necessary. A thorough cardiovascular examination and consultation with a cardiologist is needed for this patient.  Based on literary studies  aortic dissection is more prevalent in males  often above 60 years old. Hypertension is the most common risk factor. Other risk factors include tobacco use  high-intensity weightlifting  pregnancy and conditions such as Marfan syndrome  bicuspid aortic valve or a history of heart surgery. Ethnicity is also considered as a predisposing factor  with African-Americans having a higher prevalence. It is thus critical to take these into consideration when assessing a patient for a potential aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,12,Problem Representation:   Subject: Mr. Doe  a 62-year-old African American male  presented with sharp  severe chest pain radiating to the back  accompanied by shortness of breath and faintness. His medical history includes uncontrolled hypertension for the last 15 years  smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years  and a family history of vascular diseases. He does not regularly take his antihypertensive medications.  On physical examination  he presented with varied blood pressure readings on both arms  a rapid heartbeat  and slight paralysis of the lower extremities. He appears anxious and diaphoretic. There is no history of trauma or injury. He works as an administrative officer  is married with two children  and lives in an urban area.  Background: Studies have shown that the peak age for aortic dissection is the sixth and seventh decades of life  with a mean age of 63 years. Men account for approximately two-thirds of cases and are twice as likely to suffer from it than women. African Americans have a higher predisposition towards this condition  and hypertension is considered a key risk factor  present in more than 75% of cases. Other risk factors include smoking  hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)  atherosclerosis  and family history of vascular diseases.  Risk stratification: Given the patient's presentation and past medical history  Mr. Doe has several risk factors making him at a high risk for aortic dissection: age  male gender  African American ethnicity  hypertension  smoking history  and family history of vascular diseases. Immediate diagnostic procedures and appropriate medical intervention are required.  Plan: Immediate CT angiography is necessary to confirm aortic dissection diagnosis. Given the acute presentation  hypertension  and high suspicion of aortic dissection  the patient should be admitted to the hospital intensive care unit for close monitoring and quick intervention if the condition deteriorates. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated immediately  aiming to control blood pressure. If the diagnosis is confirmed  surgical consultation will be necessary.    Follow up and recommendation: he should quit smoking and he should be followed up closely by a cardiologist  a vascular surgeon  and primary care physician who can address his hypertension control and overall cardiovascular risk.   Note: This problem representation is a general indication. Each patient should be individually evaluated and managed based on their conditions and characteristics.
Aortic Dissection,6,13,Problem Representation:  I. Demographics:  The patient is a 61-year-old African-American male who currently works as a truck driver. His body mass index (BMI) is 28  indicating that he is overweight. He is a current smoker  consuming 1 pack of cigarettes per day over the last 25 years. He is not a heavy alcohol drinker and does not take any drugs. He lives alone and has no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His dietary habits involve fast food and high-sodium snacks due to his demanding work schedule.  II. Clinical Presentation and History:  The patient presents with sudden severe chest pain that is described as tearing in nature and radiates to his back. He has associated symptoms of profuse sweating  faintness  and shortness of breath. There is no history of fever  cough  hemoptysis  or other respiratory symptoms. He denies any symptoms of right upper quadrant pain  jaundice  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  III. Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension  which was diagnosed three years ago. He has been irregular with his blood pressure medications and tends to forget to take them due to his irregular work schedule. He shows no history of diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. Records indicate that he has not been screened for aneurysms or other related diseases due to his lack of consistent healthcare follow-up.  In terms of surgeries  he had a right inguinal hernia repair approximately 5 years ago but no other major surgeries or hospitalizations. He has no known drug allergies but is known to skip his daily antihypertensive medication (Metoprolol) due to occasional side effects involving mild dizziness.  His latest blood pressure measurement indicates high blood pressure (165/95 mmHg). His last Lipid profile check was 18 months ago  and it showed normal values. For routine diabetes screening  the patient declined further examination. His resting electrocardiogram  done a year ago  was normal.  IV. Social History  The patient lives alone and works as a long-haul truck driver. He currently smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and has an irregular dietary and sleep schedule due to his work. He does not exercise regularly. The patient acknowledges poor control over his blood pressure  due to often forgetting to take his medicine because of his busy and unpredictable work schedule.   This patient  being African American and male  falls into a demographic that carries a higher risk of aortic dissection. His age  hypertension  and smoking habits further compound his risk. His symptoms of severe and sudden chest pain that radiates to his back carry high suspicion for aortic dissection  particularly given his personal and demographic predispositions.
Aortic Dissection,6,14,Patient Profile:  Demographics: - Gender: Male - Age: 65 years - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired schoolteacher - Socioeconomic status: Lower-middle-class - Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  on medication (ACE inhibitors)  sometimes noncompliant with medication. - Smoking: Smoked 1 pack a day for 30 years  quit 5 years ago. - Elevated cholesterol: Managed with diet and statin medication. - No history of diabetes.  Presenting Complaint: - Sudden severe pain in the chest  described as tearing or ripping  radiating to the back.  Representation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired schoolteacher from an urban setting presents with sudden severe chest pain described as tearing or ripping  radiating to the back. The patient has a significant history of hypertension diagnosed a decade ago and has been prescribed ACE inhibitors  although compliance to medication is intermittent. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but quit around 5 years ago. Elevated cholesterol levels have been managed with dietary changes and the help of statin medication. The patient has no past medical history of diabetes.  There is a higher incidence of aortic dissection in males  particularly of Caucasian ethnicity. The primary risk factor is hypertension  which our patient has suffered from for the past decade. The patient's long history of smoking has likely contributed to a weakened aortic wall. Elevated cholesterol levels could have aided in plaque formation  further stressing the aortic wall. It's also important to note the patient's age; aortic dissection is more common in those over 60.
Aortic Dissection,6,15,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 69-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of systemic hypertension  a 40-year history of smoking and a confirmed diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents to the Emergency Department with severe  sudden onset chest pain that he describes as 'tearing' in nature. The pain is located in his anterior chest and radiates to his back. The patient additionally expresses feelings of anxiety and reports symptoms like inclining dyspnea and palpitations.  Onset: The pain began around 2 hours ago while he was at rest  watching television. His symptoms have continued to intensify since onset.  Associated factors: His blood pressure reading revealed an abnormally high measurement. Additionally  the patient has diaphoresis and appears to be in distress.   Past Medical History: Diagnosis 1 - Systemic hypertension Diagnosis 2 - Marfan syndrome  The patient has been on anti-hypertensive medication for the past ten years  however  he admits to not managing his blood pressure adequately and states that his medication adherence has been poor. His history of smoking has made him more susceptible to developing a variety of cardiovascular health conditions.  Relevant Family History: The patient's family has a documented history of aortic disease  with his father dying suddenly at the age of 57 from an aortic dissection.  Physical Examination Findings: On examination  he has asymmetrical blood pressure readings in his arms with diminished peripheral pulses. Additionally  cardiac examination reveals a diastolic murmur  consistent with aortic insufficiency.   Clinical Reasoning: The patient's age  gender  aforementioned symptomatology  and the mentioned risk factors (hypertension  smoking  history of Marfan syndrome  and family history of aortic disease) incline suspicion towards an aortic dissection. The 'tearing' chest pain radiating to the back  his high blood pressure readings  and the presence of a diastolic murmur further support this hypothesis. Thus  the patient should be efficiently assessed using appropriate diagnostic tools like Computed Tomography (CT) scan for definite diagnosis and further management.
Aortic Dissection,6,16,Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint: “A sudden  intense chest pain in mid-chest”  Patient Profile: A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents with sudden  intense chest pain localized to the mid-chest  which started an hour ago. The pain is tearing in nature and has since then radiated to the back. The patient also reports shortness of breath  sweating  and dizziness.   Personal History: The patient is a smoker with a 40 pack-year history and drinks alcohol socially. He admits to not exercising regularly and could be considered overweight or obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29. His diet is generally high in fat and low in fibre.  Family History: There is a history of cardiovascular diseases in his family. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 58 and his older brother had a stroke two years ago.   Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hypertension that has been poorly controlled for the last decade. He also suffers from hypercholesterolemia for last 5 years and takes statins irregularly. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which is controlled with oral anti-diabetic agents.   Past Surgical History: The patient went undergone an appendectomy in his twenties with no complications.  Medications: The patient is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes. He is supposed to be on Atorvastatin for his high cholesterol  but admits that he doesn't take it regularly.  Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.  Presumptive Diagnosis:  Based on the above information  the patient's symptoms and risk factors align with an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,17,Problem Representation:  Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male. He is a retired mechanic and a current smoker with a pack-per-day habit for the past 40 years. He drinks alcohol occasionally and reports a diet high in red meat but low in fruits and vegetables.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient was brought to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain began about an hour prior to admission while the patient was in his garage working on a car.   Past Medical History:  He has a confirmed history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled for the past 15 years. In addition  the patient was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago but has been non-compliant with his lipid-lowering medication. He also has peripheral artery disease diagnosed three years ago  for which he refuses to change his lifestyle.    Family History: The patient's father died of a myocardial infarction in his 70s  and his mother passed away from a stroke in her late 60s. His older brother had an aortic dissection at the age of 62.   Physical Examination: On examination  he appears to be in severe distress with diaphoresis. Blood pressure measurements show a significant difference between his right and left arms. Auscultation reveals a murmur consistent with aortic insufficiency.   This representation is in line with findings in medical literature  which state that older-aged  male  African American individuals with a history of smoking and uncontrolled hypertension are at a significantly higher risk for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,18,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 69-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  presents to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset chest pain that has been ongoing for the past two hours. He described the pain as a sharp  """"tearing"""" sensation radiating to his back. On a scale from 1-10  he rates the intensity of the pain as 9. He appears pale  anxious  and diaphoretic. He is a long-term smoker with a 50-pack-year history.   Background: Mr. X has a known history of hypertension  which his primary care physician has struggled to control despite medication compliance and lifestyle modifications. He also has a relevant family history of aortic dissection  with his father having suffered from the disease at a similar age. Furthermore  he has a history of high cholesterol and minor coronary artery disease  for which he takes aspirin and statins.  Personal habits: He is a retired school teacher with a sedentary lifestyle. His diet is high in fat and cholesterol  and he consumes moderate alcohol. He does not engage in regular physical activity owing to his demanding job and has been under considerable stress recently.  In this case  the problem space is the aortic dissection  and the demographic representation focuses on the increased risk associated with male sex  older age  and white race. The relevant past medical history (e.g.  familial predisposition  hypertension  high cholesterol  coronary artery disease  smoking) helps to illuminate potential contributing risk factors that must be considered.   Relevant literature: Literature suggests that the majority of patients with aortic dissection are male (75%)  and the mean age at presentation is 63 years (Clouse et al.  2004). However  the incidence significantly increases after age 60. White individuals  particularly men  are of higher risk (Howard et al.  2013). Smoking and hypertension are considered among the top risk factors  contributing to more than 70% of all cases. Family history cannot be ignored as it is prevalent in about a fifth of cases (Nienaber & Clough  2015). Furthermore  pre-existing cardiovascular diseases also increase the risk of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,6,19,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset  severe chest pain that has been radiating to his back. He describes the pain as tearing and says it is unlike anything he has experienced before. He also reports feeling lightheaded and has vomited once at home.  Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known history of high blood pressure (hypertension) for the past 10 years  which is poorly controlled with medication. He also has a history of moderate tobacco use  smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. There is also a known history of cardiovascular disease  with a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. He denies illicit drug use but reports having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his long history of smoking. He has no known drug allergies. His father died of a stroke in his early 70s  and his mother had breast cancer.  Demographic Information: Mr. Johnson is retired from his job as a truck driver. He lives with his wife and they have two grown children who live out of state. He completed high school but did not attend college. He has been on Medicare since he retired. He claims to have average diet habits  yet confesses he rarely exercises.   Literature Perspective: Literature indicates that demographic characteristics such as being of African-American ethnicity  being a male  and being over the age of 60 pose an increased risk for aortic dissection (AD). Additionally  AD is typically associated with a history of hypertension  tobacco use  and pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. These risk factors  coupled with his presenting symptoms  make aortic dissection a primary diagnostic concern for Mr. Johnson.
Aortic Dissection,6,20,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer - Lifestyle: Moderate alcohol consumption; Non-smoker; Regular physical exercises  - Current location: Urban  Past Medical History:  - High blood pressure: Has been treating hypertension for the last 15 years. - High cholesterol level: On low-dose statin therapy for last 10 years. - Heart disease: Diagnosed with atherosclerosis 5 years ago. - Previous surgeries: Underwent angioplasty procedure 3 years ago. - Diabetes: No history of diabetes. - Family history: Father died of a heart attack at age 72; mother is alive and well at 85 (has hypertension). - Medications: Regularly takes antihypertensive medication and statins - Allergies: Has mild allergy to penicillin  eliciting mild rash.  Present Complaints:  - Acute Chest Pain: Patient came to the emergency room complaining of severe chest pain that started suddenly. The pain described as tearing  is located in the chest  and radiates to the back. - Shortness of breath: Patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing  especially when climbing stairs. - Syncope: Patient had a syncopal episode at home just before coming to the hospital.  Exposure history:  - Infection: No recent history of infection. - Travel: No recent travel history.  Pre-existing Conditions:  - High-risk factors: Long-standing hypertension  high cholesterol level  advanced age  male  family history of heart disease. - Lifestyle factors: Moderate alcohol consumption  Regular exercise.  Physical Examination (performed at the time of presentation):  - Vital signs: blood pressure was high (170/100 mmHg)  heart rate was elevated (105 beats/minute)  the oxygen saturation measured at 95% on room air. - General Appearance: Appears pale and sweaty  Test Results (lab results to be included after assessment):  - Relevant diagnostic tests to consider: Echocardiogram  CT angiography  cardiac enzymes  EKG.    Triggers:  - Hypertension: Our patient has a long history of hypertension  which increases the risk of aortic dissection. - Atherosclerosis: His history of atherosclerosis may also have contributed to his current presentation.    Goals:  - Immediate stabilization of the patient: Managing high blood pressure to prevent further dissection. - Accurate diagnosis: Use of imaging studies to confirm diagnosis. - Safe and effective treatment: Depending on the type and location of the aortic dissection  the patient may require immediate surgery or could be managed medically under close observation initially.
Aortic Dissection,6,21,"Demographic Characterization:  Patient's Identity: 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. The patient has a well-documented history of hypertension. 2. He also has a history of tobacco use (30 pack-years history  quit 10 years ago). 3. Diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome at an early age. 4. He has undergone a procedure for a bicuspid aortic valve a few years ago. 5. He has a familial history of aortic dissection (his father and elder brother had the same issue).  Initial Presentation:  The patient  Mr. XYZ  presents himself to the emergency department of Main Street Hospital with severe chest pain described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping """" which began suddenly about an hour ago. The pain radiates towards the back and seems to move downwards. He is visibly in distress and appears pale and sweaty.  Other Relevant Information:  The patient has been managing his hypertension quite well with prescribed medication (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors)  under regular follow-up with his primary care physician. He also takes the prescribed medication for Marfan's syndrome  which includes beta-blockers. He does not have any allergies to medicines as far as his clinical records suggest. He does not drink alcohol and quit smoking a decade ago.  Note: This is a common representation of an aortic dissection case  although the actual presentation may vary among different individuals. Hypertension is known to be the most common predisposing factor for aortic dissection  and this scenario also discusses an inherited connective tissue disorder (Marfan's syndrome) which is seen in about 5% of patients. Smoking is another risk factor that increases the likelihood of aortic dissection. It is also important to note that men are two to three times more likely to experience aortic dissection than women. In about 20% of cases  aortic dissection can be familial. The age group of 60-70 years old represents a significant number of patients with aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,6,22,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male. The patient lives in an urban setting with his wife and is a retired school teacher. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago. He claims to drink alcohol sparingly  primarily on social occasions.   Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension for about 25 years managed with amlodipine. He was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 15 years ago managed with metformin. The patient also has a history of hypercholesterolemia managed with simvastatin. There are no known allergies to medications.   Representation of the Primary Problem: The patient reports chest pain that began suddenly about 12 hours ago. It was described as a sharp  severe pain that radiated to his back. It was accompanied by profuse sweating  nausea  and vomiting. He also experienced shortness of breath. There is no prior history of similar pain.   Evidence Of Need: The sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back  in combination with his past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  points towards a possible aortic dissection. Aortic dissections predominantly occur in older males  fortifying the patient falls into the risk category. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for aortic dissection  which is prevalent in this patient's chart. Immediate investigation and management may be necessary to prevent serious complications such as rupture of the aorta which could lead to a life-threatening situation.  Rationale Statement: Given the patient's demographics  past medical history  and presentation  it is crucial to evaluate him for aortic dissection. African American males over the age of 65 have a higher prevalence of hypertension and are at an increased risk of aortic dissection. His history of hypertension  as well as his age  race  and gender  put him in high risk category  justifying further diagnostic studies  such as CT angiography of the aorta. Concurrently  this case must be managed as a medical emergency  to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.
Aortic Dissection,6,23,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  retired from his job. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has a moderate drinking habit. He leads a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity. His diet is not balanced and tends to be high in fats and cholesterol.  Chief Complaint: He presents to the ER with a severe tearing or ripping pain in the chest which started about 2 hours ago. The pain seems to radiate to his back.  Past Medical History: He has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  for which he has been non-compliant with his medications. He was diagnosed with moderately enlarged aorta (4.5 cm) two years ago during a routine check-up. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels. His family history includes one brother with an aortic aneurysm and one sister deceased from aortic dissection.  Demographic Characterization: According to published literature  a typical patient with aortic dissection is adult  often male  mostly between the ages of 60-70. African-Americans are shown to have a higher rate of aortic dissections. It is mainly seen in individuals with a history of hypertension and other cardiac diseases  smoking  high cholesterol  and family history of aortic aneurysms/dissections. The onset is often marked by severe chest pain radiating to the back.   In summary  this patient’s profile of being a 65-year-old  African-American  male smoker with uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol  enlarged aorta  and a family history of aortic disorders fit well into the demographic characteristics often seen in patients with aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,6,24,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male who presents with a sudden onset of severe chest and abdominal pain  radiating to the back. The pain is described as a tearing sensation. He also reports shortness of breath and feeling faint. He has high blood pressure  obesity  and a history of smoking 30-pack years. Additionally  he has a documented history of high cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease. He has a known family history of aortic dissection.  Problem Representation:  Patient is a late-middle-aged black male  with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  positive smoking history  who presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute aortic dissection  acute  severe  tearing chest  and back pain along with shortness of breath. He comes from a family with a history of aortic dissection.  This representation captures the key features of an individual likely to experience an aortic dissection based on demographic information and past medical history. According to the literature  men are more likely to experience aortic dissection  and the incidence increases with age  particularly after the age of 60 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441906/]. African Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension  a key risk factor for aortic dissection [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12891055/]. Other risk factors include smoking  hyperlipidemia  obesity  and a family history of aortic dissection. The patient's presentation with sudden and severe tearing chest and back pain is classic for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,25,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 63-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension and tobacco use. He presents with a sudden onset severe chest pain  described as tearing  radiating to his back. The patient also reported that the pain started while he was at rest and has no known triggers.  Demographics: The patient lives alone in a metropolitan city on the east coast of the United States. He is a retired construction worker who spent over 40 years in this high-physical demand industry. He has a high school education  has Medicare insurance  and receives social security benefits. He has a history of non-compliance to medications and irregular follow-ups.   Past Medical History: The patient has a 20-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  despite being prescribed antihypertensive medications multiple times. Record also states that the patient has been a chronic smoker for the past 45 years and quit only a year ago. He had been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 10 years back but has been managing it with diet and lifestyle changes since then. There's also a past surgical history of hernia repair 5 years ago. The patient does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 70  and his mother had a heart attack at the age of 75. He has one brother who is 60 years old and has type 2 diabetes.  Meds: Lisinopril 20mg daily  Aspirin 81mg daily.  Allergies:  No known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient was in obvious distress  sweating profusely with visible strain on his face. His vital signs were as follows: BP 200/120 mmHg in right arm and 180/115 mmHg in the left arm  pulse 110 bpm  temperature 98.6°F  and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. He had a significant blood pressure difference between both arms. Auscultation of the chest noted decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung. Neurologic examination showed no deficits.  Laboratory and Imaging: Lab results showed elevated D-dimer levels. A CT angiogram was ordered to diagnose the aortic dissection.  Social History: He is currently not working and lives alone. He quit smoking a year ago after a 45-year history. He denies illicit drug use or alcohol consumption.  This patient falls under the typical demographic for patients who present with aortic dissection- older age  male sex  African American ethnicity  with the presence of risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension and history of smoking.
Aortic Dissection,6,26,Problem Representation:  Patient Information:  67-year-old African American male from an urban area  Chief Complaint:  Intense and sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back  Past Medical History:  The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension. He also has a history of smoking with 30 pack-years and a moderate consumption of alcohol. The family history reveals that his father had an aortic aneurysm.  Medical Examination:  Preliminary assessment reveals a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg in the right arm and 150/90 mmHg in the left arm. He has an increased heart rate of 110 bpm. The rest of the vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination shows a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border but no other significant findings. His ECG reveals left ventricular hypertrophy indicative of the systemic hypertension  but no signs of ischemia or infarction. Pain resistant to nitroglycerin.  Relevant Labs: D-Dimer test results are highly elevated.  Imaging:  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest reveals an aortic dissection beginning after the ascending aorta  indicative of a Stanford type B aortic dissection.   Assessment: An aortic dissection is suspected given the sudden onset severe chest or back pain  differential blood pressure in both arms  and highly elevated D-Dimer level combined with confirmatory imaging studies. The patient's demographic information and past medical history  especially of hypertension and smoking  are consistent with risk factors for aortic dissection.

The patient's age  gender  notable hypertension  and chest symptoms combine to raise the suspicion of aortic dissection  warranting further diagnostic investigation.
Aortic Dissection,6,28,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 63 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer  Presenting Issue: Acute chest pain radiating to the back  Past Medical History: 1. History of hypertension for 10 years  with control not always consistent 2. History of smoking - 20 cigarettes a day for over 30 years 3. Hyperlipidemia diagnosed 5 years ago 4. Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 7 years ago 5. No previous history of cardiac disease  Family History: 1. Father died of a myocardial infarction at 66 2. Mother has history of hypertension and stroke at 71  Physical Examination Findings:  Blood Pressure: 180/100 mmHg Heart Rate: 110 beats per minute Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute Temperature: 36.8 degrees Celsius  Inconsistent peripheral pulses  Immediate Case Impression: Based on medical history and initial physical examination  the clinical suspicion is towards aortic dissection.  Representative Notes:  Mr. John Doe represents a demographic which is commonly reported in the literature for patients with aortic dissection - older age  male  with a significant history of hypertension  and a life-long heavy smoker. His history of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia further increases his cardiovascular risk. The acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back is a classical symptom often seen in patients with this condition. His inconsistent peripheral pulses and elevated blood pressure reveal hemodynamic instability often associated with aortic dissection. According to literature  this demographic and these symptoms would require immediate invasive imaging to confirm the diagnosis and dictate further management.
Aortic Dissection,6,29,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile (Demographic Characterization):  The patient is a 68-year-old African American man  who is a retired teacher  current status is non-smoker  has no history of alcohol abuse but has a poor diet resulting in obesity. He lives in an urban area  has moderate socioeconomic status  is highly educated  and is married.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago which is under moderate control with medication. History of high cholesterol found five years ago which is also managed by treatment. There was an episode five years ago where the patient experienced a minor stroke but he has shown satisfactory recovery from it. The patient does not have a family history of an aortic dissection but there is a family history of coronary artery disease. There is no record of any surgical procedures or traumas previously.   Recent Events:  The patient's current issues began two weeks ago when he started to experience mild chest pain which was initially inaccurately interpreted as acid reflux. The chest pain has gradually increased in severity  becoming more of a tearing or ripping sensation located in the center of his chest. The pain radiates to his back area and is not associated with shortness of breath  palpitation  and exertion but does get aggravated with physical activities like lifting heavy items.   In literature  it is found that an increase in age  male gender  ethnicity particularly African American race increases the risk of aortic dissection. Lifestyle factors like smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol  obesity  and a family history of heart disease can significantly contribute to the development of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,30,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension.  Demographic Information: Gender: Male Age: 63 years old Race: African American Socioeconomic status: Middle income  Occupation: Retired teacher Living situation: Lives alone  with occasional assistance from a housekeeper  Medical History: - Diagnosed with hypertension for the past 10 years  on medication. - Previously smoked for about 35 years  quit 5 years ago. - No known allergies. - Does not take any over-the-counter medications. - Father had a history of aortic dissection at age 70. - No history of diabetes  kidney disease or other chronic illness.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Johnson arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain started a few hours ago. He explains it as a ripping or tearing sensation  unlike any he has experienced before. He also reports feeling dizzy  short of breath  and presenting profuse sweating.   Vitals upon Arrival: Blood Pressure: 156/95 mmHg Heart Rate: 110 beats per minute Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute Oxygen Saturation: 92% on room air Temperature: 98.6 F (37.0 C)  Given his symptoms and history  the suspicion of an aortic dissection is high and appropriate diagnostic tests like chest X-ray and CT angiogram are ordered immediately.
Aortic Dissection,6,31,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male patient  named Mr. James Rogers  with a presenting complaint of sudden and severe chest pain  more towards the back  that began a few hours ago. The pain is described as sharp and tearing in nature. He presents with diaphoresis  feeling of impending doom  and has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. There is no significant family history of aortic diseases.  Demographics: 1. Age: 60 years 2. Sex: Male 3. Race: Caucasian. 4. Occupation: Retired Officer  Past Medical and Family History: 1. Hypertension for the past 12 years  constantly over 140/90 mmHg  albeit inconsistent with medication intake. 2. Hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 10 years ago. 3. No history of aortic aneurysm nor family history of any aortic diseases. 4. Smokes one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years. 5. Drinks alcohol socially.  Clinical Information: 1. Currently presents with intense chest pain that radiates to the back  sudden onset a few hours ago. 2. Shortness of breath 3. Diaphoresis (profuse sweating) 4. Has a weak pulse in one arm compared to the other.  This representation is based on literature findings that indicate the typical patient with aortic dissection is often a male in their 60s or 70s who suffers from untreated or poorly controlled hypertension. Smoking is a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  and hyperlipidemia is also associated with the condition. The patient's presentation of sudden  severe chest or back pain  often described as tearing or ripping  along with diaphoresis  difference in pulses and a sense of dread is characteristic of aortic dissection symptoms.
Aortic Dissection,6,32,Demographics:  - Gender: Male - Age: 62 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for 10 years  poorly controlled - Family history of cardiovascular disease - History of tobacco use  - No history of diabetes - Moderate alcohol consumption - High Cholesterol - Sedentary lifestyle  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reports experiencing severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  onset was sudden and reports feeling a pop in his chest. He also notes shortness of breath. He has never experienced any similar pain in the past.   (Background: Aortic dissection is relatively uncommon and it is most frequently seen in men in their 60s and 70s  with hypertension being a major risk factor. The patient's past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension  history of tobacco use  and family history of cardiovascular diseases make him a typical patient for aortic dissection. An atypical feature in this representation is his ethnicity  as aortic dissection is more common in African American men  but the condition is certainly not exclusive to this racial group.)
Aortic Dissection,6,33,Patient Profile:  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer Place of Residence: Louisville  Kentucky  Demographic Information:  According to literature  aortic dissections are most common in men aged 60-70 years old  Black individuals appear to have a higher risk compared to other races  although the disease affects all races. Given the patient's age and gender  he falls right within the high-risk demographic.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of essential hypertension which has been managed with medications. He also has a five-year history of cigarette smoking but quit about ten years ago. Previous medical records indicate mildly elevated cholesterol levels. He had an MI about five years ago  treated with a coronary bypass surgery. His father suffered from an aortic aneurysm in his late 60s  suggesting possible familial predisposition.  Last Checkup:  The patient's last checkup was around six months ago. At that point  his blood pressure was reported as slightly elevated  despite medication. The cholesterol level was in the borderline high risk. There was no pathological cardiac sound noticed.  Presentation:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain  radiating to the back. He described it as a 'tearing' pain. His blood pressure is irregular  with higher readings in one arm compared to another  suggesting aortic disruption. Physical examination reveals mild lower extremity weakness and a faint murmur heard over his chest.  Problem Statement:  Given the patient's age  gender  history of hypertension  history of an MI  family history  and clinical presentation  the patient could potentially be experiencing an aortic dissection. Further diagnostic steps should be taken to confirm a diagnosis - these typically involve imaging studies and lab tests.   Given the patient's presentation and risk factors  it is critical to manage this situation as an emergency due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with aortic dissection if not treated promptly. The treatment strategy should include blood pressure control  pain management  and potentially surgical intervention  depending on the extent of dissection. Regular follow-ups  along with stricter control of hypertension and cholesterol  would be crucial for the patient in the long term.
Aortic Dissection,6,34,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Mr. X is a 67-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure. He presents with severe chest pain radiating to his back  the pain had a sudden onset and began while he was at rest. He reports experiencing light-headedness and shortness of breath. The pain did not subside with rest or nitroglycerin.  Past Medical History (PMH):   Mr. X's medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension  which has been poorly controlled due to medication non-adherence. He has a history of tobacco usage of 30 pack years but quit 5 years ago. His father passed away due to an unknown cardiac disease in his mid-50s.   Demographics:  As per the literature  the typical profile for aortic dissection patients is males in their 60s to 70s  of African American ethnicity  with a history of hypertension and tobacco use. Other risk factors include atherosclerosis  bicuspid aortic valve  coarctation of the aorta  and previous cardiac surgery  as well as family history of aortic disease.  Risk factors present in Mr. X include age  sex  ethnicity  hypertension  tobacco use history  and possible family history of heart disease. His adherence to anti-hypertensive medication is an area to be addressed for controlling the evolution and preventing further complications of this condition.   In conclusion  the above information suggests that Mr. X is at a higher risk of aortic dissection. His current symptoms  along with his medical history and demographic profile support this diagnosis. His uncontrolled hypertension in particular  both as a stand-alone factor and in conjunction with his other demographic  lifestyle  and genetic risk factors  underscores the severity of the situation.
Aortic Dissection,6,35,Patient Profile: - Age: 67 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Job: Retired - Nationality: American  Health History: - Hypertension (duration: 12 years  poorly controlled by medications) - History of smoking (quit for the past 5 years) - Family medical history: Elder brother died of aortic dissection at age 72 - Past surgical history: Underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to coronary artery disease  8 years ago. - No known allergies  Problem: - Presenting symptoms: Sudden severe chest pain described as a tearing or ripping sensation  radiating to the back. - Patient complains of sweating  nausea  and shortness of breath. - On examination: elevated blood pressure; heart rate: 92 bpm; patient appears in distress. - Preliminary EKG shows nonspecific changes  no signs of myocardial infarction - Additional Findings: D-dimer test is markedly elevated.  This scenario represents a typical presentation of aortic dissection  more common in older males especially those with a history of hypertension  smoking  and heart surgeries. The demographic information and past medical history could correlate with the common known risk factors for developing aortic dissection. The symptoms and initial investigations fit within the typical clinical presentation of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,36,Patient Profile:  Problem Representation: Mr. Adams is a 63-year-old man who has just been brought to the Emergency Department (ED) suffering from severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Demographic Characteristics:  - Age: 63 - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired software engineer - Marital status: Married - Residence: Lives in a suburban area  - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle  non-smoker  mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption  Medical History:  - Hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago) - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago) - 2 episodes of Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) with no residual neurological damage (two years and six months ago) - Family history: Father died due to a stroke at the age of 72  Mother has a history of hypertension  Current Medications:  - Metformin for T2DM - Lisinopril for hypertension  Physical Examination upon arrival at ED:  - Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg  - Heart rate: 110 bpm (tachycardic)  - Respiration rate: 20 breaths/min (normal)  - Temperature: 37.2 degrees Celsius (normal)  - Oxygen saturation: 96% on room air - General discomfort  sweating  and anxiety noted  ED Notes:  - Severe pain described as 'ripping or tearing' starting abruptly in the anterior chest and radiating to the back  - The pain is constant  not related to exertion or rest  and not relieved by nitroglycerin - No symptoms of myocardial infarction (no nausea  shortness of breath  or radiation of pain to the arms) - On auscultation  faint diastolic murmur heard - EKG shows no signs of ST elevation or Q waves - Chest X-Ray ordered showing widened mediastinum - Based on clinical presentation and Chest X-Ray findings  aortic dissection suspected - CT Angiography ordered for confirmation  This problem representation has been constructed based on the fact that majority of patients with aortic dissection are male (about 65%)  aged between 60 and 70 years  often hypertensive (72–80% of cases)  and sometimes diabetic. Chronic hypertension is considered the most important risk factor. Further  the classic presentation of intense chest or abdominal pain with a ripping or tearing quality is also incorporated. This profile  therefore  portrays a prototypical patient who might present with aortic dissection.   References: 1. Evangelista A  Isselbacher EM  Bossone E  et al.

Aortic Dissection,6,37,Problem Representation:  **Demographic Characterization:**  - Age: 60-70 years (most common among people over 60) - Gender: Male (about two-thirds of all cases seen in men) - Ethnicity/Race: More seen among African Americans - Lifestyle: Smoker  regularly consumes alcohol  physically inactive  **Past Medical History:**  - Hypertension: History of high blood pressure  most commonly seen risk factor - Hypercholesterolemia: High cholesterol levels - Heart diseases: Patient has a past history of known heart diseases like valvular heart disease or ischemic heart disease - Family history: A close family member  such as a parent or sibling  has had aortic dissection - Arterial diseases: History of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) - Genetic disorders: Has a known genetic disorder which predisposes to aneurysm formation such as Marfan syndrome/ Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. - Aneurysms: Has a history of aneurysm in the aorta or other large blood vessels  **Presenting Complaints:**  - Chest pain: Sudden severe sharp chest pain  often described as tearing or ripping  radiating to the back - Shortness of breath - Dizziness or sudden fainting - Rapid/irregular pulse - Syncope - Nausea and vomiting - Signs of shock  This representation is based on a typical  high-risk patient but may vary depending on individual health histories and lifestyles  and should be adjusted based on each patient's unique characteristics.   It should also be considered that not all people who experience aortic dissection will fit into this characterization. This problem representation is mainly useful for highlighting common risk factors and symptoms to assist in early detection and intervention. It is not exhaustive  and a detailed patient history and clinical evaluation should be done.   Sources:   1. UpToDate 2. American Heart Association 3. Mayo Clinic.
Aortic Dissection,6,38,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   A 68-year-old African American male presents with sudden  severe chest pain. He describes the pain as """"ripping"""" and """"tearing""""  which started around an hour ago. The pain is located in the upper middle part of his chest and seems to radiate to his back  specifically in the area between his shoulder blades. He also admits to feeling dizzy  short of breath  and mentions a loss of consciousness.   He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and atherosclerosis  for which he is currently taking prescribed antihypertensives and statins. He also mentions a past habit of smoking regularly  which he quit around 5 years ago  and sporadic  moderate alcohol consumption. Genetic history reveals that his father died of a stroke at the age of 72  and his mother had hypertension and diabetes.  He lives alone in an urban area  is widowed  and has three children. He is a retired war veteran and mostly maintains a sedentary lifestyle.  Relevant Statistics:  Demographically speaking  the case fits in with the statistics in at least two ways. First  there is a slightly higher incidence of aortic dissection in males. Second  African Americans have a disproportionately higher incidence of hypertension compared to other racial or ethnic groups  epidemiological studies suggest that black people in the U.S. have a higher risk for aortic dissection.  Furthermore  advanced age is a risk factor  with most aortic dissections occurring in people aged 60–80. Co-existing conditions like hypertension certainly increase the risk of aortic dissection. Additionally  the patient's past history of smoking and atherosclerosis also places him at a higher risk due to potential damage to the aortic wall. His sedentary lifestyle could also have contributed to his overall cardiovascular risk profile. His familial history of stroke and hypertension suggests some genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease.  In conclusion  the patient is a typical representation of a patient presenting with an aortic dissection  given his demographic profile  past medical history  and presenting symptoms."
Aortic Dissection,6,39,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 70 Years Old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residential Area: Urban  Presenting Complaint:  Severe chest pain radiating to the back  shortness of breath and fainting spells.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension (treated with Losartan) - Type II Diabetes (controlled with Metformin) - Smoker (40 pack-years) - High cholesterol (treated with atorvastatin) - Had myocardial infarction 5 years ago  Family History: - Father died from aortic dissection at the age of 72. - Mother has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  Social History: - Smokes 1 pack of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 glasses of wine daily. - Physical activity level is minimal since retirement. - Maintains a typical Western diet.  Allergies: - No known drug allergies.  Problem Representation: 70-year-old Caucasian male  past smoking history with chronic hypertension  type II diabetes  and high cholesterol. A history of myocardial infarction  and a family history significant for aortic dissection is presenting with severe chest and back pain  shortness of breath and fainting spells. This patient's history  especially given his father's early death from aortic dissection and his personal history of long-standing hypertension and smoking  put him at high risk for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old  Caucasian male  heavy smoker for 40 years  presenting to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint: Sudden and severe chest pain that radiates to his back.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for 25 years  dyslipidemia  and obesity. He also has a surgical history of hernia repair 10 years ago.  Family History: His father died at age 70 due to stroke and his mother had an aortic aneurysm. He has one older sister who also has hypertension.  Social History: The patient admits to drinking alcohol occasionally. He lives alone after his wife passed away 2 years ago. He is currently retired  previously worked in construction.  Review of Systems: Negative except for sudden severe chest and back pain. He also reports feeling nauseated and short of breath.  Physical Examination: The patient is in obvious distress due to pain. Vital signs show elevated blood pressure (180/100 mm Hg)  pulse 110 bpm  respirations 24/min  temperature 98.6F (37C)  and SpO2 95% on room air. Cardiovascular exam reveals a harsh systolic murmur. Pulmonary exam shows clear and equal lung sounds. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Extremities exhibit no swelling or cyanosis.  Problem representation: This is a 65-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  obesity  family history of aortic aneurysm  presenting with sudden  severe chest and back pain  suggestive of an aortic dissection.   Justification: Aortic dissection has a higher prevalence in males over 60 years of age with histories of smoking and hypertension. The demographic and clinical features of the patient  including the sudden and severe pain  elevated blood pressure  and the presence of a systolic murmur  further increase suspicion for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,41,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired - Residence: Urban Area  Presenting Complaint: - Severe and sudden chest pain radiating to back - Shortness of breath  Demographic Characterization: Aortic dissection incidence is higher in males than in females and often occurs in those over 60 years old. The condition is also more prevalent in the African American community.   Relevant Past Medical History: - Hypertension: The patient has been suffering from hypertension for the past 10 years and has been inconsistently managing it with medication. - Atherosclerosis: Diagnosed with atherosclerosis five years ago.  - Smoking: Heavy smoker for the past 30 years. - Occasional Alcohol: The patient has a history of light to moderate alcohol use. - Marfan Syndrome: Although Marfan syndrome is a rare condition  the presence of it can elevate the risk of aortic dissection. In this case  the patient does not have this condition. - Family History: Father had an aortic aneurysm.  Note: Most patients with aortic dissection have a history of high blood pressure. Other potential contributing conditions include smoking and atherosclerosis. Male sex  older age  and African American ethnicity are also known risk factors. Therefore  this typical case of a patient with these specific demographic characteristic and medical history reflects accurately the profile of those most at risk of suffering an aortic dissection.   This patient's occupation and residence are included but may not directly influence the likelihood of this medical event  though a stressful job could potentially contribute to hypertension  and certain living conditions (like a high-stress urban environment) might too. Inconsistently managing his hypertension with medication increases the risk further. His family history of aortic aneurysm additionally puts him at a higher risk. He does not have Marfan syndrome  which  although a less common risk factor is a highly significant one due to the associated weakening of the connective tissues.
Aortic Dissection,6,42,Patient Profile:  - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Lifestyle: Moderate smoker  occasional alcohol use - Family History: Hypertension in mother  Presenting Problem:   Mr. X has presented with sudden extreme pain in the chest and upper back  which he describes as tearing or ripping  radiating to the arms and legs. He also reports shortness of breath and fainting episodes. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and is a moderate smoker.  Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension for the past 10 years  poorly controlled on medication (Lisinopril 10mg/day). 2. A history of smoking 1 pack/day for the last 40 years. 3. No history of heart disease or stroke. 4. No history of diabetes or high cholesterol. 5. Family history of hypertension. 6. No known drug allergies.  From a population perspective  men are more likely to suffer from aortic dissection  and there is a higher incidence rate in individuals over 60 years old. A significant portion of patients who suffer from aortic dissection are found to have a history of hypertension  and smoking is a widely acknowledged risk factor. Therefore  this profile is representative of a typical patient with aortic dissection.   The information provided includes all relevant medical and lifestyle factors that would contribute to aortic dissection risk. A history of uncontrolled hypertension and a prolonged smoking career are the most notable aspects in this context. Additionally  this information will help provide a comprehensive image of the patient's health status when formulating a plan for addressing the current medical crisis and future prevention strategies.   While patients without any known risk factors can still experience aortic dissections  individuals with profiles similar to Mr. X's represent more typical cases and have a higher overall risk.

In this case  it is important to consider that Mr. Pathak is at high risk of aortic dissection given his age  male sex  hypertension  and other cardiovascular risk factors like hypercholesterolemia  smoking history and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. This is aligned with the studies which indicates that men  in their sixties or seventies  are more prone to aortic dissection  and up to three-quarters have a history of hypertension. Smoking is meanwhile recognized as a risk factor for aortic diseases  including dissection. Lastly  about a third of individuals with aortic dissection have a family history of the disease.
Aortic Dissection,6,44,Problem Representation:  Name: Mr. Smith Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Location: Urban area  Presenting Complaint: Sudden onset severe ripping or tearing chest pain that radiates to the back  shortness of breath  and feeling faint.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure for the last 20 years and is on medication. 2. High cholesterol: The patient is also known to have elevated levels of cholesterol for which he takes medication. 3. History of tobacco use: Mr. Smith was a heavy smoker for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. 4. Prior cardiac surgery: The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 5 years ago.  Family History: A history of aortic dissection in a first-degree relative.  This paradigmatic case is based on the epidemiological data present in the literature that suggest aortic dissections are more common in men than in women  with a peak incidence in the 6th and 7th decade of life. It often presents as a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension over a long duration and is frequently associated with smoking  hyperlipidemia  prior cardiac surgery  and is more common in caucasians. Furthermore  a familiar trend pointing to a genetic predisposition has been identified.  Risk Factors: The risk factors include hypertension  raised cholesterol levels  smoking  prior heart surgery  and family history.  Objective findings on physical examination:  1. Pulse deficit 2. Aortic regurgitation 3. Hypertension in the right arm compared to the left 4. Neurological signs related to ischemia in the territories supplied by the carotid or vertebral arteries.  The investigation included an immediate CT Scan which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Urgent management has been planned with the cardiothoracic team.  The patient has been counselled about the condition  the urgent need for surgical intervention  and the risks associated with it.
Aortic Dissection,6,45,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 60-years-old  Sex: Male  Race: African-American  Occupation: Retired military sergeant  Living Situation: Lives alone  with occasional home visits from a healthcare aide  Behavioral Characteristics: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumption  Medical History:  - Chronic Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  currently managed with medication (Lisinopril) - Hyperlipidemia: Controlled with statin therapy (Atorvastatin) - Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diagnosed five years ago  managed with Metformin - History of tobacco use (quit 15 years ago) - Has not been adherent to regular exercise due to recurring episodes of chest pain and breathlessness  - Atrial Fibrillation: Diagnosed 2 years ago  taking apixaban  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Smith presents to the emergency department with severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  along with shortness of breath and fainting episodes. Previous episodes of chest pain were not severe  sudden  or accompanied by the other symptoms.  This hypothetical case is based on literature which suggests that men  particularly those of African American descent  aged between 60-70 years  with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and tobacco use are at an increased risk for aortic dissection. Due to Mr. Smith's presenting symptoms  including severe and sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting spells  aortic dissection is suspected. His history of chronic conditions  particularly hypertension and diabetes  would further increase this risk.
Aortic Dissection,6,46,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Sex: Male Age: 56 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Office worker  Medical History: Hypertension - Diagnosed 8 years ago  currently under medication (Lisinopril) Previous Myocardial Infarction - 3 years ago Smoking history - 30 pack years  quit smoking 2 years ago High cholesterol - Diagnosed 5 years ago  currently under medication (Atorvastatin) Family history - Father had fatal aortic dissection at the age of 60.   Presenting Problem: John presented to the emergency department with sudden and severe chest pain  that was tearing or ripping and radiated to his back. He also reported feeling short of breath. On examination  his blood pressure was found to be asymmetric between two arms and a new  yet mild  aortic regurgitation murmur was heard.   Based on demographic data  John fits into the high-risk group for aortic dissection because he's a middle aged  Caucasian male with hypertension and a family history of aortic dissection. Additionally  known risk factors for aortic dissection such as a history of high blood pressure  high cholesterol  previous heart attack  and smoking - all of which John has had in his medical history - were also present.   In terms of the presenting problem  the sudden severe chest pain described as a ripping/tearing pain associated with shortness of breath  asymmetric blood pressure  and aortic regurgitation murmur aligns with the typical clinical presentations of aortic dissection  suggesting the need for rapid diagnostic imaging and further management.
Aortic Dissection,6,47,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Patient is a 65-year-old male who is of African American ethnicity. The patient is a retired schoolteacher  living with his wife in an urban setting.  Presenting Problem: The patient has been experiencing sudden severe chest pain that radiates to the back for the past 3 hours. The nature of the pain is described as a tearing or ripping sensation. He also describes feeling short of breath and has nearly fainted couple of times.  Past Medical History: This patient has a medical history of: 1. Hypertension – diagnosed 15 years ago and poorly controlled on current medication regimen 2. High cholesterol levels – diagnosed 10 years ago 3. Smoking habit – 30 pack years 4. Family history of aortic diseases  Other relevant information: Patient has been compliant with his medications for hypertension and high cholesterol but has failed multiple attempts to quit smoking. His last reported BP recording was 170/100mm Hg  taken a week ago in a routine follow up visit. His father died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 55.  This case representation corresponds to the typical characteristics for aortic dissection patients as described in the literature: 60-70 years of age  male  with hypertension being a major risk factor. Smoking and high cholesterol are additional risk factors. Note that although aortic dissection is rare in general population  African Americans have higher rates of occurrence compared to Caucasians and Asians. Family history of aortic diseases also contributes to a higher risk of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,48,Patient Representation:  Mr. Green is a 62-year-old African-American male who works as an electrician. He presents with severe chest pain that's been worsening since yesterday. The pain starts from the center of his chest and radiates to his back  described as tearing or ripping. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  anxiety  nausea  fainting and sudden difficulty in speaking or understanding speech.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Green was diagnosed with hypertension eight years ago  which remains poorly controlled. He has also been a smoker for the past 40 years with an average of 20 cigarettes per day. He has a history of high cholesterol levels  known for 10 years  for which he takes atorvastatin. He reports no history of diabetes or kidney disease. Mr. Green infrequently drinks alcohol and denies any recreational drug use. There is a family history of hypertension and heart disease.  Explanation:  Aortic dissection is more common in males  occurring in two thirds of patients  and the peak prevalence is in the 6th and 7th decades of life. African-American males are at a higher risk factor due to the disproportionate prevalence of hypertension in this demographic group. Smoking and dyslipidemia are also predisposing factors. Hypertension is the most common risk factor  found in more than 70% of patients. Patients often have a history of cardiovascular disease  atherosclerosis  or prior cardiac surgery. Family history of aortic disease may be present in around one fifth of patients. Finally  chest pain  often described as severe  tearing or ripping  and sometimes radiating to the back  is typically the presenting symptom. Other symptoms may include those related to malperfusion syndromes  such as syncope or stroke symptoms.
Aortic Dissection,6,49,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old African-American male presents with an abrupt onset of severe chest pain. He described the pain as a tearing sensation that radiates to his back  and that it started suddenly.  Past Medical History: He has a well-documented history of poorly controlled hypertension over the past 20 years  as well as a moderate history of smoking and moderate alcohol use. He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease 5 years ago for which he underwent angioplasty. He follows up regularly with his primary care physician but is often noncompliant with his prescribed antihypertensive medications. Furthermore  he has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Findings: The patient has a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg on his right arm and 155/95 mmHg on his left arm. His pulse is 90 beats/min and irregular. His BMI is 30  indicating obesity. On examination  there is intercostal retractions and decreased breath sounds on the left side of the chest. A cardiovascular exam shows widened mediastinum on chest X-rays.  Problem: Suspected aortic dissection given the abrupt onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back  history of uncontrolled hypertension  peripheral arterial disease  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and the cardiovascular exam showing widened mediastinum.  References: Based on literature  our problem representation aligns with demographic representation  where the incidence of aortic dissection is higher in males  individuals with a history of hypertension  and in the older age group. Additionally  literature suggests African-Americans have a higher incidence of aortic dissection compared to Caucasians. Other common risk factors include smoking  obesity  peripheral vascular disease  and a family history of cardiovascular disease.
Aortic Dissection,6,50,Problem Representation:   Demographic Information:  A 65-year-old male who is mainly of Caucasian descent. He's a former smoker and alcoholic  with a sedentary lifestyle and a diet that tends to be high in fat and cholesterol.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presents with sudden and severe chest pain that radiates to the back  similar to the pain in a heart attack. He also reports shortness of breath  anxiety  weakness  and fainting spells. The patient categorizes his pain as sharp and tearing.  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension  which he has been managing for the past 15 years. He has a high-degree aortic stenosis. There's a family history of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection and congenital heart defects. The patient had a thoracic aortic aneurysm discovered 10 years ago  which was not surgically repaired. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and was recently diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue  which can lead to aortic dissection.   Socioeconomic Background:  The patient lives alone in an urban setting and struggles in maintaining a healthy diet due to financial constraints. He undergoes regular check-ups  but adherence to medication regimes is not consistent because of the costs associated with the treatment.  This report represents a typical patient who might present with aortic dissection. However  it's important to note that the presentation can vary significantly. Complete patient history  thorough physical examination  and necessary diagnostic procedures must be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and form an effective treatment plan. 
Aortic Dissection,6,51,Patient Representation:  Mr. X  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain which he describes as a tearing sensation that radiates to his back. He has been experiencing this sudden onset of pain for around 30 minutes. He is currently a smoker  consuming approximately one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. His medical history reveals untreated hypertension and high cholesterol levels  for which he has neglected regular medications. He has no family history of cardiovascular diseases. He lives alone. He is retired  and his former occupation was truck driving.  As for lifestyle  Mr. X is sedentary and prefers to spend most of his spare time watching television. He also confirms that he does not engage in any regular physical activity and has an unhealthy diet high in saturated fats. His alcohol consumption is moderate. He weighs 220 lbs. and is 5ft 10inches tall  indicating a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31.6  which classifies him as obese.  Previous medical records mention that he was diagnosed with early-stage chronic kidney disease two years ago and has borderline diabetes. He also has a history of sporadic episodes of chest pain  for which he rarely sought medical attention.   Summarizing  Mr. X is a typical patient who has significant risk factors such as advanced age  male gender  African American race  obesity  compounded by a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking  early-stage chronic kidney disease  and borderline diabetes. All these factors increase his risk for aortic dissection. His combination of severe chest and back pain  as well as his demographic and clinical history  points towards a possible diagnosis of acute aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,52,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year-old African American male  current smoker who has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.   Demographic: As per literature  an aortic dissection tends to occur more frequently in males than in females. It is also more common among people aged 50 and above. African-Americans have a higher risk compared to other races. As a 60-year-old African American male  the patient falls within the highest risk category.  Risk Factors: 1. Hypertension: Patient has long-standing uncontrolled hypertension. Hypertension is the most common risk factor for aortic dissection. 2. Smoking: The patient is a current smoker. Smoking causes damage to the blood vessels  increasing the risk of aortic dissection. 3. Hypercholesterolemia: Patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia. High cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis  which can weaken the aorta and increase the risk of dissection.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Long-standing uncontrolled hypertension predisposes to aortic dissection. 2. Hypercholesterolemia: Chronic high cholesterol levels put the patient at a higher risk of developing atherosclerotic changes  which increases the risk of dissection. 3. Smoking: The patient has a history of long-term heavy smoking  which predisposes to aortic weakening and dissection.  Relevant Symptoms (According to Stanford type A dissection): 1. Severe chest pain that radiates to the back (tearing or ripping)  2. Shortness of breath 3. Loss of consciousness   Based on these findings  a strong clinical suspicion for potential Aortic Dissection is present. Further investigation with imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI should be immediately pursued.
Aortic Dissection,6,53,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Smith Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired civil engineer Living Situation: Lives with Adult Daughter Location: Urban area  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history of hypertension for the past 10 years  poorly controlled  with a maximum reported blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. He is also a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history and follows a diet high in cholesterol and fat leading to a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia 8 years ago. Moreover  he had bicuspid aortic valve surgery 15 years ago. He has no known allergies and does not have any history of diabetes or cancer. He has not been regular with his medications and follow-up appointments.  Family history doesn't reveal any known genetic disorders or conditions linked with cardiovascular health issues. His father passed away at the age of 72 and had a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His mother passed away from breast cancer at the age of 67.  Mr. Smith leads a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. He has a high stress level due to his wife's recent passing.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest and back pain that started about 2 hours ago while he was at home having dinner. The pain was described as a tearing sensation that radiated to his back. He also reported feeling dizziness and shortness of breath.  Problem Representation:  68-year old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a history of smoking and bicuspid aortic valve surgery  presents with acute severe chest and back pain with a tearing sensation  dizziness and shortness of breath. The suspicion of aortic dissection should be high given his risk factors.
Aortic Dissection,6,54,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  who presents to the emergency department feeling severe and sudden chest pain that radiates to his back.   Demographics: 68 years old  African American male. Marginally housed  with inconsistent healthcare access. Retired manual labor worker. Lives alone and has 2 children who live in another state. Smoker for 45 years  consumes alcohol socially.   Past Medical History: Patient has a 10-year history of poorly controlled hypertension and a 4-year history of type II diabetes. Other past medical histories include a previous myocardial infarction 6 years ago and hyperlipidemia. He has a history of poor medication adherence.  Presenting Complaint: Sudden onset of severe chest pain that started an hour ago and has been progressively worsening. The pain is described as tearing or ripping and radiates to his back. Along with the pain  the patient reports feeling short of breath  with associated diaphoresis and feeling faint.  Potential Risk Factors: The patient's age  race  gender  history of longstanding poorly controlled hypertension  and history of smoking pose significant risk factors for aortic dissection. The history of myocardial infarction suggests existing cardiovascular disease  another significant risk factor for aortic dissection.  In this problem representation  the demographic details and the past medical history of the patient align with the literature which shows that aortic dissection is more common in males  individuals in their 60s and 70s  African Americans  individuals with a history of hypertension  smokers  and individuals with heart disease.
Aortic Dissection,6,55,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67 Years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired accountant  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset severe chest pain  Demographics:  John Doe is a retired accountant living with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. His son and grandchildren live in a city nearby and visit often. He used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day  but quit 15 years ago. However  he is occasionally consuming alcohol.   Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been suffering from hypertension and high cholesterol for the last 10 years and has been prescribed medication to manage these conditions.   Family History: His mother died at the age of 77 due to heart failure  and his father died at the age of 80 due to complications from stroke. Both his parents suffered from hypertension.   Patient Summary:  67-year-old male patient  former smoker  and ongoing occasional alcohol consumer presents with sudden onset  severe chest pain. Past medical history includes hypertension & hyperlipidemia. Family history significant for heart disease and stroke.  Based on literature  this patient represents a typical case of aortic dissection. The average age of patients suffering from aortic dissection is around 63 years  with incidence higher in males. The patient's medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol are common risk factors  and his former smoking habit further increases his risk  as does his family history of heart disease. His presentation with acute chest pain also corresponds to typical symptoms of aortic dissection. Thus  the symptoms  history  and context all point toward a likely diagnosis of aortic dissection. However  further diagnostic procedures would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine disease extent.
Aortic Dissection,6,56,"Problem Representation:  1. Patient. Demographic Information:  John  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presents himself as a patient. He is a former smoker and currently works as a manager in a high-stress job. He is about 5'10"""" and weighs 180 lbs indicating a normal body mass index.  2. Presenting Complaint:  John presents with a sudden severe chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes the pain as tearing or ripping. He has a history of hypertension which is not very well controlled. The pain intensified over a period of hours.  3. Past Medical History:  John was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 45. He has a history of heavy smoking for 20 years but quit 10 years back. He also has hyperlipidemia  and a family history of aortic disease.  4. Review of Systems:  John’s hypertension and cholesterol have been managed with medication  but he has expressed difficulty maintaining a strict regimen due to the nature of his job. He endorses feeling the chest pain around the time of waking up.  5. Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be markedly high with differences in upper and lower extremity readings. He is mildly dyspneic but pulses are palpable and symmetrical. Heart sounds appear normal with no murmur.   Relevant Data  Literature-Based:  According to the literature  up to three-quarters of all patients presenting with aortic dissection are male  and most are aged over 60 (Khan et al.  2002). Having an existing condition of hypertension  smoking history  and a family history of the disease increases the risk of developing aortic dissection (Nienaber & Clough  2015). A high-stress job may also contribute to poorly controlled blood pressure  thereby contributing to the risk of aortic dissection. In terms of presenting symptoms  abrupt  severe chest or back pain is the classic symptom most often resulting from the initial aortic tear (Nienaber & Clough  2015). If the area of dissection restricts blood flow  peripheral pulses may differ. Hence  different readings from upper and lower extremities could hint an ongoing aortic dissection. Some may also present with a normal heart exam. This demographic characterization and medical history align closely with the presentation and risk factors found in the existing literature.

Aortic Dissection,6,57,"Patient Profile:  John Brown is a 67-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset and severe chest pain described as """"tearing"""". The pain started about an hour ago when he was out for a morning walk. The pain radiates to his back and Mr. Brown has complained that it is worsening over time  a characteristic which tends to differ from his occasional angina pain.  Demographic Characterization:  John is a retired engineer  a non-smoker  and does not drink alcohol. He lives with his wife in their home. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases - his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Past Medical History:  He has a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  for which he has been having regular follow-ups  though his compliance with the antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications is questionable. He also has a history of stable angina and was prescribed nitroglycerin as and when required. John had a renal stone surgery 20 years ago but has had no recurrence of stones. He does not have any known allergies.  Upon examination  his pulse was irregular and blood pressure readings were vastly different in the right and left arms. His medical provider noted an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  According to the literature  factors such as prolonged hypertension  older age  male sex  and African American ethnicity are known risk factors for aortic dissection. Non-compliance with antihypertensive medication could have led to persistent high blood pressure leading to mechanical stress on the aortic wall. Moreover  his symptoms of severe chest and back pain along with the blood pressure discrepancy in the arms align with typical presentations of aortic dissection  warranting immediate investigation and intervention."
Aortic Dissection,6,58,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker and suffering from hypertension for the past 10 years. The patient has a reported history of drug abuse but has been sober for the past 15 years. He is relatively physically active with a BMI of 28  which lies within the overweight range. He has no known allergies but has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His socio-economic status is medium  and he is retired from a stressful job. He does not have a history of unintentional weight loss  fever  or chills.  Presenting Problem:  The patient presented with sudden onset of severe chest pain  also experienced in the back  and described as a tearing or ripping sensation. The pain began while he was performing household chores and intensified over the next hour. The patient also reports of feeling lightheaded and has experienced bouts of shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for his high blood pressure  including ACE Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers. He has a documented history of high cholesterol levels and was put on a low dose statin 5 years ago. There was also an instance of suspected myocardial infarction 2 years ago  yet angiography did not reveal significant coronary artery disease.

Aortic Dissection,6,59,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 65-year-old - Sex: Male - Race: African American  Demographics: - Occupation: Retired - Marital Status: Married - Education: High School Graduate - Residence: Urban area  Presenting Complaint: - Severe chest pain radiating to the back - Shortness of breath  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 10 years - Tobacco smoking for 40 years - History of high cholesterol for 5 years   Family History: - Father died of aortic dissection at age 55 - Brother has a history of hypertension  Social History: - Patient reports daily alcohol consumption - Smokes one pack of cigarettes daily  This patient representation aligns with the literature suggesting that aortic dissections more commonly affect males  particularly those aged 60-70. It also considers the ethnicity  as it has been shown that African Americans have a higher incidence compared to other ethnic groups. The patient's long history of hypertension  smoking  and high cholesterol are known key risk factors for aortic dissection. The family history of cardiovascular disease further increases this risk. The patient's lifestyle factors  including alcohol and tobacco use  also contribute to the complexity and risk of the case. 
Aortic Dissection,6,60,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 67-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain is described as tearing or ripping  with a 10/10 severity. The patient reports history of hypertension.   Demographics: Age: Studies suggest that the incidence of aortic dissection is higher among older individuals  with the majority of cases occurring in individuals between the ages of 60 and 80. The mean age at presentation is about 63 years. Gender: Aortic dissection is more common in males  with a male to female ratio of about 2:1. Race/Ethnicity: Aortic dissection rates are reportedly higher in Caucasians compared to other races.  Past Medical History: Hypertension: Hypertension is the most common predisposing factor  present in approximately 75% of cases of aortic dissection. Cardiac surgery or catheterization: Procedures that involve the aorta can lead to aortic dissection. Atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis can lead to weakening of the aortic wall  predisposing to aortic dissection. Connective tissue disorders: Disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can increase the risk of aortic dissection. Family history: There is an increased risk of aortic dissection in individuals with a family history of the condition. Cocaine use: Cocaine use can lead to an acute rise in blood pressure  increasing the risk of aortic dissection.  Presenting Symptoms: Chest pain: Severe chest pain is the most common symptom of aortic dissection. It often has a sudden onset and may be described as sharp  tearing  or ripping. Pain radiation: The pain may radiate to the neck  jaw  back  or arms. Syncope: Fainting may occur due to decreased blood flow to the brain. Shortness of breath: This may occur due to involvement of the aortic valve or pulmonary artery  resulting in heart failure. Pulse discrepancy: A difference in pulse between the right and left arms may be noted. Neurologic symptoms: If the dissection involves the carotid arteries  patients may present with stroke-like symptoms.   The problem representation will allow for appropriate diagnostic and management strategies to be implemented  including immediate imaging studies for confirmation of diagnosis and possibly urgent surgical intervention.

Aortic Dissection,6,62,Patient Profile: John Doe  a 65-year old Caucasian male presents himself to the emergency department of the local hospital with sudden  intense chest pain. The pain is characterized as tearing  ripping and radiating to his back  between his shoulder blades.   Smoking History: Patient admitted to having a smoking history of 20 years  with an average of 16 cigarettes a day.   Medical History: John has a history of hypertension  which was diagnosed seven years ago. His hypertension has been poorly controlled (current blood pressure 160/95mmHg) despite being on medication (Lisinopril). He also has a past medical history of aortic aneurysm diagnosed two years ago.   Family Medical History: The patient's family history is noteworthy with his father having died of an aortic aneurysm rupture in his fifth decade of life.   Social History: The patient lives alone  is a widower with no children. He’s a retired engineer  and his diet is primarily fast food due to lack of cooking skills. He consumes alcohol socially in minimal amounts.  Review of other Systems: He denied any symptoms related to other organ systems like breathlessness  palpitations  digestive symptoms  urinary symptoms or fever.   Demographic Representation: Epidemiologic studies suggest that about 60% of aortic dissections occur in males  and the average age at the time of diagnosis is early 60s. Hypertension is prevalent in approximately 75% of cases  while smoking is another prominent risk factor. The Caucasian race is more often affected than others.  From this representation  the patient's risk factors like advanced age  gender  hypertension  aortic aneurysm history  smoking history and family history of aortic disease dramatically inclines towards a diagnosis of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,63,Problem Representation:  Demographics: John Doe is a 65-year-old male living in an urban environment. He identifies as Caucasian and is retired from his previous job as a construction worker. His diet is high in red meat and he has been a smoker for 30 years  with attempts to quit having been unsuccessful in the past.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history with a diagnosis of Hypertension for 15 years  for which he sporadically takes his prescribed medication. He was also diagnosed with Hyperlipidemia 10 years ago and had a Myocardial Infarction (MI) 5 years ago  after which he received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on his left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He was recommended regular exercise and a balanced diet to manage his heart condition  but he has failed to maintain the regime due to a lack of motivation. There is also a family history of heart disease. His father had an MI at the age of 58 and his younger brother was recently diagnosed with angina.  Now  Mr. Doe presents to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe chest and back pain  reason being suspected as a potential Aortic Dissection. His condition may have been precipitated by years of uncontrolled blood pressure  poor diet  smoking history  and a family history of cardiac disease  making him a typical patient for aortic dissection as per literature.  Co-Morbidities: 1. Chronic Hypertension 2. Hyperlipidemia 3. History of Myocardial Infarction 4. Coronary Artery Disease 5. Tobacco addiction  Relevant labs/Tests: Baseline EKG  Cardiac enzymes  Chest X-ray  CT angiography (considered the gold standard test for diagnosing aortic dissection)  D-dimer  and complete blood count.
Aortic Dissection,6,64,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  - Sex: Male - Age: Over 60 - Race/Ethnicity: African American - Lifestyle: Former Smoker and Alcohol Consumer - Occupation: Retired Manual Labor worker  Clinical Features:  - Chief Complaints: Sudden severe chest and back pain described as 'tearing' or 'ripping'; Shortness of breath; Fainting; Rapid Heartbeat; Sweating - History of Present Illness: The patient started having severe chest pain an hour ago that radiated to his back. The patient describes the pain as the worst should ever faced. There was associated shortness of breath  rapid heartbeat  and excessive sweating. He denies any relief from rest and over-the-counter pain medications. - Past Medical History: History of poorly controlled high blood pressure for the past 10 years. He also has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a bypass surgery five years ago. He is known to have high cholesterol levels as well. - Family History: No known family history of heart diseases or conditions  including aortic dissection. His father died of lung cancer  and his mother had diabetes and hypertension. - Social History: The patient was a heavy smoker and drinker until he underwent bypass surgery  after which he quit both.  Physical Examination:  - General Appearance: The patient appears to be in discomfort and distress with excessive perspiration. - Vitals: Blood pressure is significantly different between the two arms  the pulse is rapid and feeble.  - Cardiovascular system: Heart sounds are faint with a diastolic murmur noted. - Respiratory System: Shortness of breath with rapid shallow breathing with otherwise clear lungs.    Diagnostic Evaluation:  - Blood tests: Elevated D-dimer and slightly increased white blood cell count.  - Imaging: CT angiography indicates the presence of an aortic dissection in the ascending aorta. - EKG changes suggestive of left ventricle strain pattern.   Note: The demographic profile is based on the literature that suggests that aortic dissection is more common in males  particularly in their 60s and 70s  and occurs more frequently in individuals of African American and Asian ethnicity. Furthermore  conditions such as hypertension  atherosclerosis  and smoking also increase the risk of having an aortic dissection. The presentation  clinical findings  and diagnostic evaluation mentioned above are typical of a patient presenting with an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,65,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 66-year-old African American male  with a reported body mass index (BMI) of 29.5  indicating obesity. He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and has been a smoker for almost 30 years. There is a family history of both heart disease and high blood pressure.   Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that had radiated to the back  specifically between the shoulder blades. The pain was described as sharp and tearing  starting from the upper front of the chest and moving toward the back. His vitals showed high blood pressure (165/100 mmHg) and a rapid heart rate. The patient also experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath  sweating  and nausea.  Past Medical History:  Longstanding poorly controlled hypertension was evident in his medical record for the last 15 years  and he was irregular on his antihypertensive medication. His dyslipidemia was diagnosed around 10 years ago and he was on statins. He was also a heavy smoker  with around 20 cigarettes/day  and had been smoking for the last 30 years.   Further Examination/Test Result:  A chest X-ray was carried out  which suggested widening of the mediastinum. The suspicion of an aortic dissection was confirmed by a subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA)  which showed a dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending into the descending part.  Note: This is a prototypical scenario and may not represent all cases of aortic dissection.   Sources:  1. Tsai TT  Nienaber CA  Eagle KA. Acute aortic syndromes.

Aortic Dissection,6,66,Patient Information:  John D.  a 60-year-old African-American male  presents himself in the emergency room of a local hospital. His weight is 210 lbs and his height is 6 feet  giving him a BMI of 28.4. He is a high-ranking officer in the military forces and leads a high-stress lifestyle. He reports being a smoker for around 35 years with a pack per day consumption. He also admits to a moderate consumption of alcohol.  Chief Complaint:  John complains of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. He describes it as tearing or ripping. He reports the pain began at rest  and that it is unlike any pain he's previously experienced.   Past Medical History:  Upon review of his past medical history  John has a diagnosis of hypertension  which has been inconsistently controlled over the last ten years. He has been taking anti-hypertensive medication irregularly. He has no history of diabetes  but his cholesterol levels have been on the higher side in his last few regular check-ups. He is not currently on any lipid-lowering medications. There is no history of heart surgeries  but his father died of a heart attack at the age of 65. No history of Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders could be traced in the family history.  On examination:  He appears to be in severe pain and distress with a blood pressure of 155/105 mmHg in his right arm and slightly lower 140/100 mmHg blood pressure in the left arm. His heart rate is 130 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and his oxygen saturation rate is 95% in room air. The cardiovascular system examination revealed a normally located apex beat without any other abnormal findings on auscultation.   Summary:  Based on the chief complaint  medical history  and physical examination  the most likely diagnosis for John is acute aortic dissection  consistent with the demographic pattern of this disease  which typically occurs more commonly in males around the age of 60  particularly in individuals with a history of hypertension and smoking. His ethnic background of being African-American also puts him at a higher risk. A chest x-ray along with further diagnostic procedures including a CT scan or an MRI of the chest might be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The high-stress lifestyle  inconsistent blood pressure control  and familial history of cardiovascular disease add to the complexity of the case. A cardiologist should be on board for further management and risk stratification. The patient should also be counselled on smoking cessation and better control of his hypertension and cholesterol levels.
Aortic Dissection,6,67,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Ray  age 65  Caucasian male  Demographics:  Mr. Ray is a retired school teacher living in a suburban area with his wife. They are financially stable and he has access to good healthcare. He is a smoker and has a 30 pack-year history. He has a sedentary lifestyle with sporadic exercise. He is overweight with a BMI of 27. His diet is typically high in sodium and cholesterol. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Medical History:  Mr. Ray was diagnosed with high blood pressure more than 5 years ago and is on regular antihypertensive medication. He also had a hypercholesterolemia diagnosis 4 years ago for which he takes statin medications. In the past  he has presented with episodes of chest pain  which were diagnosed as angina and treated conservatively. He was hospitalized once for a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 2 years ago. There is a past record of him not being very compliant with his medication.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Ray presents with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is described as tearing in nature and is associated with shortness of breath and sweating. His vitals show high blood pressure and his physical examination is suggestive of heart murmur indicative of aortic regurgitation. He shows signs of neurological deficits suggesting compromised blood supply to some part of his brain. His ECG shows nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  Problem Representation:  The patient is an elderly Caucasian male  with a history of poorly controlled risk factors such as hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking and family history of cardiovascular disease. He presents with severe chest pain of sudden onset radiating to his back  associated symptoms suggestive of compromised heart function and neurological deficits. This scenario is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of aortic dissection  a potentially life-threatening condition requiring urgent evaluation and treatment. His past medical history and the demographic details put him into a high risk category for aortic dissection. His clinical presentation and physical examination further support this potential diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,6,68,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: a 65-year-old African-American male. - Occupation: Retired teacher. - Marital status: Married with two grown children. - Location: Lives in an urban area. - Education: Bachelor's degree.  Presenting Problem:  The patient presents with sudden  severe chest pain that radiates to the back. The pain has been described as tearing and came on suddenly. Accompanied with the intense chest and back pain  the patient is also experiencing shortness of breath  sweating and has fainted once before arriving to the medical facility.   Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure for the past 20 years and has been on medication. However  due to self-neglect and inadequate control of hypertension  the condition has largely been uncontrolled. - Smoking: The patient has a history of heavy smoking  approximately 20 cigarettes per day  for the past 40 years  but quit 5 years ago. - Hyperlipidemia: High cholesterol and triglyceride levels diagnosed for which the patient is on statin medication. - Family History: His father had an aortic dissection at age 70.  Social History:  - Alcohol: Drinks socially  usually one drink during dinner. - Recreational drugs: No history of recreational drug use.  Clinical Findings:  Upon diagnosis  the patient has an elevated blood pressure and heart rate  displaying signs of anxiety. Physical examination reveals a discrepancy in pulse and blood pressure between right and left arm. A systolic murmur  heard best at the right second intercostal space  is also noted during examination. The patient's pain was not alleviated by nitroglycerin administered in the ambulance.  This demographic was chosen as African-American males  over the age of 60 with chronic hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular illnesses have a higher risk factor for aortic dissection. Furthermore  the history of smoking  despite cessation  and hyperlipidemia contribute to the overall increased risk of this patient for aortic dissection. Additionally  high stress (retired teacher) and urban living conditions could also lead to a higher risk of hypertension and subsequent aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,69,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Demographics: 65-year-old Caucasian male. 2. Employment and lifestyle: Retired mechanical engineer  lifetime smoker 20+ cigarettes/day  active lifestyle with regular exercise. 3. Location: Lives in an urban area with easy access to healthcare. 4. Family History: Father died of myocardial infarction at age of 70  mother suffered from hypertension.  Past Medical History: 1. Systemic Hypertension: Patient has a 15 year history of systemic hypertension  while on medication  patient's usual BP readings are around 150/90 mmHg. 2. Smoking: Lifelong smoker  known to be a risk factor for aortic dissection. 3. Lipid disorders: Diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia  treated with statins. 4. Cardiac history: No prior history of MI  but presents with high-risk factor due to family history of heart disease.  Current Clinical Presentation: Patient presents with sudden and severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping sensation. The pain is most severe at the onset and radiates to the back. The patient also experiences shortness of breath  fainting  sweating  and weakness.  Assuming assessment and diagnostic testing confirm it  this presentation would be typical for an aortic dissection.   Relevant Statistics for problem representation (as per literature): 1. Aortic dissection is more common in men (ratio 2:1) and people older than 60. 2. 72% of the patients have hypertension. 3. Smoking doubles the risk of aortic dissection. 4. About one fourth of patients who face aortic dissection have hyperlipidemia. 5. 30% of patients have a history of heart disease. 6. The most common presentation is severe chest pain (85% of patients).  In conclusion  management of this typical patient should focus on controlling blood pressure  cessation of smoking  and maintaining controlled cholesterol levels. As this might be an emergency condition  it requires immediate medical attention aiming at reducing mortality and morbidity.

Smoking status: Smoker for 40 years. 6. Alcohol: Moderate drinker. 7. Weight: Slightly overweight (BMI 27). 8. Medications: None. 9. Family history: Father had a heart attack at age 65.  Results of Examination:  1. Chief Complaint: Severe and sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back  along with shortness of breath. 2. Vital Signs: Blood pressure 150/100 mm Hg; heart rate 100 beats per minute; respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; temperature 37.2 °C. 3. Physical Exam: Diaphoretic  decreased breath sounds on the left side  faint pulse in the left leg. 4. Laboratory exam: Negative troponin  high D-dimer (>1000 ng/mL).  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. 2. Managed with lifestyle changes alone; currently uncontrolled. 3. History of high cholesterol; not on statins. 4. No history of diabetes  malignancy  or other chronic illnesses. 5. Previous diagnostic tests indicate normal coronary arteries.  Problem List:  1. Acute onset chest pain  radiating to the back. 2. Shortness of breath. 3. Diaphoresis. 4. Hypertension. 5. Hyperlipidemia. 6. Cigarette smoking. 7. Family history of heart attack. 8. High D-dimer levels.  Patient's Probable Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation and history  the patient likely is experiencing an aortic dissection.  Note: Epidemiological studies show that aortic dissection has a higher preponderance among males. It is also more common among Caucasians. Major risk factors include hypertension  which the patient has  a history of smoking (present in this case)  and age above 60 years. Thus  this patient fits the typical profile of someone who may suffer from an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,71,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 67-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension and tobacco use. Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. He has a Body mass index of 26 and resides in an urban area.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with a severe  sudden-onset chest pain  which he describes as sharp and ripping  radiating to his back. He also reports feeling faint and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a ten-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and has been a smoker for 30 years averaging a pack every day. Previous assessments showed an enlarged proximal ascending aorta. He has also been treated on several occasions for chest infections due to his continued smoking. He has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  The patient is a retired construction worker  lives alone  and is partially dependent on social services for support. He is a non-drinker but has been a heavy smoker for over three decades.  Family History:  There is a family history of ischemic heart disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction in his 70s and his mother of a stroke in her late 60s. His elder brother is receiving treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Working Diagnosis:   Based on the patient's history  presenting symptoms  and risk factors  a working diagnosis of aortic dissection is made. Immediate further investigations  such as CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta  are required to confirm the diagnosis and identify the Stanford classification of the dissection.  Note:  Aortic dissection incidences are more frequent amongst males  aged 60-70  and in those with a history of hypertension. A meta-analysis revealed that African-Americans have a greater risk for aortic dissection compared to Caucasians. Heavy smokers and genetic predisposition also elevate the risk.  Plan: 1. Immediate hemodynamic stabilization 2. Immediate diagnostic confirmation 3. Prepare for possible surgical intervention 4. Address modifiable risk factors  i.e.  patient education to quit smoking and control hypertension.   References: 1. Clouse WD  Hallett JW Jr  Schaff HV  Gayari MM  Ilstrup DM  Melton LJ 3rd.

Aortic Dissection,6,72,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department.  Present Issues and Symptoms:  The patient reports experiencing severe chest pain radiating to the back  along with shortness of breath that started abruptly about 2 hours ago. He describes the pain as a tearing sensation  and rates it a 10 on a scale of 1-10. The patient also shows signs of anxiety and is sweating profusely.   Medical History: The patient's past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension  for which he has been taking amlodipine and lisinopril for over 15 years. He was diagnosed with moderate atherosclerosis five years ago but has managed to control it with diet  regular exercise and taking atorvastatin. He has also been a smoker for the past 30 years  with an average consumption of 10 cigarettes per day. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 years.  Recent Issues:  His blood pressure at presentation is 180/120 mmHg  which is higher than usual  as he typically maintains a blood pressure around 140/90 mmHg.   Demographics:  The patient is a retired engineer who lives with his wife. He has two adult children who live out of state. He is financially stable and has a well-rooted social support system. He does not report any recent travel or changes in his daily activities.  Based on this patient's profile - particularly his age  gender  longstanding  poorly controlled hypertension  a history of atherosclerosis  and his habit of smoking - he is at a significantly increased risk for acute aortic dissection. Literature suggests that the average age of people with aortic dissection is around 63 years  with men being affected twice as often as women. Additionally  aortic dissection is more frequently observed in Caucasians compared to other ethnic groups. His symptoms of severe chest pain  hypertension  and increased anxiety further support the suspicion of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,73,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 67-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  is presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was associated with cold sweating and nausea  however with no signs of loss of consciousness.   Demographics:  The patient is a retired carpenter  a long-term smoker who consumes alcohol moderately. He lives with his wife and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father and older brother both dying of heart attacks at early ages.  Current symptoms: The chest pain was sudden and intense  peaking within seconds  described as """"tearing"""" and located in the front of the chest. The pain then migrated to the back. Patient reported associated episodes of nausea and cold sweating.   Past medical history: Patient has a known history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled with medication for several years. In addition he has a history of smoking 1 pack a day for approximately 30 years which has likely contributed to arterial damage. He quit smoking 5 years ago. There's no history of diabetes  hypercholesterolemia or any significant infectious diseases.   Family history: His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his older brother suffered from a similar event at the age of 60.  Social history: The patient is married  has two children  and is currently retired. He is a social drinker and quit smoking 5 years ago.  Allergies: No known allergies.  Current medications: Patient is currently taking Lisinopril and Amlodipine for his hypertension.  Summary: Based on the sudden onset of severe chest pain described as 'tearing' that radiated to the back  and the patient's history of chronic hypertension and smoking  the presentation is suggestive of an aortic dissection. This condition is more common in males in their 60s to 70s  and hypertension is a known risk factor. The fact that this patient is African American also coincides with the literature that suggests this demographic group is at an increased risk compared to other ethnic groups."
Aortic Dissection,6,74,Problem Representation:  Demographics: - Patient Name: John Doe - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired mechanic - Marital Status: Married  Symptoms: - Sudden severe chest pain - Fast heartbeat - Shortness of breath - Sweating - Nausea and vomiting  - Faintness  Relevant Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Known atherosclerosis - Previous thoracic injury - Smoker for 40 years  recently quit 5 years ago  Family History: - Father died from stroke at age 72 - Mother died from heart disease at age 69  Findings from Physical Examination: - Blood pressure: 150 / 95 mmHg - Heart rate: 105 beats per minute - ECG: Deviation from normal results; irregular heartbeat - Chest X-Ray: Widened mediastinum  This problem representation reflects the typical patient demographics and presentation of an aortic dissection according to the general understanding of the condition's epidemiology. It has been established through multiple international studies that aortic dissections are most common in older males  particularly those with risk factors such as hypertension  atherosclerosis  cardiac injury  and smoking history. The described sudden onset of severe chest pain  increased heart rate  and shortness of breath are common indicators of aortic dissection  and the ECG and chest X-ray findings are also consistent with this condition. These symptoms  in combination with the patient’s demographic characteristics and medical history  create a high index of suspicion for an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,75,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: John Doe  a 70-year-old non-Hispanic Caucasian male  presents symptoms including sudden severe chest pain  racing heart  loss of consciousness  and leg pain.   Family History: The patient reports a family history of several cases of cardiovascular diseases particularly hypertension.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) and arterial disease. The patient also reported being a regular smoker for over 40 years (2 packs/day)  has high cholesterol level  and is slightly overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28. No history related to connective tissue disorders like Marfan Syndrome or inflammatory conditions was reported.  Epidemiological Background: His profile aligns with the typical demographic representation of aortic dissection patients. Aortic dissection predominantly affects males approximately in the age range of 60-70  and non-Hispanic whites are represented at a higher frequency when compared to other races. Risk factors prevalent in the patient's medical history - such as long-term hypertension  atherosclerosis  and tobacco use - are among the leading causes of aortic dissection as confirmed by current literature.   Main Problem: Given the patient's demographic  medical history  and symptomatic presentation  it is highly suggestive of aortic dissection  therefore immediate medical attention and further diagnostic tests are warranted.   Supportive Findings: His family history of hypertension  personal history of high blood pressure  being a regular smoker for a significant period of time  history of arterial disease  and current presentation of severe chest pain  loss of consciousness  fast heart rate  and leg pain strongly support the suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Hypotheses to Pursue: The primary hypothesis is aortic dissection  particularly Type A dissection due to reported chest pain. Alternative diagnoses could potentially be myocardial infarction  pericarditis  or pulmonary embolism.   Plan: Immediate diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray  an ECG  an MRI  or a transesophageal echocardiogram should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection. If confirmed  it requires immediate medical or surgical intervention. 
Aortic Dissection,6,76,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male. 2. Socio-economic status: The patient has a middle-class socio-economic status and is retired from his job. 3. Health History: The patient has a history of smoking and is a habitual drinker. He has been on hypertensive medication for over 15 years. Also  the patient has a family history of cardiac disorders. 4. Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Problem Situation: 1. Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with severe chest pain  which he describes as 'tearing' and radiating to the back. The pain is sudden and came on without warning. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  fainting  and rapid pulse. 2. Time: The patient was rushed into the hospital's emergency room. 3. Duration: The patient states the pain started just a couple of hours ago and has been persistent.  Medical Examination Results: 1. Vital Signs: High blood pressure of 176/120 mmHg. Heart rate is pounding and slightly irregular at 110 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation is lower than usual at 89% on room air. 2. Physical Findings: Upon examination  differential blood pressure in the arms is observed. The murmur of aortic insufficiency can be heard on auscultation. 3. Lab Tests: D-dimer levels are elevated. 4. Diagnostic Imaging: Chest X-Ray showed the mediastinal widening. Follow-up computed tomography angiogram (CTA) shows aortic dissection.  `Relevant Background Information: Aortic dissection is a relatively rare but fatal disease that mainly affects elderly males. The incidence rate is slightly higher in the African American population. Studies show the majority of AD patients are hypertensives. Other risk factors include smoking  dyslipidemia  pre-existing aortic aneurysm  and bicuspid aortic valve disease. The classic symptom of an aortic dissection is severe 'tearing' chest pain  which can radiate to the back. Certain physical examination findings and diagnostic tools are used to confirm the diagnosis. Immediate treatment is often required to prevent severe complications such as aortic rupture.
Aortic Dissection,6,77,Patient Profile: Patient J.D. is a 65-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his back.  Past Medical History: Patient has a significant past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension over the past 20 years. He also has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 2 years ago. He has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases with his father dying of a heart attack at the age of 50.   Presenting Symptoms: Patient reports a sudden onset of severe chest pain with a tearing or ripping sensation which started an hour ago while he was taking a walk around the neighborhood. The pain then spread to his upper back. The patient appears pale and anxious  and his heart rate and blood pressure are elevated.  Demographic Representation: Based on literature  the majority of patients with aortic dissection are males above the age of 60. Smoking and hypertension are major risk factors for aortic dissections. Furthermore  black individuals have been found to have a higher risk of aortic dissections compared to other racial backgrounds.   Relevant Information: Aortic dissection is an emergency condition where the large blood vessel branching off the heart (aorta) tears. Hypertension and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) can increase a person's risk of aortic dissection. Other risk factors can be a history of bicuspid aortic valve  aorta inflammation due to conditions such as vasculitis  and a family history of aortic dissection. The clinical presentation of an acute aortic dissection can mimic other cardiovascular emergencies  resulting in delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity and mortality.   Conclusion: Thus considering the high-risk patient's history and presenting symptoms  a prompt evaluation of the aorta via imaging is indicated to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,6,78,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 66-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department. He is an ex-smoker with a past medical history of hypertension and atherosclerosis. He is currently on antihypertensive medication. His BMi is 27. He has a family history of aortic disease.  Presenting Problem: The patient complains of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back  suggestive of aortic dissection.  Past Medical history: 1. Hypertension: He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been taking antihypertensives regularly. However  his blood pressure has been poorly controlled.  2. Atherosclerosis: He was diagnosed three years ago when he presented with claudication. He was managed conservatively.  3. Smoking: He smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years  but quit five years ago.  4. Family History: His father died from an aneurysm at age 67.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient had a blood pressure of 175/115 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and was in visible distress. Heart sounds were faint. There was discrepancy in blood pressure measurements between his right and left arms.  Diagnostic Assessment: Based on his symptoms and findings  he was suspected to have an aortic dissection. An immediate CT angiography was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of an ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A).  Plan: Given the patient’s presentation and confirmation of aortic dissection  he was referred for immediate surgical intervention - repair or replacement of the dissected aorta.  This problem representation showcases features that are typical of an aortic dissection  including the risk factors (hypertension  atherosclerosis)  presenting symptoms (chest pain)  important diagnostic indicators (discrepancy in blood pressure between arms)  and the indicated treatment (surgical intervention).
Aortic Dissection,6,79,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Residential Area: Suburban  Complaint: Sudden chest pain and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Hypertension  Frozen shoulder  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  history of smoking (1 pack/day for the last 40 years)  and High cholesterol. No prior history of cardiovascular surgeries. Father died of aortic aneurysm. Compliance with medications is inconsistent.   Lifestyle: Sedentary with a diet rich in high cholesterol foods. History of heavy alcohol consumption.  Medications: Beta-blockers  statins  Bronchodilators for COPD  Diagnostics: Abnormal chest x-ray; echocardiogram suggests aortic dissection  Details:  Mr. Doe is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired and living in a suburban area. He has a medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both potentially contributing to aortic pathology. Additionally  he has COPD likely secondary to his history of heavy smoking  and a prior incidence of frozen shoulder.  Mr. Doe reports sudden onset chest pain  radiating to the back and is also experiencing shortness of breath. He has been taking medication for his hypertension (beta-blockers) and high cholesterol (statins) but admits his compliance is sporadic which may have exacerbated his current condition.  Given his family history of aortic aneurysm (father)  there is a heightened concern regarding his presenting symptoms. His lifestyle habits  including lack of physical activity  a diet rich in high cholesterol foods  alcohol abuse  and a history of heavy smoking  have likely contributed to his medical conditions.  His recent echocardiogram and chest X-rays have indicated the presence of aortic dissection  which explains his symptomatic complaints and is consistent with his personal and family medical history. The priority would be to manage the aortic dissection to prevent any further complications and to revise his hypertensive and cholesterol management plans to prevent future vascular events.

His symptoms include sharp and tearing chest pain that began very suddenly and has been consistent for 2 hours. He also complains of pain in his back. He has no known allergies or other medical conditions. Smith’s father died due to cardiovascular disease at the age of 70  which also relates to some genetic predisposition.""""  2. """"Ms. Johnson is a 50-year-old Caucasian female who presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain  radiating to her back and varying in intensity. She has a known history of Marfan Syndrome  a condition associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection. She doesn't smoke and tries to minimize alcohol intake. Her father underwent surgery for an aortic aneurysm in his 60s.""""  Based on existing literature  demographic and health characteristics associated with higher risk of aortic dissection include:  - Age: Majority of aortic dissections occur in individuals aged 50-70 years. - Sex: Men have twice the likelihood as women to suffer from an aortic dissection  although women have higher mortality rates. - Race: Aortic dissection is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. - Hypertension: Chronic hypertension contributes to approximately 75% of all aortic dissections. - Smoking: Tobacco use can damage and weaken the aortic wall  increasing the risk of aortic dissection. - Hereditary Disorders: Conditions such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause weakness in the aortic wall  predisposing patients to aortic dissection. Patient's with a family history of aortic disease can also be at a higher risk. - Previous Heart Surgery: Aortic dissection can occur as a complication of heart surgery.   Understanding these factors helps to formulate an appropriate and realistic problem representation. It's crucial to always personalize care and treatment based on individual patient demographics  lifestyles  and comorbidities."
Aortic Dissection,6,81,Patient Profile:  Demographics: - Age: 65 years - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer - Location: Urban  Past Medical History: 1. High blood pressure (Hypertension) - Patient has a longstanding history of hypertension. Despite the usage of several antihypertensives  it has been difficult to control. Patient's last blood pressure reading was 150/95 mmHg. 2. Atherosclerosis - Patient's medical records indicate an episode of myocardial infarction (heart attack) about 8 years ago. Subsequent angiography has revealed atherosclerosis with moderately reduced left ventricular function. 3. Smoking - Patient has a 40 pack-year smoking history but claims to have quit about a decade ago. 4. Family history - Patient's father passed away from an aneurysm at the age of 70. 5. Diabetes - Patient has type II diabetes mellitus and is currently on Metformin. 6. Hyperlipidemia - Patient has high cholesterol and is under medication (Statins). 7. Chronic kidney disease - Likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes.  According to numerous studies  the average age of patients presenting with aortic dissection tends to be in their 60s or 70s  with a belated presentation in women. The condition is predominantly found in Caucasian males  and those with a history of high blood pressure are particularly at risk. Furthermore  an association with atherosclerosis  smoking history  underlying vascular disease  family history of aneurysm  and history of heart conditions have also been shown.  Given the patient profile stated above and relevant statistics from the literature  the risk of aortic dissection appears quite considerable. Therefore  any acute onset  severe chest or back pain in such a patient warrants the instant consideration for diagnostic testing for aortic dissection. This could involve imaging studies like CT  MRI or a transesophageal echocardiogram.
Aortic Dissection,6,82,Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a longstanding history of hypertension and smoking. He has a body mass index of 28 suggesting overweight status. His other past medical history includes hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic renal disease. There is also a recorded familial history of cardiovascular diseases.  Chief Complaint: The patient mainly complained of sudden onset of tearing or ripping chest pain that radiated to his back.  Presenting Symptoms: Apart from the chest pain  other reported symptoms included dizziness  fainting  sweating  nausea  shortness of breath  and weakness or paralysis on one side of the body. Upon physical examination  there was a noted discrepancy in blood pressure between the right and left arms  and a faint pulse.  Relevant History: The patient’s history of hypertension is significant and has been poorly controlled  with the patient admitting non-adherence to antihypertensive medications. His smoking history spans over 40 years with a 20 pack-year history.   Patient's medication history includes metformin for type 2 diabetes  statins for hyperlipidemia  and several antihypertensive medications. He also takes aspirin daily due to his risk for cardiovascular diseases. There is no known drug allergy.  Literature Review: The patient's demographic and medical history align with typical risk factors for aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is more common in males over the age of 60 (Tsai TT  et.al.  2005)  especially those with hypertension (Hiratzka LF  et.al.  2010). In addition  cigarette smoking is also associated with an increased risk for aortic dissection by causing degenerative changes to the aortic wall (Goldfinger JZ  et.al.  2014). Furthermore  the presence of atherosclerosis represented in this patient via hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes  significantly contributes to the risk of aortic dissection (Prakash S  et.al.  2010).

Aortic Dissection,6,83,Problem Representation:  Demographics:  - Age: The typical patient with aortic dissection is often between 60 and 80 years old  with a mean age of 63 years. - Gender: Aortic dissection is more common in men compared to women. The male to female ratio is approximately 2:1 to 3:1. - Race: The incidence of aortic dissection is higher in African Americans compared to Caucasians.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Hypertension is the most common risk factor present in up to 70% of all cases of aortic dissections. This makes it important for any hypertensive patient to have this condition well-controlled to minimize potential risks.  2. Genetic connective tissue disorders: Patients with genetic conditions such as Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome are highly susceptible to aortic dissection due to their weakened connective tissues.  3. Bicuspid aortic valve: This congenital heart defect contributes to an increased risk of aortic dissection.  4. History of heart surgery or catheter procedures: Previous heart procedures like valve replacement surgery  cardiac catheterization  or aortic aneurysm repair can increase the susceptibility to aortic dissection.  5. Cocaine usage: Substance abuse  particularly cocaine  can result in temporary hypertension which may cause aortic dissection.   6. Atherosclerosis: Hardening of the arteries due to a buildup of plaque makes the aorta more susceptible to tears.  7. Family history: There is a higher risk of developing an aortic dissection if a first-degree relative has had the condition.   8. Previous history of aortic dissection: Patients who have had an aortic dissection before have a higher chance of having another.  This is a basic problem representation. Depending on the patient's specific case  other demographic factors like body mass index (BMI)  lipid profile  smoking status  etc. may also be relevant.
Aortic Dissection,6,84,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   A 65-year-old African American male presenting with sudden severe chest or upper back pain  described as a tearing or ripping sensation. Patient's vitals are within normal limits  but BP is slightly high. He has noticeable differences in blood pressure between arms  which can be an indicative of aortic dissection.   Demographic Characteristics:   Based on literature  the patient falls into the highest risk demographic for aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is most common in men  is generally more prevalent between the ages of 60 and 70  and is more frequently seen in African Americans compared to Caucasians.   Relevant Past Medical History:   1. Patient has a record of uncontrolled hypertension. Hypertension is a major risk factor for aortic dissection.  2. Patient underwent a coronary bypass surgery seven years ago. History of vascular surgeries could potentially predispose the patient to develop aortic dissections.  3. Patient's father died due to rupture of aortic aneurysm  suggesting a possible genetic predisposition.  4. Patient is a reformed smoker and quit smoking after his bypass surgery. Smoking is typically considered to be a risk factor for aortic dissection.  5. Further  the patient suffers from mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  which may complicate overall healthcare outcomes if he indeed has an aortic dissection.  This diverse yet connected set of risk variables makes him a typical candidate for an aortic dissection suspicion. The severe chest or upper back pain  described as a tearing or ripping sensation  coupled with his demographic and personal medical and family history  point to a sufficient cause to consider aortic dissection in the diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,6,85,Patient Representation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  presents with an acute severe onset of tearing chest pain radiating to the back. He mentions having experienced shortness of breath  fainting spells  and sudden difficulty speaking. Further  he has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  and cigarette smoking of about a pack per day for the last 40 years. There's a documented case of aortic dissection in his immediate family. He has also had an endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm 5 years ago. Lastly  he also has a history of coronary artery disease  resulting in myocardial infarction three years back for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and was placed on low-dose aspirin therapy.   Problem Representation:  This is a representation of a 67-year-old Hispanic male with cardiovascular risk factors (uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  family history of aortic dissection  previous aortic aneurysm repair  history of coronary artery disease with treated myocardial infarction)  presenting with acute onset of severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back. The patient's symptoms  family history and lifestyle conditions including smoking and uncontrolled hypertension heighten the suspicion of aortic dissection. His heart-related history and features of the presentation also raise considerations for acute coronary syndrome.   Note: The above problem representation is based on the fact that aortic dissection is more common among males and older adults  with an average age of onset in the early 60s. Hypertension is present in a majority of cases  with smoking and a history of aortic disease also common risk factors. Hispanic ethnicity is not specifically associated with increased risk  but has been included here for representative purposes. As per literature  aortic dissection can lead to myocardial infarction  stroke and other severe consequences if not rapidly diagnosed and treated. This man's risk factors and symptoms place him in a high-risk category for this life threatening condition.
Aortic Dissection,6,86,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired from an executive position which was highly stressful. He is presenting with an acute onset of severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping and radiating to the back. He has been a smoker for over 40 years  consuming approximately one pack per day  and has a regular moderate intake of alcohol. His weight is in the obese range (BMI: 32.5) height: 5'10"""" and his physical activity is minimal.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history which includes essential hypertension  managed with daily medication (Amlodipine 5mg  Metoprolol 50mg) for over 20 years. The patient also has a history of atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. Additionally  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 15 years ago and is on a statin. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago due to a history of coronary artery disease.  Family History: There is a known family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and brother dying from myocardial infarctions in their 60s. There is no known family history of connective tissue disorders or genetic conditions related to the cardiovascular system.  Clinical Examination: On arrival  the patient is in moderate distress  sweating profusely. Pulse rate: 110/min  BP: 160/110 mmHg in the right arm and 145/90 mmHg in the left arm. Examination reveals diminished pulse in the left femoral artery compared to the right. Chest auscultation reveals no lung abnormalities but a loud diastolic murmur heard on the left sternal border. The patient presents with unequal pupils  left pupil dilated more than right indicating probable neurological involvement.  In this scenario  we have described a typical elderly male patient with several risk factors for aortic dissection  such as advanced age  chronic hypertension  atherosclerotic disease  smoking and obesity. He presents with classic symptoms of aortic dissection  including severe chest pain radiating to the back and unequal blood pressures in the arms. The clinical examination findings also point towards a probable diagnosis of aortic dissection with cardio-vascular and neurological involvement. His medical history of long-term hypertension and cardiac diseases — both significant risk factors — coupled with immediate family history of cardiovascular disease  aligns accurately with the demographic representation found in the literature for aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,6,87,Problem Representation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old  African American male with a BMI of 28 has been admitted to the emergency department presenting with an intense  sharp pain in his chest and back. The pain began suddenly and is radiating down to his abdomen. There are symptoms of shortness of breath  fainting  and weakness on one side of the body but no history of trauma.   Past medical history reveals that Mr. Doe is suffering from chronic hypertension for the last ten years and has been regularly taking antihypertensive medication. Along with that  there is a record of less controlled diabetes mellitus for the past seven years. He also has a positive history of smoking 1 pack/day for the last 25 years. There had been an episode five years ago of transient ischemic attack (TIA) but since then no neurological deficits were reported.  Personal history suggests that he is retired and lives with his wife. Consumes alcohol socially but there's no known history of substance abuse. His father died of myocardial infarction and his mother passed away due to stroke  indicating a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.  On examination  there is a recorded blood pressure discrepancy  with the left arm showing increased blood pressure compared to the right. His pulse rate is high and has irregular rhythm. Breath sounds are observed to be normal. Neurological evaluation reveals decreased strength in his right arm and leg.  In summary  a hypertensive  obese  African American male smoker with diabetes mellitus and a family history of cardiovascular disease presents with severe chest and back pain  shortness of breath  fainting  and an episode of weakness on one side of the body suggestive of a possible aortic dissection. Further validation through imaging modalities like Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)  Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)  CT scan  or MRI of the aorta is warranted.
Aortic Dissection,6,88,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Sex: Male Age: 63 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Medical History: John is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago and has a documented history of moderate-to-high alcohol intake. He has hypertension which he has been managing for the past 10 years with medication. He also has hypercholesterolemia and familial history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). His father died of a heart attack at 70. He underwent an angioplasty 5 years back due to significant narrowing of the coronary artery diagnosed during a routine check-up. He is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 and is sedentary.  John reports he has been under a lot of stress lately  which he primarily attributes to personal reasons. He has been compliant with his prescribed medications  including antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. He has no history of diabetes or chronic lung disease.  Presenting Complaint: John presented at the emergency department with sudden onset tearing chest pain radiating to the back. He also reported shortness of breath and profuse sweating. His blood pressure was noted to be significantly higher than his usual readings  and asymmetric between his arms.  Representation of the Problem: Given John’s demographics  his underlying risk factors (hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  family history of CVD  former smoking and alcohol habits  overweight  sedentary lifestyle  and stress)  and the nature characteristic of his symptoms  a preliminary diagnosis of suspected aortic dissection is deduced. The asymmetric blood pressure adds considerable weight to this suspicion. Further diagnostic testing including computed tomography angiography (CTA) would be required for confirmation.
Aortic Dissection,6,89,"Problem Representation: Aortic Dissection  Demographics: Patient is a 65-year old African-American male.  Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension  high cholesterol  history of mild atherosclerosis  and past smoking habits. In addition  there is a family history of cardiovascular disease  specifically his father had an aortic aneurysm. He had previously been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue  which is a known risk factor for aortic dissection.  Presenting Complaint and Symptoms: Patient presented complaining of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back and described it as a """"ripping or tearing"""" feeling. In addition  the patient reports experiencing shortness of breath.  Analysis: Based on the patient's demographic characteristics  such as age and race  and significant past medical history with factors that can predispose to an aortic dissection  such as hypertension  atherosclerosis  history of smoking  and a genetic predisposition (Marfan syndrome)  the patient is at a high risk of the condition.  The sudden severe chest pain described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping""""  the back pain and the shortness of breath are common symptoms of an aortic dissection. According to literature  the incidence of aortic dissection is higher in males  individuals over the age of 60  and African Americans.  Additional investigations such as imaging tests (CT scan  MRI  or aortic angiography) are required for a confirmed diagnosis  followed by aggressive management to prevent fatal outcomes.  This representation is based on commonly reported demographic data and clinical features of patients with aortic dissection in the literature and can guide the healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases based on high-risk factors and typical presentations."
Aortic Dissection,6,90,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:   - Age: 62 years old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Residence: Urban environment  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: The patient has been suffering from primary hypertension for the last 20 years. Blood pressure has typically been poorly controlled.  2. Dyslipidemia: Documented history of abnormal cholesterol and/or triglyceride concentrations in the bloodstream over the past 10 years demonstrating a risk factor for aortic disease.  3. Marfan Syndrome: Patient diagnosed with this genetic disorder around 20 years ago  affecting connective tissue and increases the risk of aortic dissection.  4. Family History: Father died from aortic dissection at 65 years old  showing a definite genetic predisposition.  5. Smoking: The patient is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history which contributes to the risk of aortic degeneration and dissection.  6. Cocaine Use: Patient admitted to using cocaine sporadically in the past.  7. Bicuspid Aortic Valve: Diagnosed in his early 40s  this congenital heart disease may contribute to aortic dissection.  Presenting Current Complications:  The patient came to the emergency department presenting with severe chest pain that began suddenly. The pain is described as sharp and tearing  radiating to the back. This was accompanied by lightheadedness and shortness of breath.   Note: Aortic dissection is more common in men than in women  and more common among people in their 60's-70's. Hypertension is the most common condition associated with aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome  a disease that causes abnormal fibrillin  increasing the risk of aortic dissection  and family history are important risk factors. Tobacco and cocaine use have also been associated with an increase in risk.

Clinical Presentation: Onset: Sudden Index episode: Chest pain coupled with shortness of breath Severity: Severe  Existing time-span: Lasting the previous 24 hours Evolution: Progressive Associated symptoms: Nausea  profuse sweating  fainting Family history: No immediate family history of aortic dissection.  Past Medical/Surgical History: 1. Hypertension - Diagnosed 12 years ago  controlled with medication 2. Hyperlipidemia - Diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled with statins 3. Type 2 Diabetes - Diagnosed 8 years ago  on metformin 4. Menopause at age 54 5. Sustained minor injuries in a car accident 15 years ago  no surgical history. 6. Remote history of a chest wall tumor  resected with no recurrence.  Current Medication: 1. Amlodipine for Hypertension 2. Simvastatin for Hyperlipidemia 3. Metformin for Diabetes  Major Illness History: 1. Hypertension 2. Hyperlipidemia 3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 4. Chest Wall Tumor 5. Menopause  Review of Systems: Tachycardia (heart rate over 100 bpm)  high blood pressure  difficulty breathing  and weakness.  Physical Findings: Pain worse with respiratory movements  displaced cardiac pulsations  differential blood pressure readings in arms.  Investigation: Computed tomography (CT) scan scheduled to confirm aortic dissection.  Plan: Immediate hospitalization with possible surgery  control of blood pressure  pain management  consultation with cardiac surgeon. Blood glucose level will also need to be managed due to the patient's diabetes. If aortic dissection is confirmed  appropriate treatment measures will be taken immediately.
Aortic Dissection,6,93,"Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heavy tobacco use. He has not been medically compliant and has a previous history of nonattendance to scheduled medical examinations. He is socially active  does not consume alcohol but has a known history of consuming tobacco.   Presentation: The chief complaints are sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back  loss of consciousness  and shortness of breath. The pain is described as """"tearing """" """"ripping """" or """"stabbing"""". He also reports mild confusion  slurred speech and difficulty in walking  suggesting possible involvement of the brain's blood flow.   Medical History: His past medical history includes control of hypertension which has been poorly controlled. His most recent blood pressure recording was 150/95 mmHg  indicating uncontrolled hypertension. Additionally  the patient has led a sedentary life with a poor diet (high in fats  cholesterol and salts).  Family History: A significant family history includes his father who passed away due to heart disease. His mother has hypertension  and his older sibling died from a cerebrovascular accident.   Laboratory Findings and Imaging: His EKG shows abnormal changes and a CT scan indicates the presence of abnormal widening of the aortic arch and descending aorta suggestive of an aortic dissection.  This overall picture is typical of a patient at risk of an aortic dissection  with crucial risk factors such as age  genetic predisposition  uncontrolled hypertension  and lifestyle factors such as heavy tobacco use and a poor diet. It's also consistent with literature which presents that the majority of aortic dissection patients are male  over the age of 60  with a history of smoking and hypertension."
Aortic Dissection,6,94,Problem Representation:  Demographics:   A 67-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden severe chest pressure occurring over a span of 4 hours.  Past Medical History (PMH):  1. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 12 years. The patient has been inconsistently adherent to prescribed antihypertensive medications such as Amlodipine 5mg daily.  2. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has had high cholesterol levels  managed with simvastatin 20mg daily for more than 10 years.  3. Aortic Aneurysm: Diagnosed 3 years back during an abdominal ultrasound for an unrelated ailment.   4. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  managed with angioplasty and stent placement at that time.  5. Tobacco use: 30 pack-years history of smoking  quit 2 years ago.  6. Family history: Father died at the age of 74 due to an aortic dissection.  Social history:  The patient currently lives alone  after the death of his spouse a year ago. He is a retired engineer and denies any personal history of alcohol or illicit substance use.  Review of Systems:  Positive for chest pain  light-headedness  and shortness of breath. Denied any symptoms of fever  cough  abdominal pain  loss of consciousness  palpitations  or lower extremity swelling.  On physical exam:  Blood pressure (BP): 180/100 mmHg Pulse: 90 beats per minute Temperature (T): 98.6 ºF (37°C) Respiratory rate (RR): 16 breaths per minute Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 97% on room air Neurological: Normal Cardiovascular: Tachycardic  no murmur Respiratory: Clear to auscultation Gastrointestinal: Soft  non-tender Extremities: No edema  By taking into account the race  age  and gender of the individual represented in this case  as well as the patient's prior medical history  this case falls within the demographic criteria generally reported in the literature for potential aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is seen more commonly in men  those with a history of high blood pressure  and people over the age of 60.
Aortic Dissection,6,95,Demographic Characterization:  1. Age: The patient is a 65-year-old male. 2. Race: Predominantly seen in persons of African descent. 3. Preexisting Genetic Condition: Connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 4. Lifestyle Habits: The patient is a heavy smoker with a history of high alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  1. Cardiovascular: History of hypertension (most significant risk factor)  atherosclerosis  and previous cardiac surgery. 2. Pulmonary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to heavy smoking. 3. Renal: Chronic kidney disease stage III secondary to longstanding hypertension. 4. Other: Family history of aortic dissection or other aortic diseases. History of trauma or injury to the chest.  Problem Representation:  This individual represents a high-risk profile for aortic dissection due to his demographic characteristics and past medical history. His age  heavy smoking  alcohol consumption  untreated hypertension  and chronic kidney disease have each contributed to a potentially weakened arterial wall. This increases the risk of an intimal tear and subsequent aortic dissection. The presence of a family history of aortic diseases and his African descent further contribute to the risk. Overall  the likelihood of acute aortic dissection in this patient is considerably higher  and any chest pain or related symptoms should prompt immediate evaluation for this life-threatening condition.
Aortic Dissection,6,96,Problem Representation:  Background Information:  Patient: Mr. Austin  a 65-year-old African-American male Presenting complaint: Severe chest and back pain Onset of symptoms: Sudden  over a few hours  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for 10 years  inconsistently managed due to lack of regular medical check-ups.  2. History of smoking  approximately 20 cigarettes a day for 30 years. 3. Occasional binge drinking. 4. History of high cholesterol  infrequently managed with statins. 5. Cocaine use in his younger age. 6. No history of diabetes mellitus. 7. No previous surgical procedures. 8. No known drug allergies. 9. Family history of heart disease: father had myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  Demographic characterization: 1. Retired mechanic 2. Frequently experiences significant stress 3. Low-income with limited access to healthcare services 4. Has Medicare for health insurance coverage 5. Living alone after the death of his wife 2 years ago.  Problem Description:  The patient's presenting symptoms along with his demographic characteristics and past medical history suggest a possible aortic dissection. Age greater than 60 years  male sex  African-American race  hypertension  smoking  familial predisposition to cardiovascular diseases  high cholesterol  and history of cocaine use collectively contribute to Mr. Austin’s elevated risk for aortic dissection. The sudden onset of severe pain  often described as the worst-ever experienced  associated with the anterior chest or back  is typical for aortic dissection. The mechanism of dissection involves an intimal tear in the aorta  leading to the splitting of layers within the aortic wall and subsequent bleeding.  Further investigations and management will be guided based on these suspicions  with the aim to quickly establish a diagnosis and start treatment as aortic dissection is a potentially fatal condition requiring immediate attention.
Aortic Dissection,6,97,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old African American male patient presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as “tearing” and “ripping.” The pain was predominantly located in the anterior part of the chest  radiating to the back.   Demographic Characteristics: According to demographic data  men are more likely to develop aortic dissections than women  and the average age when dissection is diagnosed is approximately 60 years old. Also  African Americans are comparatively more likely to develop aortic dissections as compared to Caucasians.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled high blood pressure for about 15 years which is a significant risk factor  despite being prescribed antihypertensive medications. He is also a regular smoker since his teenage years and was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) 5 years ago. He underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) for his CAD. No evidence or history of genetic connective tissue disorder is recorded. Family history revealed his father had a sudden death in his late fifties due to some heart-related issues.   Clinical Presentation: On physical examination  a diastolic murmur was heard best at the left sternal border and the patient had a different blood pressure reading in each arm. Electrocardiography (ECG) did not show any sign of myocardial infarction. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an enlarged aortic root and ascending aorta.   These historical information  demographic characteristics  and current clinical presentation support the suspicion of aortic dissection. The immediate next step would be a definitive radiological investigation for the confirmation of diagnosis. Further information  such as the extent of the dissection  would dictate the course of therapy — whether the patient would need urgent surgery or could be managed initially with aggressive medical management to control blood pressure.
Aortic Dissection,6,98,Problem Representation:  Demographics- Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who has been a lifetime smoker but quit recently two years ago. He has a family history of aortic dissection with his father having experienced it at age 62. He is retired  lives alone and has been facing increasing stress due to financial instabilities. He consumes alcohol occasionally and is not physically active. He admits to a diet habit of high fat and high cholesterol foods.  Past Medical History- Patient X has a medical history in relevance to cardiovascular health issues. In particular  he has longstanding untreated hypertension since the last 10 years. He has also been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and hyperlipidemia. He previously experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) around six years ago. Due to his smoking habits  he also has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had a small abdominal aortic aneurysm  which was discovered during a routine medical check-up last year. Despite the recommendations  he has been inconsistent with his medications and has not followed up with his regular medical check-ups.   Implications- From the data available  it can be inferred that Patient X is at high-risk profile for aortic dissection due to his longstanding untreated hypertension  smoking  family history of aortic dissection  Marfan syndrome  TIA  and presence of aortic aneurysm. These factors predispose him to the risk of aortic wall stress and subsequent tear  leading to aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,7,1,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 67-year-old Caucasian female with a History of Hypertension.  Introduction: Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening condition understandably more prevalent in men than women. According to literature  patients who are Caucasian and over 60 years are more susceptible. This report highlights the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian female with a previous medical history of chronic hypertension  presenting with a type A aortic dissection.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  who lives independently and is a lifelong non-smoker. She has a documented medical history of chronic and poorly controlled hypertension for the past 15 years  which she attributes to noncompliance with her antihypertensive medications (Calcium channel blockers). She does not have a history of diabetes  stroke  or kidney disease. She has no known drug allergies.  She presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an abrupt onset of severe chest pain described as sharp and tearing  radiating to her back. The pain was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. She reported associated symptoms of shortness of breath  diaphoresis and nausea.   Physical examination showed an anxious patient with a blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg and pulse rate of 105 beats per minute  regular. The cardiopulmonary examination was significant for decreased breath sounds on the left side. Heart sounds were regular  no murmur was noted. Her neurologic exam was unremarkable.  Investigations: Diagnostic workup involved a chest X-ray which revealed a widened mediastinum. An electrocardiogram showed no signs of an acute coronary syndrome. Lab investigations  including cardiac enzymes  were within normal limits. Owing to the suspicion of an aortic dissection  a CT angiography was performed which confirmed a type A aortic dissection.  Management and Follow-Up: The diagnosis was regarded as a surgical emergency. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted immediately and she was taken to the operating room for emergent repair of the dissection  which was successful. Following the surgery  she was transferred to the ICU for postoperative care. She was started on beta-blockers to control her blood pressure. Her post-operative period was uneventful.  In the 6-month follow-up  she reported to be well with adequate blood pressure control. She was counseled on the importance of strict compliance to antihypertensive medications and was started on a low-sodium diet. Scheduled follow-up appointments were planned to monitor her blood pressure and overall health.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients with poorly controlled hypertension presenting with severe chest pain. Additionally  it emphasizes the critical role of patient education and compliance in the management of chronic illnesses like hypertension which  when poorly controlled  can lead to catastrophic outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,7,2,"Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged African American Female with Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report discusses a rare occurrence of acute aortic dissection in a 54-year-old African American female with a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension. This demographic not only provides a unique viewpoint due to its infrequency in current literature  but also emphasizes the importance of managing chronic health conditions to prevent emergencies like aortic dissection.  Case Presentation: A 54-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to her back. The patient described the pain as a """"tearing"""" sensation. Her past medical history was significant for uncontrolled hypertension and obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35. She was a non-smoker  consumed alcohol occasionally  and had no known drug allergies.  Prior to the hospital visit  the patient had multiple encounters related to her hypertension  and medication nonadherence was a repeated concern. Although she was prescribed a combination of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure control  the patient admitted that she did not take her medications regularly due to side effects and financial constraints.  Upon arrival  her blood pressure was significantly high (210/115 mm Hg). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no signs of ischemia. An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed due to the suspicion of aortic dissection  which confirmed a Stanford type B aortic dissection.  Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately started on labetalol to lower her blood pressure and was taken to the operating room for endovascular repair. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit post-operation. The patient was discharged home after 12 days  with improved hypertension control  and has remained asymptomatic on follow-up visits. She was also referred to a socially responsible medication program  to assist with the financial aspect of her treatment regimen.  Discussion: This case underscores the importance of patient adherence to chronic disease management and the severe consequences that can ensue when such diseases remain uncontrolled. Uncontrolled hypertension remains a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  making routine monitoring and treatment essential. Additionally  comprehensive patient care should consider the socioeconomic factors that may impact a patient's ability to adhere to a prescribed treatment plan.  Conclusion: While acute aortic dissection is rare  its potential to be lethal demands an expedient diagnosis. Thorough medical history  particularly concerning prolonged uncontrolled hypertension  is crucial for early detection and treatment. Attainment of blood pressure control and commitment to medication adherence also play substantial roles in preventing such medical emergencies."
Aortic Dissection,7,3,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 63-Year-Old Female  Identification and Demographics  The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden-onset severe chest pain. She is a retired school teacher  living in a suburban neighborhood with her husband. The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no known family history of heart diseases or genetic conditions.  Presenting Complaint  At the ED  she reported experiencing sudden-onset  severe chest pain radiating to her back  which she described as """"tearing"""" in nature. She had also briefly lost consciousness prior to arrival at the hospital.   Medical History  Apart from hypertension and diabetes  the patient has been generally healthy  with regular checkups. Diabetes and hypertension were diagnosed ten years prior  and the patient manages these with diet  oral medications  and regular exercise. She is a non-smoker and drinks socially.   Physical Examination and Investigations  Physical examination revealed the patient to be nervous with cold  sweaty skin. Blood pressure measurements showed a significant difference between the patient’s right arm (200/95 mm Hg) and left arm (160/90 mm Hg). On auscultation  a diastolic murmur was appreciated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) did not indicate any acute ischemic changes.  Chest X-ray displayed a widened mediastinum. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was subsequently performed revealing a type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the right common carotid artery and all the way down to the renal arteries.  Diagnosis and Treatment  The patient was diagnosed with a Type A aortic dissection. The severity of her condition and the involvement of ascendant aortic section necessitated immediate surgical intervention – an emergency surgical aortic repair was pursued. Her post-operative phase was stable  and the patient was discharged after a week with prescriptions for blood pressure and blood sugar control.  Follow-up  The patient has been advised to continue her blood pressure and blood sugar medications strictly  refrain from strenuous activities and heavy lifting. Regular follow-ups at the outpatient department have been scheduled for surveillance  managing the risk of future aortic complications  and ensuring optimal management of her hypertension and diabetes.  Discussion   The case demonstrates the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest pain even in the absence of typical risk factors such as male sex and smoking. Furthermore  it underscores the urgency of diagnosis and need for immediate surgical intervention to reduce the high rate of mortality associated with ascending aortic dissection.   Early recognition  high clinical suspicion  and prompt treatment can result in significantly improved outcomes in patients with aortic dissection. "
Aortic Dissection,7,4,Case Report: Emergent Diagnosis of Aortic Dissection in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Male  Patient Information:   Mr. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  residing in Salt Lake City  Utah  with no familial support. He is a retired civil engineer and lives alone.   Chief Complaint:  The patient arrived at the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that had started a few hours earlier  which he described as 'tearing' and radiating to his back.  History of Present Illness:   The patient's symptoms started abruptly while he was at home watching television. The pain was unrelieved by rest or usual medications and was accompanied by profuse sweating  extreme anxiety  and a feeling of impending doom.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. He is an ex-smoker (20 cigarettes/day for 30 years  quit 10 years ago) but does not consume alcohol. There is also a significant family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of myocardial infarction at age 64. He had no known drug allergies.   Physical Examination:  On arrival to ED  his blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg on right arm  145/90 mmHg on left arm. Heart rate was 110/min  respiratory rate 24/min  temperature 98.2F  and oxygen saturation was 96%. The examination revealed diaphoresis  pallor  and distress due to pain. Cardiac examination showed tachycardia without murmur. Chest and lung examination did not reveal any abnormality.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Electrocardiography (EKG) showed nonspecific ST changes  and initial troponin was not elevated. However  due to the nature of the chest pain  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was obtained which revealed a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta through the aortic arch and descending aorta into the iliac branches. Hemoglobin levels  kidney and liver function tests were all within normal limits.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to maintain his heart rate around 60 bpm  and his systolic blood pressure between 100-120 mmHg. He was subsequently transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department for an emergency surgical repair.  Outcome and Follow up:  A Bentall procedure was successfully performed to repair the aortic root  ascending aorta  and the aortic valve with a composite graft. Postoperative recovery was uneventful  and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 10 with prescriptions for antihypertensive therapy  and a comprehensive appointment for follow-up and interventions targeting lifestyle and secondary prevention.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection  although relatively rare  is a life-threatening condition often presenting with severe  abrupt onset chest pain. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in older patients with a history of hypertension and other risk factors  who present with excruciating chest pain.    This case also highlights the importance of early and aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control in patients with aortic dissection and emphasizes that definitive treatment  through open surgical or endovascular techniques  can be lifesaving. 
Aortic Dissection,7,5,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition  that predominantly affects older adults  characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aorta which allows blood to surge into the aorta outer layers. This case involves a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe telltale chest pain culminating in a diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Case Report: Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male from Midwest America with a previous medical history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack year smoking history. The patient is retired and lives with his wife  and he has three adult children. He had quit smoking ten years ago and took Lisinopril and Atorvastatin to manage his conditions  albeit inconsistent with his medication compliance.  Clinical Findings: The ambulance crew found the patient in severe distress outside his residence. He complained of an abrupt and severe tearing pain in his chest that radiated to his back. Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg  a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed a diaphoretic and grimacing man with asymmetrical upper extremity pulses.   Diagnostic Assessment: A 12-lead ECG performed en route revealed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. However  the combination of the patient's severe chest pain and hypertensive urgency raised concerns for aortic dissection. On arrival to the hospital  a CT angiogram of the chest was performed  which confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection originating from the ascending aorta and extending into the descending aorta  raising the case to critical and necessitating immediate surgery.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) and emergently taken to the operating theatre for surgical management involving an ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement while maintaining continuous medical treatment for his high blood pressure.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient's postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ventilation due to respiratory failure and transient acute kidney injury. After a 14-day hospitalization period including inpatient physical and occupational therapy  the patient was discharged to a sub-acute rehabilitation facility. During his 3 months follow-up appointment  the patient was found to be generally well and adherent to his medication regimen with controlled blood pressure.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition  diagnosis  and treatment of aortic dissection  based on characteristic symptoms and risk factors. Moreover  it underlines the critical role that adherence to chronic condition medication regimens  like antihypertensives  can play in preventing severe complications.
Aortic Dissection,7,6,"Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Female with Hypertension: A Case Report   Introduction: Aortic dissection  characterized by a tear in the aorta's inner layer  is a relatively infrequent but potentially fatal disease  significantly connected with hypertension. We present a case of a type A acute aortic dissection in a 65-year-old Caucasian female patient with a history of uncontrolled hypertension.  Case Presentation: The patient  a retired 65-year-old Caucasian woman  presented to the emergency department with acute severe chest pain. The pain onset was sudden and described as """"tearing"""" in nature  radiating to the back. She denied any association with effort or emotional stress. She had smoked approximately 20 cigarettes/day for 40 years and ceased 10 years ago. Her family history was significant for a brother who had a myocardial infarction at 70 years old. Her past medical history included long-standing hypertension  for which she had stopped taking prescribed medication due to perceived side effects. She had no known history of atherosclerotic vascular disease  diabetes mellitus  or connective tissue disorders.  Investigations: Initial evaluation revealed a blood pressure of 200/120 mm Hg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Her physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur and varying pulse volume in both arms. An immediate 12-lead electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of acute ischemia. Laboratory findings revealed elevated D-dimer  elevated serum creatinine  and modestly elevated troponin I levels. Chest radiography showed widening of the mediastinum. These preliminary findings raised the suspicion of aortic dissection and were later confirmed with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram which revealed a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the distal descending aorta.  Management and Outcome: She was promptly started on intravenous labetalol to lower her heart rate and blood pressure. She was referred to cardiothoracic surgery and underwent successful emergency ascending aortic replacement with a Dacron graft. Her postoperative course was uneventful  and she was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 15 with appropriate antihypertensive medication.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is frequently diagnosed too late  given the non-specific and variable presentation of the disease. Hypertension is the most common risk factor  as seen in this case. Regular monitoring of hypertensive patients  compliance with their medication  and early symptom recognition are key to improve prognosis and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with aortic dissection.   Learning Points: This case highlights the importance of multiple clinical aspects: the importance of a thorough history and physical  the diagnostic utility of CT in suspected aortic dissection patients  and the need for aggressive management (surgical and medical) in confirmed cases to prevent grave complications. The patient's long-standing  uncontrolled hypertension underscores the need for better monitoring and patient education about the critical importance of medication compliance in chronically ill patients."

Case presentation: The patient  an African American male aged 70 years  presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to his back  along with shortness of breath that he had been experiencing for nearly four hours. He is an active smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history and has a past medical history of hypertension that has been inadequately controlled for more than 15 years. Other than these  the patient has no history of surgical or other interventions.  Clinical findings: On physical examination in the ED  the patient was found to be tachycardic  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg. He had a diminished pulse in the left upper extremity compared to the right. Chest auscultation revealed distant heart sounds.  Diagnostic assessment: 12-lead ECG showed no signs of myocardial infarction. However  his D-dimer levels were significantly elevated. A chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum  prompting a CT angiogram of the chest  which confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection  extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.  Therapeutic interventions: Upon identification of the aortic dissection  the patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce his blood pressure and heart rate. He was emergently taken to the operating room  where he underwent successful aortic root replacement with a composite graft and was also started on chronic antihypertensive therapy.  Follow-up and outcomes: Postoperatively  the patient's recovery was uneventful. He was discharged home on the tenth postoperative day with close follow-up in cardiology and primary care clinics. On follow-up at 1 month post discharge  his blood pressure was well controlled  and he had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude for the care he received and verbally committed to quit smoking and to adhere strictly to his antihypertensive therapy.  Conclusion: This case highlights the role of prompt diagnosis and immediate therapeutic intervention in managing aortic dissection  especially in high-risk patients such as elderly  hypertensive  African American males with a history of smoking. This case also emphasizes the importance of stringent control of risk factors to prevent such life-threatening emergencies.

Aortic Dissection,7,9,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Hypertensive Patient  Introduction: Aortic dissection presents as an acute but potentially curable condition that warrants early diagnosis and immediate management. It occurs predominantly in men  and patients aged 60 to 80 years are frequently affected. The most common risk factors include hypertension  atherosclerosis  and genetic conditions.   Case Presentation:  Mr. X is a 72-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to his back. The patient rated the pain a 10 out of 10  describing it as tearing and ripping and worsening with movement.   Mr. X had a blood pressure of 190/86 mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur best heard over the right second intercostal space and a decreased upper extremity pulse. His medical history noted that he had been started on lisinopril five years ago but was non-compliant due to recurrent episodes of syncope.   Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) identified an intimal flap in the ascending aorta with flap extension into the aortic arch  consistent with a Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Electrocardiography showed no obvious myocardial ischemic changes. The troponin level was within the normal range.  Treatment: Mr. X was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to achieve a target heart rate below 60 beats/min and systolic blood pressure in the range of 100-120mmHg  and surgical consultation was urgently sought for. After discussing the substantial operative risks  the decision was made to proceed with an emergent aortic dissection repair.  Outcome and Follow-Up: Surgical correction of the aortic dissection was carried out successfully. Postoperatively  the patient developed transient renal insufficiency and required hemodialysis for two weeks. His recovery was otherwise uneventful  and he was discharged on post-operative day 28 with orders to resume lisinopril and start amlodipine for blood pressure control and instructed to follow up in the cardiac surgery clinic and nephrology clinic.  Conclusion: This case highlights the severity and urgency that an aortic dissection represents  particularly in high-risk groups such as older adults with hypertension. It underscores the need for immediate diagnosis and surgical correction and the crucial role of long-term hypertension management.

Aortic Dissection,7,10,Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old Male  Introduction  This is a case description of a 60-year-old Caucasian male presenting with the features of aortic dissection. The patient had a significant past medical history of hypertension  former tobacco use  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He lived in an urban setting  worked as a senior engineer  and had a sedentary lifestyle with little physical activity. He consumed moderate amounts of alcohol socially but was a long-term quitter from smoking.  Case Presentation  The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe tearing chest and back pain radiating to the abdomen. The pain was described as continuous and of increasing intensity over-proceeding hours. The patient also reported shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and palpitations. He had no history of trauma. The patient had a diagnosis of hypertension for the past 15 years  well-controlled on medication; he had quit smoking ten years back. Vital signs were significant for hypertension with a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and distressed by the pain. His breath sounds were reduced in the left side lower zone; other systemic examination findings were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-specific ST-T wave changes  but did not show evidence of ischemia or infarction.  Diagnostic Assessment  Laboratory investigations revealed slightly increased white blood cell count and elevated D-dimer levels. An emergency contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed an intimal flap with a false lumen consistent with type B aortic dissection  starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the renal arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was promptly initiated on pain control and IV anti-hypertensives to control the blood pressure and heart rate in order to limit the progression of the dissection. The vascular surgery department was consulted  and the patient was managed conservatively considering his type B dissection  stable vitals  and lack of complications such as malperfusion or rupture.  Follow-up and Outcomes  During his hospital stay  the patient's symptoms and blood pressure were well-controlled. Follow-up imaging showed stable aortic dissection with no evidence of expansion or complications. Antihypertensive therapy was planned for long-term maintenance  and the patient was educated about implications  risks  and signs of complications related to dissection.  Discussion  This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of acute severe chest/back pain  especially in patients with risk factors such as hypertension and tobacco abuse. A high index of suspicion and timely diagnosis can significantly impact the outcomes in this life-threatening emergency.  Patient's Perspective  The patient was satisfied with the management he received and was keen to alter his lifestyle to avoid any future cardiac events. Regular outpatient department follow-ups were planned to ensure successful long-term care.   Informed Consent  Informed consent was taken from the patient for anonymously using his case for academic discussion.
Aortic Dissection,7,11,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old African-American Male with Hypertension  Case Report:  Patient Information  A 65-year-old African-American male was brought to the emergency department complaining of severe chest and back pain. The pain was described as sudden in onset  severe  and tearing  radiating from the front to the back. The patient did not have a history of trauma  high-risk behaviors  or family history of aortic dissection or connective tissue diseases. He was a nonsmoker but had uncontrolled hypertension  resisting compliance with prescribed medications.  Clinical Findings  On clinical examination  the patient was agitated and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg and a pulse rate of 102 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a subtle diastolic murmur  and a differential pulse was observed. This includes unequal pulse strength in different vascular locations. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment  Electrocardiography did not reveal any evidence of acute ischemic changes. However  given the abrupt onset of the patient's severe pain  the decision was made to do computed tomography angiography (CTA).  CTA revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  extending to the aortic arch and descending aorta  consistent with Stanford Type A aortic dissection. No evidence suggested the involvement of the coronary or cerebral vessels.  Therapeutic Intervention  After the diagnosis  the patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to decrease heart rate and blood pressure and to relieve stress on the aortic wall. The patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical unit for immediate surgical intervention. Emergent open ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft was performed successfully.   Follow-Up and Outcomes  Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 on multiple antihypertensive medications  which he promised to comply with. He was referred to a hypertension clinic for regular monitoring. At the 6-month follow-up  the patient's blood pressure was well controlled and there was no complication related to the surgery.   Learning Points  This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with uncontrolled hypertension who present with acute chest pain. Early recognition and intervention are crucial  as untreated aortic dissection carries a high mortality rate. Furthermore  this case highlights the importance of medication adherence for hypertension management to prevent catastrophic consequences such as aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,7,12,Title: A Case Report: Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old African American Female   Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type 2. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) was recorded at 32 (classified as obese).   Clinical Findings: She presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to her back. She described the pain as a tearing or ripping sensation. The patient's blood pressure reading was significantly different in each arm  and a murmur was revealed upon physical examination.  Diagnostic Assessment: An EKG was conducted  which did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia. Blood tests detected elevated d-dimer levels  prompting further diagnostic investigation. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was then performed  clearly demonstrating a Stanford Type A aortic dissection (involvement of the ascending aorta).   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce heart rate and blood pressure  thereby minimizing the propagation of the dissection. Emergency cardiothoracic surgery was urgently arranged for surgical repair of the dissection.   Follow Up and Outcomes: The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient responded well to the surgical intervention. The patient was discharged after stabilization  with instructions for regular follow-up and the need for lifelong antihypertensive medication and monitoring.  Teaching Points: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency and should be considered in patients presenting with severe chest pain  particularly with a history of hypertension. Differences in blood pressure between limbs and widened mediastinum on chest X-ray are classic clinical clues. Immediate medical and often surgical intervention is necessary to decrease mortality.   This case report underscores the need for healthcare providers to be vigilant in recognizing the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection  especially in high-risk populations such as hypertensive  elderly  African American patients. Further  it highlights the importance of managing risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  and diabetes to prevent aortic dissection.   Lastly  although aortic dissection is often fatal  timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention  as demonstrated in this case  can result in successful outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,7,13,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 67-Year-Old African-American Male with Pre-existing Hypertension: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection refers to a serious condition characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  allowing blood to surge throughout the wall of the aorta  leading to severe pain and life-threatening complications. This case report presents a 67-year-old African-American male diagnosed with acute aortic dissection.   Case Presentation:  A 67-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain  radiating to the back  alongside symptoms of shortness of breath and profuse sweating. He appeared anxious and fearful. The patient's medical history included longstanding hypertension  borderline diabetes  and was a former smoker  having quit 10 years prior. He had no family history of aortic dissection or any connective tissue disorders.  Vital signs on presentation were blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg  pulse rate of 102 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Physical examination demonstrated a weakened pulse in the left arm compared to the right  and an early diastolic murmur was also appreciated.  Immediately  workup  including an electrocardiogram and bedside echocardiogram  were performed. Based on the findings from the echocardiogram  suspicion of aortic dissection was high. This was confirmed by a subsequent computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest  which revealed an ascending aortic dissection involving the arch but sparing the coronaries and descending aorta  classified as Stanford Type A.  The patient was immediately managed with intravenous labetalol to control his blood pressure  targeted at systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mm Hg. He was then promptly referred to cardiothoracic surgery for emergent repair of the aortic dissection.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is particularly common among males aged between 60 and 70. Hypertension  as in the case of this patient  is a well-documented risk factor for aortic dissection. This case underscores the fundamental steps for the early recognition and management of aortic dissection  a medical emergency where timely intervention can significantly impact the prognosis.  This patient's case was a typical presentation with sudden severe chest pain  a high blood pressure reading  and a clearly defined discrepancy in pulses. This case also underscores the need for a high index of suspicion in patients  especially those hypertensive  presenting with sudden chest or back pain.  Conclusion:  This case report highlights the importance of early recognition and management of aortic dissection. Clinicians should maintain a high clinical suspicion when encountering older patients with a history of hypertension presenting with severe  sudden-onset chest pain. Timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention can significantly reduce mortality related to this condition.

Aortic Dissection,7,15,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 68-year old Male with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report   Introduction:   Aortic dissection  a serious condition characterized by a tear in the aorta's inner layer  poses a significant risk to patient health often presenting with severe pain. Here  we report a case of aortic dissection in a 68-year old Caucasian male with a notable past medical history.  Case Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with presenting symptoms of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain initiated suddenly and was characterized as tearing and sharp. The patient had difficulty breathing  appeared pale  sweaty  and anxious.   Past Medical History:  Prior to this episode  the patient was generally healthy. Nonetheless  he had been diagnosed with moderate hypertension five years back  and was prescribed Lisinopril  which he had inconsistently complied with. He had a ten pack-years history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. No history of diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  illicit drug use  or family history of early coronary artery disease. He had no history of surgical procedures.   ED Examination:  On physical examination  his Blood Pressure (BP) readings were 170/110 mmHg and 160/95 mmHg on the right and left arms  respectively. Heart rate was 110 bpm  respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute  and SPO2 reading at 94% on room air. Cardiovascular examination palpated a bounding carotid  jugular veins were not distended  and heart sounds revealed tachycardia without a murmur. His chest was clear on auscultation. Abdominal and neurologic examination findings were normal.  Investigations:  Electrocardiogram (EKG) at presentation revealed a left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern but no features of ischemia or infarction. Emergency blood samples for full blood count  serum electrolytes  creatinine  glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)  and troponin levels were within normal range.   Due to high suspicion for aortic dissection  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the thorax was conducted. The CTA confirmed the clinical suspicion showing an ascending aortic dissection from the aortic root to the origins of the renal arteries (Stanford Type A).  Treatment:  The patient was immediately referred for emergent surgery. The patient underwent successful Bentall procedure with replacement of the aortic valve  aortic root  and ascending aorta using a composite graft.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Post-surgery  intense monitoring in the ICU was conducted for four days followed by general ward care. On subsequent follow-up visits  the patient reported substantial improvement in health status. Regular echocardiograms were planned for assessing the durability and function of the aortic valve replacement.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the critical role of early recognition and prompt intervention in managing aortic dissections  particularly among patients with a history of hypertension. It also underscores the importance of medication adherence in managing chronic diseases to prevent such catastrophic events. 
Aortic Dissection,7,16,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Woman with a History of Hyperlipidemia  Introduction:   Aortic dissection is defined as a tear in the inner lining of the aorta. It is a medical emergency that can potentially result in death if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Most cases are observed in men above 60 years with hypertension  although rare  it can also occur in women and younger individuals. We discuss the case of a middle-aged Caucasian woman with hyperlipidemia and a sudden presentation of aortic dissection.  Patient Information:  The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with a history of hyperlipidemia. She works as a regional manager in a sales company and has lived in Texas her entire life. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. The patient has two children  both of whom are developed and healthy. Recently  she has noticed an increase in her cholesterol levels in her yearly medical checkups. Despite these readings  she has not been taking any medications  nor has she ever had a prior episode of chest pain or any cardiovascular diseases.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back. She also reported feeling a tearing sensation in the chest. The blood pressure was notably higher on the right as compared to the left. Physical examination found equal peripheral pulses bilaterally  mild diaphoresis  and an anxious demeanor.  Diagnostic Assessment:  On suspicion of aortic dissection  she underwent Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) which confirmed a Type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries but sparing the coronaries. Her blood cholesterol levels were measured to be higher than the optimal values  indicating uncontrolled hyperlipidemia.   Therapeutic Intervention:  She was immediately taken to perform an emergency open surgical repair of the ascending aorta  aortic arch  and the proximal descending aorta with a synthetic graft. Post-surgery  her blood pressure and cholesterol were managed with a regiment of statins  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors. She was also advised to make lifestyle changes such as engaging in regular exercise  reducing sodium and cholesterol intake  and maintaining a healthy weight.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Follow-up after six months showed stabilized cholesterol levels with no recurrent chest pain. An ultrasound scan revealed no abnormal aortic dilation or dissection. Through self-commitment to lifestyle adjustment and medication adherence  the patient demonstrated an optimal recovery.  Conclusion:  Aortic dissections can sometimes be seen in individuals with no standard risk factors such as hypertension or age  as demonstrated in our patient. It is crucial to consider aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis in patients with chest pain regardless of age  sex  or traditional risk factors  especially when it occurs with typical radiations or associated symptoms. Due to its high mortality rate  timely diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection significantly contribute to patient outcomes.

His vitals upon arrival show a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg and a heart rate of 105 beats per minute.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented 20-year history of hypertension  which is inconsistantly controlled due to lapses in medication compliance. He is also a 40-pack-year smoker and has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  diagnosed six years prior. He has no history of bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disorders.  Upon arrival  the patient appeared pale and sweaty  describing the pain as sudden  sharp  and also radiating to his back between his shoulder blades. The patient's ECG showed no signs of acute myocardial infarction.  A CT scan with contrast was ordered  which provided a confirmation of Stanford Type B aortic dissection  originating from the left subclavian artery and ending just proximal to the celiac artery. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was also performed  revealing a dilated aortic root and root dissection.  The patient was promptly transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and started on intravenous labetalol to control his blood pressure with a goal systolic pressure of less than 120 mmHg. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted  and the patient was immediately prepared for open aortic repair. The patient's post-operative course was complicated by acute kidney injury but otherwise stable. He was discharged in stable condition to a sub-acute rehabilitation facility on post-op day 8  and a follow-up was scheduled in two weeks.  This case is an example of acute aortic dissection  a cardiovascular emergency which has been associated with hypertension  smoking  and other vascular risk factors. It underlines the importance of accurate diagnosis and immediate control of hypertension in these patients  as well as the role of early surgical intervention in preventing life-threatening complications.  Key Takeaways: Timely diagnosis and aggressive management of acute aortic dissection  particularly in patients with elevated risk factors such as hypertension  smoking and T2DM  can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive care should include immediate blood pressure control  rapid surgical consultation  and pertinent follow-up in the post-operative period. Lastly  this case also stresses the public health issue of medication noncompliance  especially in patients with critical conditions like hypertension.

Aortic Dissection,7,19,Title: Case Report: Acute Stanford A Type Aortic Dissection in a 52-year-old Caucasian Male  Introduction: Aortic dissection pertains to a serious condition where there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  leading to blood surging through the opening  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to dissect.   Case Presentation: A 52-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. X  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe  sudden onset anterior chest pain radiating to the back  which started approximately two hours prior to coming to the hospital. Associated symptoms included lightheadedness  diaphoresis  and shortness of breath. There were no associated symptoms of fever  cough  dysphagia  or trauma. Mr. X works as a construction supervisor and is a 30 pack-year smoker. His past medical history includes systemic hypertension and high cholesterol levels  controlled with daily administration of antihypertensive (Lisinopril) and statins (Atorvastatin).   Clinical Findings: In the ED  he was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg and an irregular heart rate of 90 bpm. Physical examination revealed a diaphoretic patient with a difference in blood pressure in both arms. A loud diastolic murmur was noted in the precordial area  and weak bilateral carotid and femoral pulses.  Investigations & Diagnosis: An immediate 12-lead ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and no evidence of acute ischemia or arrhythmia. Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed which showed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta consistent with Stanford Type A aortic dissection. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed the TEE findings.  Treatment: Following the diagnosis  the patient was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive treatment (Labetalol) to reduce blood pressure and alleviate the shear forces on the aortic wall. Once stable  he was taken to the operating room for emergency surgery where he underwent successful ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthetic valve.   Follow-ups & Outcomes: He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 10 on Furosemide  Warfarin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. He was counseled to quit smoking and given advice on appropriate diet and lifestyle changes. Regular outpatient clinic follow-up at 1 month  3 months  and subsequently every 6 months post-discharge was recommended for monitoring his condition.   Conclusion: This case underlines the critical importance of a high index of suspicion and early recognition of aortic dissection given the patient's history and associated risk factors. Timely diagnostic steps and immediate interventions can significantly increase the chance of survival and reduce the risk of devastating complications.

He has lived in the urban city of Baltimore  Maryland  all his life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  there is a higher prevalence of hypertension among African Americans in the US compared to other racial or ethnic groups.  Past Medical History: Patient had a history of chronic uncontrolled hypertension for more than a decade. He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 57 but was poorly compliant to prescribed medication and lifestyle modification. Documented blood pressure measurements consistently exceeded 140/90 mmHg. Additionally  he has had a history of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption until five years ago. The patient had no documented history of congenital heart diseases  Marfan syndrome  or any connective tissue disorders. He also reported no family history of cardiovascular disease or sudden deaths.   Case Description: Upon arrival  the patient appeared very uncomfortable and reported the pain to be a '10' on a scale of 0 to 10. He was sweating and had a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  blood pressure of 150/100 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).   An immediate ECG was performed and did not reveal any acute ischemic changes. Chest x-ray showed a widened mediastinum. With the clinical suspicion of aortic dissection  he was urgently taken for a CT angiogram which confirmed a type A aortic dissection beginning just above the aortic valve and extending into the right common carotid artery and down to the level of the renal arteries.   Outcome: After a thorough consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon  he underwent successful emergency surgery for replacement of the ascending aorta. Postoperative course was notable for transient acute kidney injury that resolved with intravenous fluid hydration. After an uneventful recovery  the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 10 with medications including beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce blood pressure and prevent future aortic dissection. Lifestyle changes and medication compliance were strongly emphasized at discharge.   Significance: This case encapsulates how uncontrolled chronic hypertension  a common and potentially modifiable risk factor  can lead to life-threatening conditions like aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,7,21,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Hypertensive African-American Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  We present the case of a 60 year-old African-American male diagnosed with an acute aortic dissection (AD). The patient  with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and habitual smoking  presented with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Case Presentation:  A 60-year-old African-American man with a 15-year history of untreated hypertension and a 20 pack-year smoking habit presented to the emergency department with a three-hour history of severe anterior chest pain that radiated to the back. The patient denied any other associated symptoms such as shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  and dizziness. The patient was a retired construction worker  lived with his wife  followed a high-sodium diet and had a family history of cardiovascular disease.  On initial assessment  the patient appeared distressed and anxious  with a BP of 190/110mmHg and a heart rate of 108 bpm. The physical examination was significant for an early diastolic murmur appreciated over the right second intercostal space. There was no evidence of neurological deficit  acute limb ischemia  or pulsus paradoxus. His EKG showed only left ventricular hypertrophy.  Given the presented symptoms  clinical suspicion of an aortic dissection was high. Hence  a CT angiogram was ordered which confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the brachiocephalic trunk  left common carotid and left subclavian arteries.  Emergency surgical consultation was sought  and the patient underwent an emergent ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft. His postoperative course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury that resolved with supportive management. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 15 on dual anti-hypertensive therapy.  Discussion:  This case report highlights the risk factors for aortic dissection including untreated hypertension  smoking  and African-American ethnicity. It also underscores the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in acute aortic dissection that often presents with nonspecific symptoms making diagnosis challenging.  Majority of aortic dissections occur in men  aged 60-70 years  with hypertension being a significant risk factor. African American men are also reported to have higher rates compared to other ethnicities. Therefore  this case report demonstrates an accurate demographic representation as found in literature. Given the associated morbidity and mortality  early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention remain crucial to a successful outcome in aortic dissection.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of severe chest or back pain  especially amongst middle-aged African-American men with hypertension. Prompt diagnosis and management in such cases can significantly contribute towards reducing morbidity and mortality.
Aortic Dissection,7,22,Title: Aortic Dissection: A Sudden and Severe Condition Needing Immediate Medical Attention - A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which the inner layer of the aorta  the large blood vessel branching off the heart  tears. It is often characterized by severe chest pain and is considered a medical emergency. Middle-aged to older adults  specifically men  have the highest incidence. We report a case of a 60-year-old African-American man presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute aortic dissection.  Case Presentation:  Mr. S  a 60-year-old African-American male  with a past history of hypertension  borderline diabetes  and 40 pack-year smoking behavior  presented to the Emergency Department with acute  severe chest pain radiating to the back. He is a skilled worker and reported occasional alcohol consumption.  His chest pain was tearing in character  and there were no particular aggravating or relieving factors. There was no history of trauma. His blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg  pulse rate 100/minute  and other vitals were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram did not show any acute ischemic changes.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a 20-year history of hypertension which is mostly controlled with Amlodipine and Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with prediabetes 5 years ago  which has been managed with lifestyle changes and Metformin. The patient also has a longstanding smoking history.  Upon examination  the patient had a discrepancy in blood pressure readings in both arms. With the patient's history of uncontrolled hypertension  prediabetes  a significant smoking history  and his current symptoms  a probable diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.  Investigation:  A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered  which showed a Stanford type A aortic dissection from the aortic root extending into the ascending aorta. No branch vessel involvement was seen.  Treatment and Follow-Up:  The patient was immediately administered intravenous antihypertensives to lower blood pressure and prevent further tearing. He was prepared for emergency surgery to repair the dissected aorta which included a successful replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve.  Post-operative recovery was uneventful  and his blood pressure was maintained around 130/80 mm of Hg. The patient was discharged with recommendations for complete cessation of smoking  regular blood pressure monitoring  and strict blood glucose control. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor his condition.  This case highlights the rapid diagnosis and management of an acute aortic dissection in an individual with major risk factors  including hypertension  prediabetes  and smoking.  Conclusion:  High suspicion of aortic dissection in patients presenting with unexplained severe chest or abdominal pain  especially in those with established risk factors  is crucial for a timely and accurate diagnosis. Early diagnosis  controlling blood pressure  and prompt surgical intervention can remarkably reduce mortality and morbidity associated with this condition.

Past Medical History: Mr. X’s significant past medical history included hypertension  CAD  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. His medication regimen included a beta-blocker  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  aspirin  nitroglycerin  metformin  and atorvastatin.   IV. Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: On physical examination  Mr. X was anxious  diaphoretic with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 20 per minute  and had a harsh systolic murmur. Neurological examination and chest X-ray were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram showed no new ST or T wave changes. Due to high suspicion of aortic dissection  he underwent an urgent CT aortogram which showed an Intimal flap in the ascending aorta confirming the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  V. Patient Management and Prognosis: The patient was promptly started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate. An emergent cardiothoracic surgery consult was placed. Given the patient's high risk of rupture  he underwent emergent surgical repair of the aortic dissection. His postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation but improved with medical management. He was discharged home on day 15 post-surgery  on strict blood pressure and diabetes control with close follow up outpatient appointments planned.  VI. Discussion: Mr. X's case demonstrates the classic presentation of an acute Type A aortic dissection  emphasizing the importance of suspicion and timely intervention in high-risk patients. His history of hypertension  CAD  and age made him particularly susceptible to aortic dissection. His subsequent postoperative course and management also highlight the potential complications and the need for intensive care in these patients.   VII. Conclusion: This case report emphasizes the importance of early recognition and management of aortic dissection in high-risk groups  such as African-American males with a history of hypertension and CAD. It also highlights the critical role of secondary preventive measures  like tight blood pressure and blood glucose control  to avoid such catastrophic events."
Aortic Dissection,7,25,Title: A Case Report of a 68-Year-Old Male with Type B Aortic Dissection  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a critical  potentially life-threatening vascular pathology widely considered as a cardiovascular emergency. The rapid recognition of the clinical manifestations followed by urgent therapeutic interventions can make the difference between life and death.  Patient Information:  Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired mechanic  with a known history of long-term uncontrolled hypertension and tobacco smoking for the last 25 years; two significant risk factors for aortic dissection.   Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as 'tearing' in nature  radiating to his back. He was also experiencing shortness of breath  fatigue and was profusely sweating. Upon evaluation  his blood pressure was markedly high (190/110 mm Hg) and heart rate was elevated (110 bpm).  Diagnostic Evaluation: The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy without any ST-segment deviation or T-wave inversion  often seen in myocardial infarction. Immediately  a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was ordered  which revealed an intimal flap in the descending thoracic aorta indicative of Type B aortic dissection  extending to the renal arteries without any involvement of the ascending aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with immediate initiation of beta-blockers to control his hypertension and heart rate. Given the Type B aortic dissection  an initial conservative management approach with aggressive blood pressure lowering and heart rate control was adopted. Regular monitoring of the patient's vital signs  neurological status  and renal function was performed.  Follow-Up: The patient's chest pain significantly improved with control of blood pressure. Serial CT scans were performed to monitor progression of the dissection  and no indication for surgical intervention was needed. He was discharged with instructions for strict blood pressure control  cessation of smoking  regular follow-up and immediate return to the ED if his chest pain reoccurred or worsened.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and strategic management of aortic dissection. It underscores the need for aggressive risk factor control  especially hypertension  in patients at risk for this potentially fatal condition.

He further reported feeling unwell for several weeks with progressive fatigue and intermittent  non-specific thoracic discomfort.  3. Past Medical History:  Mr. Z had been diagnosed with systemic hypertension since his late 30s  which was poorly controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. He had undergone a hernia repair surgery in his 40s. Moreover  he has a significant genetic history - his father had an unexpected death in his early 60s from a suspected myocardial infarction.   4. Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient showed mild diaphoresis with blood pressure recorded at 220/110 mmHg while his pulse rate was 70 beats per minute. No abnormalities were detected on chest examination and his heart sounds were normal. Auscultation revealed no bruits over the carotid artery and his peripheral pulses were symmetrical.   5. Diagnostic Assessment:  Based on the clinical presentation  aortic dissection was strongly suspected. An emergency computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed  confirming a diagnosis of Type B aortic dissection starting immediately distal to the left subclavian artery  and propagated for the length of the descending thoracoabdominal aorta. Laboratory tests displayed elevated D-dimers.  6. Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-Up:  The patient was immediately administered intravenously with beta-blockers and nitroprusside to control his blood pressure. Following these interventions  his blood pressure normalized and pain significantly decreased. He was admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery department and managed conservatively with optimal medical therapy  as recommended for uncomplicated type B aortic dissections.   7. Outcome and Prognosis: Mr. Z survived the acute event and his follow-up imaging 3 months later showed stable dissection without any signs of aneurysmal dilatation or rupture. He was discharged with regular outpatient follow-up instructions.  8. Lessons Learned: This case raises awareness about aortic dissection  especially in hypertensive male smokers with non-specific thoracic discomfort. Prompt diagnosis using CTA and immediate pharmacologic intervention are pivotal in managing such life-threatening conditions.  9. Patient Consent: Written informed patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.  10. Confidentiality: Patient confidentiality was maintained by omitting identifying information.
Aortic Dissection,7,27,Title: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Adult: A Case Report  Introduction:   Aortic dissection is a medical emergency characterized by the separation of the layers of the aortic wall  causing blood to flow in between them. This disease often manifests in hypertensive patients  taking a higher toll on males and older individuals.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X is a 58-year-old Caucasian male with a history of longstanding hypertension who presented to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back. He described it as a sharp  tearing sensation. He also reported weakness in his lower extremities and shortness of breath.  The patient is a retired police officer and a smoker for the past 30 years. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His family history reveals that his father died of a stroke at the age of 65  and his mother had hypertension and passed away from heart disease.  On examination  the patient appeared pale and had profuse sweating. His blood pressure at presentation was 210/120 mmHg  and his heart rate was 110 bpm. He had a diastolic murmur  and his pulses were diminished in his lower extremities.  Investigations:  Electrocardiogram revealed no signs of myocardial ischemia. Laboratory tests showed a slightly elevated D-dimer. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening  suggestive of aortic dissection. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta  descending thoracic aorta  and the arch (Type A dissection).  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensives to manage his blood pressure. Emergency surgery was performed successfully to repair the dissected aorta. The postoperative period was uneventful  and the patient was discharged on oral antihypertensives. Regular follow-ups were scheduled  and the patient was strongly advised to stop smoking  control his blood pressure  and regularly monitor his cardiovascular health.  Discussion:  This case underscores the critical nature of early diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection. It is a condition that primarily affects males and those over 50 years old. The sudden onset of severe chest or back pain  often described as tearing or ripping  accompanied by other symptoms such as fainting  shortness of breath  or weakness or paralysis of one side of the body  requires immediate medical attention.   As evidenced by this case  early detection and immediate medical intervention can lead to effective management and positive outcomes for patients. Timely surgery  followed by adequate management of blood pressure and lifestyle modifications  are crucial in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,7,28,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 62-Year-Old Caucasian Male with Hypertension—A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection (AD) is a critical condition affecting the aorta and often has an unanticipated onset. It predominantly affects males over the age of 60  and hypertension is the most common risk factor. This case report details a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension diagnosed with acute aortic dissection.   Patient Information:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient was a long-term smoker (up to 20 cigarettes per day for 40 years)  had a medical history of hypertension  and reported no previous cardiovascular symptoms. He was non-diabetic and did not report symptomatic cardiovascular disease or connective tissue disorder in his family history.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination indicated elevated heart rate (102 beats/min)  decreased blood pressure in the right arm compared to the left (right: 98/62 mmHg  left: 146/88 mmHg) and a faint diastolic murmur over the aortic area. Neurological examination showed clear cognition and no signs of focal neurologic defects  which excluded acute stroke symptoms.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood tests showed slightly raised D-dimer levels (0.92 mg/L)  which can be an indicator for AD. An immediate Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford Type A AD  with the intimal tear located in ascending aorta extending to the aortic arch and descending aorta.   Therapeutic Interventions:  The patient was emergently referred to cardiac surgery. An urgent operation on the ascending aorta was performed (Bentall procedure) and postoperative course was managed with antihypertensive therapy to maintain systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg.   Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient had an uneventful recovery post-operation. The patient showed good progress at a six-month follow-up  with CTA confirming the absence of AD progression. He was counseled about the importance of maintaining strict blood pressure control and ceasing smoking. He also provided referrals to smoking cessation services and nutritionist for lifestyle modification.  Conclusion:  This case emphasized the critical role of early diagnosis and interventional treatment in patients with Stanford Type A AD. Proper risk factor management  especially hypertension and smoking cessation  is crucial to prevent such severe cardiac events.   Note: This case report serves as an educational tool and provides insight into the diagnostic and treatment strategies  as well as the continuum of care for AD management. As always  patient privacy and consent should be followed rigorously in drafting case reports.
Aortic Dissection,7,29,"Title: Sudden Severe Chest Pain in an Elderly Patient: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection   Patient Information: J.D. is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe chest pain which started approximately 3 hours prior.  History of Present Illness: J.D. described his chest pain as feeling """"like a tearing sensation"""" in the middle of his chest  which then radiated to his back. The onset was sudden  occurred at rest  and did not diminish with any position. He also reported feeling dizzy and short of breath but denied any other symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  or sweating.   Past Medical History: J.D. had a significant history of hypertension  which had been controlled with daily medication (Losartan 100mg daily) for 15 years. He also had a history of hypercholesterolemia  for which he took Atorvastatin 40mg daily. J.D. was a non-smoker and rarely consumed alcohol. He had no known drug allergies. No previous history of chest pain or cardiovascular disease had been reported in his family.  Physical Examination: On examination  J.D. appeared anxious with a BP of 175/105 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  temperature of 98.6°F and oxygen saturation of 93%. His chest examination revealed a diastolic murmur  heard best at the left second intercostal space.  Diagnostic Assessment: Immediate ECG showed no signs of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Further diagnostic investigation using a computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending distally to the abdominal aorta  indicating Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Treatment: An emergency thoracic surgery consultation was obtained  and J.D. was urgently taken to the operating theatre for open surgical repair of his dissecting aorta.  Outcome and Follow-up: J.D. survived the procedure and transferred to intensive care for post-operative management which included maintenance of blood pressure with anti-hypertensive medication and pain management. Postoperative echocardiography showed that the diameter of the proximal aorta returned to normal with no leak of the aortic valve present.   Patient was later discharged and has attended several follow-up appointments without complication and with significantly lower blood pressure (130/85 mmHg).  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need for high clinical suspicion and prompt investigation for aortic dissection in patients  especially elderly ones with hypertension  presenting with acute  severe chest pain.   Take-Home Message:  Despite being a relatively rare condition  misdiagnosis can lead to high mortality rates. Aortic dissection must hence be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe chest pain. Early detection and immediate surgical intervention can significantly enhance survival rates."
Aortic Dissection,7,30,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 60-Year-Old Male with a History of Hypertension  Introduction: Aortic dissection  a serious and sometimes fatal cardiovascular condition  affects two to three individuals per 100 000 every year. This condition predominantly affects men between the ages of 60 and 80 years.  Case Presentation: A 60-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with severe  sudden-onset chest pain that radiated to his back. The patient has a clinical history of chronic hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use. He does not have a personal or family history of connective tissue disorders. His medications include amlodipine and simvastatin.   Examination: Upon presentation  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 200/130mmHg  heart rate regular at 110/min  respiratory rate at 18/min  and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Physical examination revealed a grade II/VI decrescendo diastolic murmur on the left sternal border and weakened peripheral pulses. There were no neurological deficits.  Investigation: The ECG demonstrated non-specific changes. Troponin-I levels were within normal limits  ruling out myocardial infarction. A D-dimer test was performed given the high suspicion for aortic dissection  which was significantly elevated. Subsequently  a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was performed confirming the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta.  Management: The patient was immediately started on intravenous (IV) beta-blockers and sodium nitroprusside to control his blood pressure and heart rate. After stabilization  the patient was transferred to a higher center for emergency cardiothoracic surgery. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10. He was prescribed amlodipine  metoprolol  and atorvastatin. The patient was advised to quit smoking and maintain regular follow-ups.  Discussion: Hypertension is the most significant risk factor for aortic dissection  present in up to 75% of cases. Older age  primarily amongst males  tobacco use  and atherosclerosis  all of which were evident in our patient  are also notable factors. In cases  such as the one described  where the patient presents with classic symptoms and risk factors  early diagnosis and immediate surgical treatment are crucial for improving chances of survival.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion in diagnosing aortic dissection particularly in high-risk individuals. Early recognition  prompt control of blood pressure  and timely surgical treatment are vital for favorable outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,7,31,Title: Case Report: Presentation and Management of Aortic Dissection in a 58-year-old Hispanic Male Patient.  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the inner layer of the aortic wall tears  causing blood to surge into the wall of the aorta. Though relatively uncommon  it is frequently lethal  necessitating prompt diagnosis and management.  Case Report: Patient Information: A 58-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden  severe  tearing chest pain that had started 6 hours prior. The patient was a smoker and had a case history of hypertension  having irregular blood pressure control despite anti-hypertensive medication. Albiet overweight (BMI 27)  the patient had no reported other medical conditions  notably no past histories of connective tissue disease  family history of aortic disease  or history of illicit drug use often associated with aortic dissection.  Clinical Findings: Initial assessment revealed a pale  sweaty man in obvious distress. He was conscious  confused  and oriented to time  place and person. His blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg in the right arm and 160/90 mmHg in his left arm  with a regular pulse of 100 bmp. Physical examinations showed interscapular pain on palpation. Heart sounds were normal and there were no audible murmurs.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation of hypertension and severe chest pain  an emergency CT angiography was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  Stanford Type A. The tear originated from the ascending aorta propagated to the descending aorta.  Intervention and Outcome: The patient was sent for emergency open-heart surgery  where a successful repair of the ascending aortic dissection was performed by replacing the damaged section with a prosthetic graft. After surgery  he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was stable and responded well to conservative management. He was extubated on the following day of the surgery and slowly returned to normal vitals. Post-operative echocardiography showed no apparent aortic insufficiency or pericardial effusion.  The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 with a prescription for lifelong antihypertensive therapy  tailored lifestyle modification advice  follow-up appointments  and the recommendation of regular cardiac imaging surveillance.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining suspicion of aortic dissection in hypertensive patients presenting with sudden  severe  tearing chest pain  even without other classic findings. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention remain paramount to a successful outcome in these often catastrophic presentations.  Conclusion: While this case had a successful outcome through early recognition and intervention  aortic dissection remains a high-mortality condition. Regular follow-ups  compliance with hypertensive therapy  and lifestyle modification are deemed necessary for this patient to diminish the risk of future cardiac complications. Hence  it underscores the significant role of primary health providers in recognizing early-warning symptoms and promptly referring patients to dedicated emergency facilities.
Aortic Dissection,7,32,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. S is a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe chest pain. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. They have three grown children. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol use.  Chief Complaint:  The patient has been suffering from intense chest pain radiating to his back for the last few hours. He described the pain as a 'tearing' sensation  unlike anything he had previously experienced.  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension for which he has been prescribed beta-blockers. He has controlled type 2 diabetes and had an MI 5 years ago. His surgical history is relevant for a hernia repair 10 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 73  while the patient's mother suffered from hypertension and passed away at the age of 80 due to stroke. One of his brothers has type 2 diabetes and primary hypertension.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  Mr. S appeared uncomfortable. His blood pressure was found to be significantly different between his arms  which is a potential sign of aortic dissection. His heart sounds were regular but brisk. No murmurs or bruits were appreciated on auscultation. His breath sounds were clear bilaterally.  Investigations:  Initial ECG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia  but his troponin levels were slightly elevated. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography raised suspicion of aortic dissection. Further validation by computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a Type A aortic dissection extending from just above the sinotubular junction down into the abdominal aorta.  Treatment and Outcome:  Due to the type and location of the dissection  emergent surgical intervention was recommended. Mr. S underwent successful aortic root replacement and ascending hemiarch repair surgery a few hours following diagnosis. During the post-operation period  the patient's blood pressure was strictly controlled to prevent propagation of the dissection. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on post-operative day ten.  Discussion:  The case illustrates a common presentation of aortic dissection  a potentially fatal condition that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Mr. S's advanced age  male gender  African-American race  and history of hypertension and prior cardiovascular disease place him at an increased risk for this condition. His diagnosis was primarily delayed due to his atypical presentation but was validated promptly using imaging  emphasizing the importance of clinical vigilance and high suspicion in these patients. This case also highlights the importance of controlling risk factors to prevent aortic dissection  in particular  strict blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.  Follow Up:  At 6-month follow-up  the patient was doing well with no recurrence of chest or back pain and blood pressure within the normal range. He was counseled regarding the importance of regular follow-ups and a healthy lifestyle  with emphasis on consistent blood pressure control and optimal glycemic control to manage his risks.
Aortic Dissection,7,33,Title: A Case Report on Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Male Patient  Abstract: We report a case of a 65-year-old African American male who was diagnosed with aortic dissection after presenting with acute chest pain. The case evaluation gives light to the presentation  diagnosis  and management of aortic dissection in a senior patient with a complex medical history including hypertension and diabetes.  Case Presentation:  Mr. A  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain started approximately 6 hours prior to his ED visit. The patient has a known medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. There was no significant family history of cardiovascular disease.  On examination  he was conscious  anxious  and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg in his right arm  and 160/95 mmHg in his left arm. Pulse rate was 104 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 22 per minute. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed a regular rhythm and no murmur.  An electrocardiogram was done immediately  which showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated D-dimer level. Due to the differential blood pressures and elevated D-dimer levels  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of an ascending aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the descending thoracic aorta.  Mr. A was managed aggressively in the ED with intravenous antihypertensives to control his blood pressure. Emergent bedside consults with cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology were obtained. He underwent emergent surgical repair of the aortic dissection.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that lies hidden behind common symptoms such as chest pain. It requires a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis and effective management. It is more commonly seen in individuals with hypertension  as in our patient  the prevalence is higher in men and increases with age.   As reported in literature  African Americans are disproportionately impacted by aortic dissection  which matches our case report. The patient had a significant past medical history and presented with classic symptoms of aortic dissection. His hypertension  the presence of diabetes  and being African American  possibly contributed as risk factors.  The diagnosis was confirmed with a CTA and immediate intervention was performed  which is the standard care for aortic dissections. His outcome emphasizes the necessity for early intervention in such high-mortality conditions.  Conclusion:  This case report underlines the importance of understanding that aortic dissection can mimic other pathologies and it demands a vigilant approach. Prompt recognition of the condition and appropriate referral for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment is likely to improve survival rates.

Aortic Dissection,7,34,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 55-year-old Hypertensive African American Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection  a potentially fatal medical condition marked by a tear in the aorta's wall  presents a significant risk to hypertensive individuals. Health disparities have resulted in underrepresentation of African Americans in cardiovascular disease literature  despite experiencing high rates of cardiovascular disease  including hypertension. This case report presents an underrepresented demographic  a middle-aged African American male  to emphasize the importance of early detection and management.  Patient Information:  Mr. C  a 55-year-old African American male patient  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his back  exacerbated on physical exertion. He has a past medical history notable for hypertension  which was poorly controlled despite medication. The patient's non-pharmacological management was erratic due to socioeconomic challenges  including unstable housing and limited access to healthful food options.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious  diaphoretic  and pale. Vital signs recorded were: blood pressure 190/110mmHg  heart rate 112 bpm  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and temperature 37.2°C. His cardiovascular exam revealed an early diastolic murmur  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. There was also an inconsistency in pulse character between the upper and lower limbs.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent computerized tomography angiography (CTA) was arranged due to acute onset severe chest pain with features suggestive of aortic dissection  which revealed a Stanford Type A dissection with involvement of the ascending aorta. Laboratory results indicated mildly elevated cardiac enzymes and a D-Dimer level of 2500 ng/ml.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately treated with intense pain relief using morphine and nitroprusside initiated to reduce blood pressure and to decrease the sheer stress on the aortic wall. After stabilization  he was rushed for an emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest  which was successful.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was followed up in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Clinic after discharge. He started an antihypertensive medication and was advised lifestyle modifications  such as adopting a low-salt  low-fat diet  along with consistent medication use. He was also offered social support to better manage his hypertension and generally improve his lifestyle.  Conclusions:  This case report underscores the importance of recognizing aortic dissection promptly in hypertensive patients and provides insight into this condition's presentation among African American males. The follow-up care emphasizes a comprehensive approach  including surgical intervention  pharmacological control of blood pressure  lifestyle modifications  and social supports  in effective aortic dissection management.  Patient Perspective:  Mr. C reported that his experiences had increased his awareness of managing his health conditions. He was eager to improve his health and engage more actively with support services to maintain his health and quality of life.
Aortic Dissection,7,35,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old African American Male with a History of Hypertension  Case Report:  Introduction:  Aortic dissection  a relatively rare cardiovascular condition  instigates a tear in the inner layer of the aorta. It is more prevalent in males and individuals over the age of 60  with hypertension being a major risk factor. This event primarily affects older Caucasian males  but the severity and lethality is often greater in African Americans.  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for chronic  poorly controlled hypertension and smoking. Despite medication  his blood pressure has consistently stayed above 145/95 mm Hg. He has not had any previous surgeries and does not have any known allergies. He retired as an engineer  is widowed  and lives with his adult daughter. The patient is a current smoker with a 45-year pack history.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back  neck  and jaw  associated with palpitations  dyspnea  and diaphoresis beginning an hour prior to arrival. No noted loss of consciousness  numbness  or bladder or bowel incontinence.   On examination  he appeared diaphoretic and distressed. Vital signs on examination showed a blood pressure of 180/110 mm Hg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Pulses were symmetrical and full in all extremities.   Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. Lab tests were remarkable for elevated troponin. Computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was obtained  which revealed a Stanford Type A aortic dissection beginning from aortic root  extending to the arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was promptly started on intravenous Esmolol for heart rate and blood pressure management. Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted emergently and the patient was taken to the operating room for an emergent Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch Replacement surgery. The procedure was performed without complications  and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care for post-operative management.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  The patient was kept under close monitoring in the ICU. Post-operatively  his blood pressures were well controlled with medication. He was discharged on post-operative day 10  after ensuring stable cardiovascular status on oral beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy.   Patient was advised to have close follow ups with Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery for monitoring. Smoking cessation was greatly emphasized  and counseling for the same was arranged. He was also referred to the Hypertension Clinic for better control of his blood pressure  to avert future cardiovascular events.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and surgical intervention in Acute Type A aortic dissection  especially in high-risk groups like hypertensive African American males.       
Aortic Dissection,7,36,Title: Spontaneous Ascending Aortic Dissection in a Young Asian Male with No Previous Medical History – An Unusual Presentation   Introduction:  The true incidence of aortic dissection (AD) is challenging to estimate due to its diverse presentations and the unfortunate fact that it can be swiftly fatal. However  it’s estimated to range between 2.6-3.5 cases per 100 000 persons-years.  Patient Information: A 26-year-old Asian male  fit and well  an accomplished athlete with no previous illnesses or medical conditions  presented to the hospital. He is an occasional smoker and his family history was unremarkable with no history of connective tissue disease or early cardiac disease.   Clinical Findings: The patient was presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiated to his back  mimicking myocardial infarction (heart attack). The pain was described as stabbing and worsening with each heartbeat. He was also experiencing severe shortness of breath and was noticeably anxious and diaphoretic.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial EKG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. Lab tests indicated a slight elevation in his troponin levels. A CT angiogram was conducted and showed an intimal flap within the thoracic aorta  diagnostic for AD. The Stanford Classification was type A as the dissection involved the ascending aorta. No other organ damage or secondary issues were identified  suggesting he arrived before a catastrophic event could occur.   Therapeutic Intervention:  He was started on beta-blockers and immediately referred for emergency cardiothoracic surgery - an ascending aorta replacement with a Dacron graft. The operation  although risky  was successful. Post-operative echocardiography confirmed the absence of AD and no aortic regurgitation.   Follow-up and outcomes:  Postoperatively  the patient's recovery was without complications. Regular follow-up with CT scans was recommended. The patient was also referred to a genetic counselor due to the high index of suspicion for an underlying connective tissue disease despite the unremarkable family history.   Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude for the fast diagnosis and immediate intervention and was compliant with his follow-up appointments and lifestyle changes.   Discussion: Though aortic dissection is relatively common  this case is of interest due to the patient’s young age  lack of medical history and family history  and Asian ethnicity where the incidence is considered to be lower compared to Caucasians. However  his smoking might have been a contributing risk factor. An underlying genetic cause could not be ruled out  hence the need for genetic counselling.   Conclusions:  This report emphasizes the significance of considering AD in the differential diagnosis in young patients presenting with severe chest pain  regardless of risk factors.
Aortic Dissection,7,37,Title: A Case Report of Standford Type B Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Caucasian Male with a History of Hypertension and Smoking  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a relatively uncommon but often life-threatening condition in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the aorta. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered in managing this patient and underscores the role of relevant risk factors in the setting of aortic dissection.  Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe upper-back pain. The pain commenced while the patient was sitting at home  and was continuous  sharp in nature  and radiated to the chest. The patient had no history of trauma or heavy lifting prior to the onset of pain. He had a 20-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  a 45-pack year smoking history and a daily alcohol intake of about 30 grams. He was on medication for hypertension  but compliance was poor. The patient’s father had suffered an aortic dissection at 67.  Upon presentation  the patient’s blood pressure was significantly elevated  with a higher reading in the right arm than in the left. His heart rate was 90 beats per minute  and his physical examination was otherwise unremarkable  with clear lungs on auscultation and a regular heart rhythm with no murmur or Fremitus. Lab results demonstrated an elevated D-dimer level  indicative of a possible clotting disorder. Otherwise  blood work  including complete blood count  chemistry  and coagulation studies  were within normal limits.  Considering the medical history and presenting symptoms  a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed  which revealed a Standford type B aortic dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending into the abdominal aorta.   Treatment: Given that the patient’s dissection was Stanford classification type B  the primary treatment consisted of aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control  with medications to quickly lower his high blood pressure and prevent further dissection. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and medical management.   Outcome and Follow-up: He responded well to the treatment and his blood pressure was successfully controlled within the following days. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks and referred to a smoking cessation program and cardiologist for optimal hypertension control. Further imaging studies will be conducted continuously to keep a close check on the aortic dissection and monitor any potential complications.   Discussion: This case underscores the significance of identifying and managing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and smoking in preventing aortic dissection. Attention to out-of-range vitals  physical examination  and relevant past medical history may raise suspicion for this potentially catastrophic diagnosis in an appropriate clinical setting.
Aortic Dissection,7,38,"Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 58-year-old Caucasian Male  Patient Information:   The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian man  married with two children. He is employed as a truck driver and has a history of smoking and alcoholism. The patient is overweight and leads a sedentary lifestyle. His family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at 62  and his mother suffers from high blood pressure.  Presenting Issue:   The patient reported severe chest pain radiating to the back  along with shortness of breath and vomiting. He described the pain as a severe """"tearing"""" sensation. The sudden onset and severity of the pain had been a new experience for him  thus brought to Emergency Department.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  his blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  and his pulse was 120 beats per minute. There was no significant difference in blood pressure between the two arms. Pulses in all extremities were palpable and symmetrical. He appeared pale  with diaphoresis. Auscultation revealed no heart murmurs. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed slight left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of myocardial infarction.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  The differential diagnosis was acute aortic dissection  myocardial infarction  and pulmonary embolism. Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history  an urgent CT scan of the chest was ordered  which confirmed the presence of an aortic dissection starting just above the aortic root extending into the descending aorta.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was transferred to Cardiovascular Surgical unit for emergent surgical intervention. The surgery involved removing the area of the aorta that was damaged and replacing it with a synthetic tube. Patient tolerated the procedure well  and the dissection was successfully repaired.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Patient was managed postoperatively in Intensive care unit (ICU). His blood pressure was controlled with labetalol and iv fluids were titrated to maintain adequate cardiac output. The patient was monitored carefully for any sign of postoperative complications including paraplegia  renal insufficiency  and visceral ischemia.   After remaining stable  he was transferred to the ward after two days. Following another week in the ward  he was discharged with instructions for strict blood pressure control  follow-up appointments  medication adjustments  and lifestyle changes including quitting smoking  limiting alcohol consumption  adopting a healthy diet  and increasing physical activity.  He was also recommended to attend genetic counselling to assess the risk for his children.

Aortic Dissection,7,39,Title: Case Report of Aortic Dissection in a Middle Aged African-American Male with a History of Hypertension  1. Patient Information:  The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male reporting severe chest pain that started abruptly.  2. Clinical Findings:  The patient presented to the emergency department accompanied by his wife  who stated that the patient had awoken from sleep with the acute onset of tearing  knife-like chest pain radiating to his back. He reported a pain severity of 10 on a scale of 1-10. His past medical history was significant for untreated hypertension but denied a history of smoking  obesity  or substance abuse  and there was no family history of connective tissue disorders or heart disease.  3. Timeline:  The patient began to experience the symptoms during the early hours of the morning around 2 am. He was brought to the emergency department within 45 minutes of symptom onset.  4. Diagnostic Assessment:  Initially  ECG showed minimal changes. However  upon performing an on-site transthoracic echocardiogram  which proved inadequate due to patient's body habitus  a subsequent CT angiogram confirmed a diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection  extending from the aortic root cardiac chamber to the level of the left subclavian artery. Laboratory data revealed a slightly elevated troponin and aberrations in his complete blood count  renal function  and coagulation panel  likely secondary to the acute aortic dissection.  5. Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery team for emergent surgical repair of his type A aortic dissection. Post-operative transesophageal echocardiography showed a successful repair with no evidence of an intimal flap or pericardial effusion.  6. Follow-up and Outcomes:  The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged home on postoperative day 10 with medication adjustments including the addition of a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for better blood pressure control. The patient agreed to regular follow-ups with his primary care doctor to regulate his blood pressure  along with quarterly visits with his cardiologist for postoperative monitoring. He was also referred to cardiac rehabilitation for regular exercise therapy and lifestyle modification counseling.  7. Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed gratitude for the level of care he received and pledged to pay more attention to his blood pressure control and to lead a healthier lifestyle post-recovery.  8. Teaching Points:  Aortic dissection is a serious condition often associated with a history of hypertension  particularly in the African American population. This case emphasizes the importance of early detection through imaging and prompt surgical management  alongside modifiable risk factor control  all of which significantly improve patient outcomes.   The case also alerts primary care clinicians on the critical consequences of uncontrolled hypertension and the importance of regularly monitoring blood pressure in high-risk patients to prevent such catastrophic events. Furthermore  this case supports the need for routine cardiac rehabilitation post-surgical repair  which significantly contributes to the management of lifestyle modifications and better long-term outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,7,40,"Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 50-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Abstract:  We present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of acute ascending aortic dissection on a background of hypertension.  Case Presentation:  Mr. A  a 50-year-old Caucasian male  arrived at the emergency department (ED) of our hospital complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the back that had started approximately four hours prior to his arrival. The pain was described as """"tearing"""" and was associated with shortness of breath. His medical history disclosed a 10-year history of poorly controlled hypertension  but no other significant diseases were reported.  At presentation  the patient was anxious. His vitals were: blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg  irregularly regular pulse rate of 90 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. His physical examination revealed asymmetric radial pulses and a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed non-specific ST segment changes.  The high suspicion of acute aortic dissection led to immediate computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest  which confirmed the diagnosis of an ascending aortic dissection classified as Stanford Type A. The dissection extended from the ascending aorta into the transverse arch but did not involve the coronary or carotid arteries.  The patient was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive therapy with labetalol to manage his blood pressure and taken to the operating theatre for emergency surgical intervention. Following a successful ascending aortic graft replacement  the patient's hospital course was uneventful.  On follow-up  the patient was enrolled in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program. He was counseled on the importance of rigorous blood pressure control and adherence to his medication regimen. Adjustments made to his antihypertensive regimen resulted in improved hypertension control  and he reported a significant decrease in stress levels.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the potentially fatal condition of aortic dissection  which usually occurs on a background of long-term hypertension. It underscores the importance of quick diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention in ascending aortic dissection  along with subsequent long-term management of hypertension to prevent any recurrence.

Aortic Dissection,7,42,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 57-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: This report describes the clinical presentation  diagnosis  and management of a case of aortic dissection in a 57-year-old Caucasian male. According to available literature  Aortic dissection is more common in males  with incidence peak in the 6th and 7th decades of life  which makes this case not uncommon regarding demographic representation.   Patient Information: The patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male  a resident of Dallas  Texas  with a 20-year history of hypertension. Professionally  he is a solicitor. He has no tobacco use history  but admits to excessive alcohol consumption occasionally. The patient's father died in his early sixties due to a myocardial infarction.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back. The patient described it as 'tearing' and that it began at rest. Accompanying symptoms included diaphoresis and dyspnea.  Diagnostic Assessment: Upon physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be elevated (185/105 mmHg) with a pulse rate of 98 beats per minute. An electrocardiogram showed no MI signs  but a chest radiograph showed mediastinal widening. His D-Dimer level was markedly elevated  necessitating an immediate transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed the presence of an ascending aortic dissection starting just above the aortic root extending up to the aortic arch.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate  followed by nitroprusside to further reduce blood pressure. He underwent emergency surgical repair  specifically  an ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft.   Follow-Up and Outcome: Postoperatively  the patient was managed in the intensive care unit. His blood pressure was carefully monitored and his recovery was uneventful. Before discharge  the prescription included a beta-blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker to control his hypertension. He was advised to undergo a regular follow-up with cardiology for blood pressure control and surveillance scans for potential changes in the residual dissected aorta.  During the 12 month postoperative follow-up  the patient remained asymptomatic with well-controlled blood pressure. Follow up Computed Tomography (CT) confirmed stable residual dissected aorta.  Patient Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in differentially diagnosing patients presenting with chest pain. Early diagnosis with prompt and suitable interventions can result in favorable outcomes even in high-risk surgical candidates such as our patient  who has hypertension.

Aortic Dissection,7,43,"Title: Acute Type B Aortic Dissection in a 72-Year-old Caucasian Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition characterized by a tear in the lining of the aorta. This allows blood to flow between the layers of the aorta  forcing the layers apart. It is associated with hypertension and other heart conditions.  Case Presentation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest and back pain radiating to her abdomen. The patient described the pain as """"tearing” and rated it as 10 on a scale of ten. She also reported profuse sweating  nausea  and shortness of breath. The patient lives in suburban Michigan and is a retired teacher. She has a history of hypertension  mild obesity (BMI of 31)  and hyperlipidemia but no known allergies or family history of aortic diseases. She is a non-smoker  consumes moderate alcohol and has no history of illegal drug use.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  her blood pressure was notably different between arms (160/90 mm Hg on the left and 145/85 mm Hg on the right). The pulse in her right arm was less vigorous compared to the left. She appeared anxious  pale  diaphoretic  and slightly short of breath. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm  normal heart sounds  and no murmurs.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no ischemic changes. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen was performed  which revealed a type B aortic dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the renal arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  She was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to control her hypertension and the pain was managed with morphine. Given her stable condition  she was evaluated for endovascular repair but was deemed not as a candidate because the dissection sandwiched both renal arteries. Thus  a conservative approach with intense blood pressure control was undertaken; she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Her hospital course was uneventful  and her blood pressure and pain were well-controlled. Transthoracic echocardiograms done at her one-month follow-up visit showed no progression of the dissection. She was advised to continue her antihypertensive medication and follow an appropriate diet and lifestyle changes to manage her weight and cholesterol levels. She continues monitoring through periodic imaging.  Conclusion:  This report highlights the importance of prompt recognition and management of aortic dissections  even in patients who might not typically be considered high risk. A high index of suspicion and timely use of appropriate diagnostic tools can significantly impact patient outcomes in this serious condition."
Aortic Dissection,7,44,Title: A Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Caucasian Male   Introduction:  Aortic dissection is a severe condition involving a tear in the wall of the aorta  which can subsequently cause blood to flow between the layers of the aorta wall  forcing the layers apart. Mortality rates are high  especially in elderly populations.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient expressed that the onset of the pain was sudden  describing it as a sharp and tearing sensation.  Demographics: The patient is retired  married with three adult children  and lives in the suburbs. He is a former smoker (quit 10 years prior) and consumed alcohol moderately (1-2 drinks/week). He is relatively sedentary  and his typical diet is rich in sodium and unhealthy fats.  Medical History: The patient's medical background includes a 20-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and was on medication (amlodipine 5mg once daily). Additionally  he was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago and was prescribed metformin. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having suffered a stroke at the age of 60.   Physical Examination and Diagnostic Assessment: Upon physical examination  the patient's blood pressure was found to be significantly higher in the right arm versus the left. Heart sounds were normal  but a diastolic murmur was audible. His pulses were palpable but weaker in the lower extremities compared to the upper extremities.   A rapid ECG did not indicate any signs of myocardial ischemia. Laboratory findings demonstrated slightly elevated D-dimer levels  prompting immediate CT Angiography. The imaging study uncovered an aortic dissection starting just above the aortic root and extending into the descending aorta. Following the DeBakey system  this is classified as a type II dissection.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was promptly started on medication to lower his blood pressure and heart rate  including labetalol and nitroprusside to prevent further enlargement of the aortic dissection. Given the severity and extent of the aortic dissection  the patient was quickly scheduled for an emergency surgical intervention - ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The surgery was performed without any complications. Post-operative care included pain management  continuation of anti-hypertensive medication  and regular monitoring of vital signs and heart function. The patient was discharged on the tenth postoperative day with instructions for follow-up CT angiography and outpatient rehabilitation.   Conclusion: Accurate and quick diagnosis is vital in aortic dissection cases  as timely intervention can significantly lower the otherwise high mortality rate. More widespread education among health care providers on recognising the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection could improve patient outcomes considerably.  Ethics Statement: Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images was obtained from the patient.

He works as a construction worker and lives with his wife in the suburbs of Houston  Texas. He has a history of consuming alcohol and smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years. He also has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for ten years but reports non-compliance with his hypertensive medication.  Clinical Findings: On presentation  Mr. N's pain was described as “tearing” and “sharp """" with an intensity of 10 on the Visual Analogue Scale. His blood pressure was found to be 190/105 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 96 beats/min. Other vitals included respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min and SpO2 98% on room air. There were no significant findings from the physical examination except for pain on palpation in the epigastric area.  Timeline: Mr. N was transferred to the Emergency Department (ED) within 15 minutes of his arrival at the hospital. Initial lab investigations and Chest X-ray were done within the first hour of his arrival at the ED. The Chest x-ray did not reveal any abnormalities. His EKG did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia. Blood tests showed slightly elevated D-dimer.  Diagnostic Assessment: In view of the elevated D-dimer  sudden onset severe chest pain and a history of uncontrolled hypertension  a CT aortogram was decided  which confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending to the arch.  Therapeutic Interventions: Considering the ascending location of the dissection  surgical intervention was deemed necessary. Mr. N underwent an emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft under hypothermic circulatory arrest. His postoperative period in the ICU was uneventful  and he was discharged home on postoperative day 7 after a brief rehabilitation period.  Follow-up and Outcomes: He was prescribed anti-hypertensives and was strictly counseled on compliance with the medication. He was also advised to quit smoking and moderate his alcohol consumption. Follow-up appointments were scheduled. On his first-month follow-up  he reported cessation of smoking and compliance with medicines  which substantially reduced his blood pressure to 135/85 mmHg.  Discussion: This case study highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with sudden chest pain  particularly in those with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. Prompt diagnosis and management via a multidisciplinary approach remain key for survival. Further  this case underscores the importance of counseling and follow-up to ensure medication compliance and lifestyle modification  such as smoking cessation  to manage long term cardiovascular risks. Another thing to note is the greater frequency of aortic dissection in males compared to females and the increased prevalence in the sixth decade of life. Hispanic patients such as Mr. N also tend to experience a higher prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension  a crucial risk factor for aortic dissection  highlighting the need for more proactive care in this population demographic."

Aortic Dissection,7,48,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 70-Year-Old Male: A Case Report  I. Introduction  Aortic dissection is a potentially lethal medical emergency typically seen in males over the age of 60  with risk factors including hypertension  atherosclerosis  and congenital conditions such as Marfan Syndrome. Its timely identification and treatment are of paramount importance.  II. Patient information  Demographics  We present a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a sudden and severe chest pain.   Presenting complaint  The patient described the pain as tearing  radiating to the back. He also complained of shortness of breath but denied any episodes of syncope  lower extremity weakness  or parasthesias. His Blood Pressure (BP) was 210/110 mmHg on presentation.  III. Clinical Findings  The patient showed signs of distress and was diaphoretic on physical examination. His pulse was irregular  with a rate of around 110 beats per minute. He had high blood pressure and an early diastolic murmur was heard on auscultation.  IV. Timeline  History/ Past Medical History  The patient had a 20-year history of uncontrolled hypertension  a documented history of mild aortic stenosis  and had no known drug allergies. There was no family history of Marfan syndrome or any other connective tissue diseases that could predispose him to aortic catastrophes.  V. Diagnostic Assessment   The EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with his long-standing hypertension. His chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum. The definitive diagnosis was reached with the help of a CT angiogram  which showed an Intimal flap in the ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta with a false lumen  revealing a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention   The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for a successful Bentall procedure to repair his dissected aorta. His post-operative course was uneventful  and he was discharged on lifelong beta-blocker therapy to control his hypertension and reduce shear force on the vasculature.  In summary  this case highlights the importance of considering an aortic dissection in geriatric patients presenting with sudden unexplained severe chest or back pain  especially in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension. The patient's age  gender  and hypertension are consistent with documented risk factors for aortic dissection. Thoughtful management and multidisciplinary collaboration are the cornerstones for successful outcomes.  VII. Follow-up and Outcomes  The follow-up assessment after six months revealed the patient to be asymptomatic with well-controlled blood pressure. The Chest CT done after six months showed no signs of re-dissection.    VIII. Patient Perspective  The patient reported substantial improvement in his quality of life post-surgery and expressed gratitude for lifesaving intervention and continued postoperative care.   IX. Conclusion  This case reinforces the ongoing challenge that aortic dissection presents in clinical practice. A high index of suspicion and prompt diagnostic escalation is required given the potentially fatal consequences of missed or delayed diagnosis. 
Aortic Dissection,7,49,"Title: A Case of Acute Aortic Dissection in a 67-year-old African American Male with a History of Hypertension  Introduction:  This case report presents a 67-year-old African American male patient diagnosed with acute aortic dissection. He was previously diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was a former smoker  giving up the habit 10 years prior to his aortic dissection diagnosis.  Case Presentation:  The patient was brought to the emergency department due to sudden  severe chest and back pain described as """"tearing"""" in nature. His symptoms included vomiting  profuse sweating  slight tingling in his left arm  and difficulty in breathing. He reported the pain as most intense in his chest  particularly in the upper region and extending to his back. He was conscious  oriented  slightly tachypneic but not cyanotic upon admission.  His records revealed he had been on treatment for hypertension (carvedilol) and hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin) for the past 12 years. The patient was a retired steelworker and led a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement. Despite his regular medical treatments  his blood pressure had been poorly controlled over the past year  with recent readings frequently exceeding 160/90 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI) calculated to be 29 indicating overweight. He had quit smoking roughly ten years ago  after a 30-year smoking history.  A physical examination revealed a blood pressure reading of 190/100 mmHg in his right arm and 150/90 mmHg in his left arm. Heart and lung auscultation identified minor differences in breath sounds  but no murmur was detected. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of myocardial infarction.  An urgent Transthoracic Echocardiogram was indicative of an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  which was further confirmed by a CT angiogram. Subsequently  an acute Stanford type A aortic dissection was diagnosed.  Intervention:  Emergency surgical repair was performed  which involved replacing the ascending aorta. Post-operation  the patient received intensive care  including blood pressure control with labetalol  pain management  and anticoagulation therapy. His post-operative course was uneventful.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of appropriate management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors  given the association with life-threatening conditions like aortic dissection. It also emphasizes the need for high clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic measures to ensure timely diagnosis and management.  This case also presents a unique instance within the general demographic as African Americans are less frequently diagnosed with aortic dissection compared to their Caucasian counterparts.   Patient confidentiality was strictly maintained; all personally identifiable information was removed. "
Aortic Dissection,7,50,Title: Emergency Management of Type A Aortic Dissection in a 56-Year-Old White Male: A Case Report  INTRODUCTION:   This case report describes a patient who presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain and was subsequently diagnosed with type A aortic dissection.   CASE PRESENTATION:  The patient was a 56-year-old Caucasian male who was seen in the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as tearing in nature  and it was associated with profuse sweating and shortness of breath. The patient was a long-standing smoker with a 20 pack-year history and had uncontrolled hypertension for five years. His family history showed that his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50.  On examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different between the two arms with the higher measurement on the right arm. Physical examination also revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic area that could indicate an aortic insufficiency. Otherwise  his physical examination was unremarkable.  Given the symptoms and differential blood pressure  a working diagnosis of acute aortic dissection was made. Confirmation of diagnosis was achieved using a computed tomographic angiography (CTA)  which confirmed an ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A) extending towards the right common iliac artery.  The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac surgical unit for emergency surgery. After a successful ascending aortic graft replacement and aortic valve resuspension  the patient was transferred to ICU for post-operative management.  DISCUSSION:  The patient's smoking history and unmanaged hypertension increased his risk for developing an aortic dissection. Studies indicate a higher prevalence of aortic dissections among white males over 40  due to hypertension and other risk factors like genetic conditions  high cholesterol levels  or atherosclerosis. This case exemplifies the necessity of early detection and the essential role of imaging in confirming the diagnosis.  CONCLUSION:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute chest pain  particularly in those with risk factors such as hypertension or who have a significant difference in bilateral arm blood pressures. Prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention remain critical for survival.  KEYWORDS: aortic dissection  type A aortic dissection  emergency surgery  chest pain  hypertension.

Aortic Dissection,7,52,"Title: Aortic Dissection in a Hypertensive Elderly Male: A Case Report  Case Description:  Patient Information:  Mr. A  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the emergency department of our hospital. He is a retired lawyer  living with his wife in a suburb and is financially stable. His wife reported that he has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks alcohol moderately and has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings:  The patient reported experiencing sudden  severe chest pain that started about an hour before arrival. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  radiating to his back. On presenting at the ER  his blood pressure was found to be elevated at 170/95 mmHg  and his heart rate was at 110 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis and distress due to pain but no obvious deformities or disabilities.   Medical History:  The patient has been suffering from hypertension for the past 15 years  which has been moderately controlled with a routine regimen of hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin. He has no history of diabetes or any major surgeries. His family history includes the death of his father from a stroke at the age of 68  and his mother suffers from hypertension and dementia.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the presenting symptoms and history of hypertension  a suspicion of aortic dissection was considered. A CT angiogram was urgently ordered  confirming the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Other relevant lab findings included elevated D-dimer levels and mild renal impairment indicated by elevated creatinine levels.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to control his blood pressure and heart rate. After initial stabilization  he was referred for emergent surgical treatment. An ascending aorta replacement with a synthetic graft was performed successfully.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient made an uneventful recovery postoperatively. His blood pressure was well controlled on labetalol and losartan. At a 3-month follow-up session  the patient reported adhering to his antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation.  Discussion:  This case underscores the significance of considering aortic dissection in elderly patients with a history of hypertension who present with severe chest pain. Early recognition and prompt medical and surgical intervention are key in improving the prognosis.  Conclusion:  This case report suggests the critical role of primary care physicians and ER doctors in being vigilant about aortic dissection in hypertensive patients  especially considering that prompt diagnosis and management can significantly impact survival.

Aortic Dissection,7,53,Title: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 66-year-old Caucasian Male with a History of Hypertension and Smoking  Abstract: This case report discusses an incident of acute aortic dissection (AD) in a 66-year-old Caucasian male with a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and smoking. Aortic dissection is a critical condition often linked to hypertension and tobacco use. The patient's demographics  comorbidities  clinical course  diagnosis  and management are detailed.  Case Presentation: Mr. X  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital with severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as tearing and migrating. The patient’s medical history included uncontrolled hypertension  a smoking habit of 20 cigarettes a day for the last 45 years  and no reported history of heart disease or diabetes in his family. The patient also reported no recent trauma.  Upon physical examination  the patient had disparate upper and lower extremity blood pressures  with an absence of femoral pulses. He was mildly tachycardic  and an ECG showed nonspecific ST-segment changes. There were no signs of heart failure  though the patient was hypertensive and his extremity examination was consistent with peripheral vascular disease.  A chest X-ray indicated an enlargement of the mediastinal silhouette. Subsequent tests  including a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest  confirmed the diagnosis of an acute ascending (Type A) aortic dissection  beginning just above the aortic root and extending into the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.  Management: Once diagnosed with Type A aortic dissection  the patient was promptly administered beta-blockers and nitroprusside to control his blood pressure and heart rate. He was immediately transferred to a higher-level cardiac care center where he underwent successful emergency surgery for the dissection. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was later transferred to the intensive care unit for observation.  After the operation  the patient was put on a long-term management plan of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy  coupled with lifestyle changes  including smoking cessation  a low-salt diet  and a regular low-impact exercise routine.  Conclusion: This case underscores the life-threatening nature of aortic dissection  the critical role of early diagnosis  and the need for appropriate intervention. Acute aortic dissection being a rare condition  this detailed case study provides valuable insight into the course of a speedy diagnosis and successful treatment of a 66-year-old Caucasian male patient suffering from acute aortic dissection with a history of hypertension and smoking. It also highlights the importance of long-term management to prevent recurrence.
Aortic Dissection,7,54,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 70-year-old Hispanic Male with a History of Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Report  Patient Information: A 70-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint: The patient complained of severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 20 years. He also suffers from type II diabetes mellitus  but denied any history of familial cardiovascular diseases or any connective tissue disorder.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was conscious but visibly distressed and diaphoretic. His vitals showed blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg and an irregular heart rate of 96 bpm. A difference in blood pressure between his arms was noted  with the left arm having lower readings than the right.  Diagnostic Assessment: The electrocardiogram revealed no signs of acute myocardial infarction. However  chest X-ray showed an enlarged mediastinum. A subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta  the aortic arch  and descending aorta (type A aortic dissection). Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels  contributing to the diagnosis.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive drugs to ensure blood pressure and heart rate control. Following stabilization  he underwent emergent surgical repair which included an ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement alongside coronary reimplantation due to involvement of the coronary ostia.   Outcome: The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was transferred to the recovery ward and gradually weaned off from the support. His postoperative CT scan after a week showed successful repair without any residual dissection. He was started on lifelong antihypertensive medication and was discharged home in a stable condition with the advice of regular follow-ups.  Conclusion: This case underlines the critical role of a timely diagnosis and intervention in patients presenting with aortic dissection. Given the high mortality rate associated with aortic dissection  a high index of suspicion  particularly in patients with long-term hypertension  can be lifesaving. Additionally  prompt surgical intervention remains the mainstay of management  especially in type A aortic dissection  as in our patient case.

She is a retired nurse  lives alone  and manages her daily activities independently. She has a 45-pack-year smoking history  until she quit at the age of 65. Additionally  she has a history of chronic hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has no prior history of heart diseases.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. M presented in the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe tearing chest pain that radiated to her back. She associated this pain with shortness of breath and feelings of anxiety.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  she was anxious  in distress with pallor  diaphoretic  and had an irregular pulse of 110 beats per minute. The Blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg in her right arm and 150/90 mmHg in the left arm. Cardiac and lung auscultation revealed no adventitious sounds. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy  but no signs of myocardial ischemia. Initial laboratory results demonstrated elevated D-dimer levels suggestive of aortic dissection. Given the classic history and hypertension  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was promptly conducted which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  Stanford type A  involving the ascending aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention: She was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to decrease her heart rate and blood pressure. The surgical team was urgently consulted and she underwent successful emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft. She was also started on lifelong anti-hypertensive therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Postoperatively  she recovered well without any complications. Echocardiography before discharge showed a good functioning aortic valve and no pericardial effusion. At follow-up 1 month post-discharge  she remained symptom-free with well-controlled blood pressure.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and prompt surgical intervention in acute aortic dissection. Despite her advanced age and numerous comorbidities  the patient experienced a successful outcome because of the immediate treatment measures undertaken. It is crucial for clinicians to consider acute aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis when an elderly patient presents with sudden severe chest or back pain  especially if they have a history of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.   This case also emphasizes the importance of postoperative management and regular follow-ups  as well as the significance of managing the underlying risk factors  particularly hypertension  to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
Aortic Dissection,7,56,Title: Aortic Dissection in a Hypertensive Elderly Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection is a serious condition characterized by a tear in the aorta's lining  leading to disruption of blood flow and potentially life-threatening complications. This case report presents a 72-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with acute aortic dissection and underlying hypertension  discussing the associated clinical manifestations  work-up  and management plan.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 72-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of hypertension  presented to the emergency room with sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as tearing and had commenced suddenly about 3 hours prior to presentation. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg  pulse 90 beats/min  temperature 98.2°F and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min.  The patient has a 30 pack-year smoking history and has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications. He disputes having any notable previous cardiac issues and denies drug allergies. His family history is significant for a brother who passed away in his 60s due to a heart attack.  Upon physical examination  there was a noted disparity in femoral and radial pulses. Chest auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur indicating aortic regurgitation. Neurological assessment revealed no abnormalities and no signs of stroke. There was no evidence of Marfan’s Syndrome  Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome  or other conditions traditionally linked to aortic dissection.  Investigations:  Laboratory findings revealed elevated D-dimer levels and Troponin-T  suggesting cardiac damage. A 12-lead ECG was normal  showing no signs of myocardial infarction. As clinical suspicion of acute aortic dissection was high  a Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) of the chest was urgently ordered  confirming the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection  extending from the ascending to descending aorta.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was emergently taken to surgery for aortic root and ascending aorta replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) post-surgery showed no dissection flap  no aortic regurgitation  and adequately functioning prosthetic aortic valve. The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit postoperatively and started on anti-hypertensive therapy and regular follow-ups were scheduled.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the need for high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest pain and a history of hypertension. Prompt diagnostic imaging and surgical intervention significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Close blood pressure control is crucial in managing such patients to prevent recurrent dissection or rupture post-surgery. This case also underlines the importance of medication adherence  particularly among patients with chronic cardiovascular conditions.  
Aortic Dissection,7,57,Title: Acute Type B Aortic Dissection in a 57-year-old Asian Male with Uncorrected Hypertension  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a severe and life-threatening condition associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis  among other things. Despite improved comprehension and advancements in therapy  the mortality rate remains high  with early diagnosis and intervention being crucial in improving prognosis.  Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 57-year-old Asian male  a longstanding smoker with a 15-pack year history  originally from South Korea but now residing in the United States. His occupation involves a sedentary desk job. The patient lives with his wife  and they have no children. He reports social alcohol use but denies any illicit drug use. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases; his father died from myocardial infarction at age 60  and his maternal uncle had a stroke at 68.  The patient's medical history is remarkable for hypertension which had been undiagnosed and untreated for at least ten years. The patient rarely sought medical intervention and did not follow up as recommended. Apart from hypertension  he has hypercholesterolemia and had been non-compliant with his statin therapy. He had no history of surgeries or allergies.   In terms of review of systems  a recent sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back was reported. Pain was described as being 10 on a scale of 1 to 10  starting while at rest  with no precipitating events.  Discussion:  Upon admission  the patient's blood pressure was markedly elevated (200/110 mmHg)  with a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute. He was afebrile and had a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His weight was 98 Kg and height 175 cm  yielding a body mass index (BMI) of 31.9  categorized as obese.  Apart from elevated blood pressure  the patient’s physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests showed slightly elevated white blood cells counts and mildly reduced hemoglobin level (12g/dL). The liver and kidney function tests  along with lipid profile and cardiac biomarkers  came back within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram showed non-specific ST-segment changes.   An emergency computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest was then performed revealing an acute type B aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending down to the aortic bifurcation  with no signs of rupture.  Given the patient's presenting symptoms  hypertensive status  and CT findings  he was diagnosed with acute type B aortic dissection.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of routine medical check-ups and adherence to prescribed medication therapy  particularly among hypertensive individuals. Inadequately controlled cardiovascular risk factors can lead to life-threatening complications such as aortic dissection. Even though the patient survived the acute phase of the event  his long-term prognosis is uncertain and depends on how well he can control his risk factors in the future. 
Aortic Dissection,7,58,"Title: A Rare Case of Aortic Dissection in a 52-Year-Old Male with No Prior Cardiovascular History  Introduction:   Aortic dissection (AD) is a rare but life-threatening condition often associated with hypertension and in relatively older individuals. It is a result of separation of the layers within the aorta  affecting mostly males and those with a history of cardiac diseases. However  its sudden occurrence in a relatively younger patient  without any preexisting heart conditions  is a rarity.  Case Presentation:  Patient Description: The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male  a non-smoker  and maintains a moderate alcohol intake. His body mass index (BMI) is 24  which is considered as a healthy weight. He has no known medial allergies and his family health history does not include any cardiovascular diseases.  Past Medical History: He has been treated for Type 2 Diabetes for the past 10 years. The disease is well-controlled with metformin. Aside from this  the patient's medical history is unremarkable. He has no past history of hypertension  high cholesterol levels  or any cardiac diseases. He has never undergone any kind of surgery before. This makes him an atypical candidate for aortic dissection.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with sudden-onset chest pain that started while he was performing light physical activity (gardening). The pain was severe and radiated to his back. He described it as a """"tearing"""" sensation that did not diminish with rest or over-the-counter pain medication.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his blood pressure was found to be severely elevated (190/110 mm Hg). Critical laboratory findings included: Hematocrit: 38.6%  Platelets: 184 000 per cubic millimeter  Glucose: 231mg/dL  and B-type natriuretic peptide: 81 pg/mL. An electrocardiogram showed non-specific ST-segment changes but no signs of myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening.  Diagnosis: Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed an aortic dissection starting at the ascending aorta and extending to the abdominal aorta. This was classified as a Stanford Type A dissection.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce heart rate and blood pressure. He was taken to the operating room for an emergency surgical repair involving replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch with a graft.  Outcome: The patient’s post-operative recovery was uneventful and he was discharged home 8 days after surgery. He has been prescribed lifelong antihypertensive medication and regularly monitored to prevent hypertension.  Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of considering aortic dissection even in younger patients without pre-existing cardiac disease but presenting with sudden-onset severe chest pain. The patient’s diabetes may have been a contributing factor to the development of the dissection  implying a need for high clinical suspicion in such patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment lead to a positive clinical outcome in this patient."
Aortic Dissection,7,59,Title: Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Asian Male: A Case Report   Case Introduction:  Mr. J  a 55-year-old Asian male with a significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and chronic smoking  presented to the emergency department in severe distress. He experienced sudden onset  sharp  severe chest pain radiating to his back.  Clinical Findings:  On arrival  the patient appeared pale and diaphoretic. He reported nausea and feeling palpitations. Initial vitals pointed towards tachycardia (heart rate: 110/min) and high blood pressure (BP: 170/100 mmHg). The physical examination revealed unequal blood pressures in both arms  a diastolic murmur  and decreased peripheral pulses.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An immediate EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and no acute ischemic changes. Chest radiography demonstrated a widening mediastinum. The findings warranted suspicion of aortic dissection  subsequently confirmed through a CT angiogram  revealing Stanford Type A dissection beginning just past the aortic valve and extending into the ascending aorta.  Therapeutic Interventions:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to control hypertension and heart rate. He was taken to the surgical suite for an emergency ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement surgery with a mechanical valve with an uneventful intraoperative course. The patient's postoperative story was complicated with temporary renal impairment  but he responded adequately to conservative management.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Mr. J had a considerable recovery and was discharged home after 14 days. He was advised to follow up with the cardiology and surgery departments after one month. Anti-hypertensive medication was optimized  and the importance of medication compliance was highlighted. He also agreed to smoking cessation counseling. At his 1 month follow-up appointment  his blood pressure was well controlled  and he reported no recurrence of chest pain.  Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of recognizing the classical presenting symptoms of aortic dissection quickly  considering it in hypertensive patients who present with severe sharp chest pain  and the life-saving role of early surgical intervention. It also emphasizes the role of managing modifiable risk factors  such as hypertension and smoking  in preventing such vascular emergencies.
Aortic Dissection,7,60,Case Report: Acute Aortic Disfunction  Patient Information:  A 60-year-old Hispanic male patient  a resident of Brooklyn  New York  presented with sudden onset severe chest and back pain. The patient is an ex-smoker with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient had no family history of cardiovascular diseases  but he was overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.   The patient worked in a high-stress environment with a sedentary lifestyle and confessed to often resorting to fast food due to work pressure. He gave up smoking years before but had failed attempts to consistently manage his hypertension  despite being on antihypertensives and statins. He expressed never having experienced such pain before and showed a level of anxiety that was consistent with the intensity of his discomfort.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and distressed. Initial vitals showed a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg  pulse- 105 beats/minute irregular  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. No significant findings detected on pulmonary  cardiac  or abdominal evaluation  however  he had unequal radial pulses and blood pressure differentials between the upper limbs.  Diagnosis  Treatment  and Outcome:  Laboratory studies were normal except an elevated D-dimer test. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes. The chest x-ray did not show any mediastinal widening. However  due to the high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection  a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was urgently performed  revealing a Stanford type A aortic dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending to the iliac arteries.  Emergent cardiothoracic surgery consultation was made. The patient underwent successful ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft. His postoperative course was uneventful except for temporary post-operative atrial fibrillation which was managed with amiodarone. He was discharged home on postoperative day 10 on antihypertensives  statin  and regular follow up was arranged with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. Patient education was provided regarding the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications.  In this case  all typical risk factors  i.e.  uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  age  smoking history  and male gender  converged  resulting in a potentially catastrophic aortic dissection. The early identification and management of this case highlight the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion in patients with risk factors presenting with severe chest and back pain.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of any patient with chest or back pain  especially if there's a history of hypertension. It also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modification and the management of modifiable risk factors in preventing the catastrophic events.
Aortic Dissection,7,61,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Hispanic Male: A Case Report  Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Hispanic male presented to our emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiated to the back for the past 3 hours. He reported feeling unusually short of breath and was visibly distressed.  Patient Information: The patient was a retired manual laborer  with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  hyperlipidemia  and a 30 pack-year smoking history which the patient quit 5 years ago. He admitted irregular adherence to his prescribed anti-hypertensive medications. He denied any family history of cardiovascular diseases. On physical examination  the patient had asymmetric blood pressure readings in his upper extremities  a pertinent positive finding in such case.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed the patient was hypertensive  with blood pressure recorded as 165/115 mmHg in his left arm  and 145/85 mmHg on the right arm. His heart rate was 105 bpm  breathing rate 22 bpm  and oxygen saturation 94%. During auscultation  a faint early diastolic murmur was noted.  Diagnostic Assessments: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no signs of acute myocardial infarction. Due to the suspicion of aortic dissection  a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest was promptly requested. It confirmed an ascending aortic dissection  categorized as Stanford type A  that extended to the descending thoracic aorta.  Therapeutic Interventions: The patient was immediately started on pain relief medication and antihypertensive drugs in the ED. Given that he had a Stanford type A dissection  emergent surgical intervention was indicated  thus a cardiothoracic surgery consultation was placed promptly. The patient subsequently underwent successful emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement surgery  with minimal post-operative complications.  Follow-up and Outcomes: On the patient’s one month follow-up visit to the outpatient clinic  he reported significant improvement in symptoms. His blood pressure was well-controlled  and he showed good adherence to the prescribed medications. He has been enlisted in a cardiac rehabilitation program and is being regularly monitored.  Clinical Relevance: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt intervention for acute aortic dissection  a medical emergency. Despite advances in imaging  aortic dissection remains under-recognized and is often lethal. Physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in hypertensive patients presenting with atypical chest pain and unequal blood pressures in the upper limbs. The patient's ethnicity also sheds light on the health disparities in minority populations  with under-treatment of hypertension being frequently reported in the Hispanic community. 
Aortic Dissection,7,62,Title: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection in a 62-year-old Caucasian Male with a Previous History of Uncontrolled Hypertension  Demographic Information Patient: Mr. X  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Complaint: Severe chest pain radiating to the back  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which was diagnosed 10 years ago. Records show a consistent pattern of poor blood pressure control with multiple readings in the range of 160/100mmHg. In addition  Mr. X has a history of smoking - one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. Past records also revealed a familial history of cardiovascular disease  with both parents dying of myocardial infarction in their early sixties. His medical history was otherwise insignificant. The patient denied any possible recreational drug use and does not consume alcohol.  Clinical Examination: On examination  Mr. X appeared in severe distress  sweating profusely and hyperventilating. He was conscious  oriented  but seemed to have pale discoloration. His vital signs on admission were: blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg  an irregular and rapid heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (normal: 12−20 breaths per minute)  and a body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. His BMI (Body mass index) was 28  placing him in the overweight category.   There was no symmetry in his blood pressure readings between the right and left arms - 170/110 mmHg and 155/95 mmHg respectively. On auscultating the chest  there seemed to be a distant heart sound  suggestive of a pericardial effusion. The respiratory examination was unremarkable; however  a neurologic exam indicated mild weakness of the patient's right lower extremity.   Investigations:  An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed an intimal flap with a dissection that started just after the aortic valve and extended into the descending aorta. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer levels. A CT angiogram of the chest confirmed the presence of an aortic dissection involving the ascending and descending aorta.   Treatment: Given the involvement of the ascending aorta  the case was diagnosed as Stanford Type A aortic dissection. The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for an emergency surgical repair  which involved a Bentall's procedure with a mechanical heart valve and graft replacement of the ascending aorta. Post-operatively  the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for surveillance.  Conclusion: The occurrence of aortic dissection in this patient underscores the importance of regular monitoring and adequate management of blood pressure  particularly in patients with a long history of uncontrolled hypertension. Early diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention undoubtedly played a significant role in preventing potential complications and mortalities associated with this life-threatening condition.  Acknowledgements:  I would like to express my gratitude to the cardiac surgical team and the nursing staff for their quick actions and professional dedication in managing this case.
Aortic Dissection,7,63,Title: Emergent Diagnosis of Acute Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Caucasian Male  Introduction  This case report presents the scenario of a 65-year-old Caucasian male who was emergently diagnosed with an acute aortic dissection  illuminating the importance of rapid diagnosis and intervention for survival rate improvement.  Demographic Information and Clinical History  Our patient  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to his back. He was a former smoker  and his past medical history included hypertension and a moderate aortic aneurysm detected 2 years ago  which was being regularly followed-up with echocardiography. The patient also has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of myocardial infarction at a similar age. His current medications are Lisinopril 10 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for blood pressure control as well as daily aspirin 81 mg for primary prevention of ischemic heart disease.  Clinical Assessment  On admission  he appeared acutely ill  with diaphoresis and somewhat altered mentation. His pulse was 100 bpm  blood pressure was 210/100 mmHg  and his respiration rate was 28 breaths per minute. The other primary physical exam findings were a harsh systolic murmur and decreased breath sounds on the right side of his chest. His ECG showed nonspecific ST-wave changes but was otherwise normal.  Management and Outcome  The patient's hemodynamic instability  along with his immediate pain  initially led us to suspect acute coronary syndromes. However  given his history of hypertension  aortic aneurysm  and the presentation of his chest pain  an emergent CT angiography was ordered to rule out aortic dissection. The scan indeed revealed a DeBakey type I dissection starting at the ascending aorta and extending into the descending aorta. This necessitated an immediate transfer to a tertiary care facility for possible surgical intervention.  Surgical intervention was successful  and the patient was discharged after a 14-day hospital stay with close follow-up appointments with a cardiologist and primary care physician. The patient was started on ivabradine and within a month' follow-up his heart rate and BP were well controlled. Despite experiencing minor post-operative complications  including shortness of breath and fatigue  the follow-up echocardiogram showed a normal aortic size with no residual leak.  Discussion  This case underlines the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially when the patient displays hypertension  family history of cardiovascular disease  and a past medical history of aortic aneurysm. Rapid diagnosis and intervention can significantly increase the patient’s chance of survival.  Conclusion  The management of acute aortic dissection is a medical emergency and remains a clinical challenge. It requires a strong index of suspicion  urgent diagnostic confirmation  and prompt treatment initiation  either surgical or medical. 
Aortic Dissection,7,64,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 54-year-old Male with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report  Abstract: We describe the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with a history of severe chest pain  radiating to the back. He was diagnosed with an acute Type A aortic dissection. This patient had a known history of hypertension / high blood pressure that was poorly controlled.  Case Presentation: A 54-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the Emergency Department with an abrupt onset of severe chest pain  which started during rest  radiating through to the back. The pain was described as sharp in nature  scored as 8 out of 10 on a pain rating scale. The patient also mentioned a history of uncontrolled hypertension. He denied a family history of cardiovascular disease or any genetic connective tissue diseases. The patient had a 30-year smoking history but denied use of alcohol or illicit drugs.   Examination and Imaging: On physical examination  he appeared anxious with a blood pressure of 180/100mmHg and a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Heart sounds were normal with no audible murmur. There was no asymmetric pulse or blood pressure between both arms. The ECG showed non-specific ST changes but no signs of ischemia. Chest X-ray suggested a widened mediastinum. A subsequent CT aortogram confirmed a Type A aortic dissection involving the ascending thoracic aorta and descending aorta  with no evidence of rupture or end-organ ischaemia.  Management and Outcomes: After lab results were obtained and the diagnosis was confirmed  the patient was immediately started on anti-hypertensive medication intravenously to control his blood pressure  in preparation for surgery. He underwent emergent ascending aortic hemiarch replacement with open surgical aortic repair. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. The patient completed an in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation program and was discharged with prescribed life-long antihypertensive medication. Follow-up at 1  3  6  and 12 months confirmed that the patient was doing well  remaining compliant with medications  engaging in lifestyle modification as well as regular surveillance imaging.  Discussion: This case exemplifies the potentially catastrophic outcome of poorly controlled hypertension. It also highlights the importance of immediate recognition of aortic dissection symptoms  as early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in the management of such cases. Aortic dissection continues to be a challenging clinical condition with a high risk of mortality and morbidity if left untreated.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.
Aortic Dissection,7,65,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report   Introduction:  This case report details the presentation  diagnosis  and treatment of a 68-year-old Caucasian male patient who was admitted with an aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a catastrophic cardiovascular event characterized by a tear in the intima of the aorta  which allows for blood to flow into the tunica media  creating a false lumen.   Case Presentation:  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  who was a non-smoker and drank alcohol occasionally  was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of severe  sudden-onset chest pain that radiated to his back  accompanied by shortness of breath. He reported that his father had a history of aortic aneurysm and his elder brother had undergone cardiac surgery. His past medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia  which was treated with antihypertensives and statins respectively. He had no known drug allergies.   Physical examination showed an elevated blood pressure (178/105 mmHg)  tachycardia (heart rate 111 bpm)  a normal body mass index  and no signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy but no evidence of myocardial infarction. His laboratory tests revealed a slight elevation in D-dimer level and mild leukocytosis but no significant changes in cardiac enzymes (troponin).  The patient underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) after his ECG and blood tests showed no signs inflammatory changes indicative of myocardial infarction. CTA revealed an aortic dissection starting after the arch and extending downward to the level of the renal arteries  confirming a type B  Stanford classification  a dissection.   Management:  Given his classification and compliance with medication  conservative management was initiated  including strict blood pressure control using beta-blockers  calcium channel blockers  and ACE inhibitors. The patient was also given pain medication for symptomatic relief. His blood pressure was monitored hourly to ensure optimal control.   Outcome:  The patient responded well to the treatment  with gradual relief from the pain. Repeat CTA after a week showed no progression of the dissection. He was discharged with advice on lifestyle modifications  adherence to medications  and the necessity of regular follow-up examinations  stressing the importance of immediately reporting any chest pain.   Conclusion:  In this case  a definitive diagnosis of the aortic dissection was made based on the patient's unique presentation and imaging studies. Timely conservative management led to a favorable outcome for the patient  emphasizing the importance of early recognition and treatment of this potentially fatal condition. Continuous monitoring and patient education regarding adherence to medication and lifestyle changes are necessary for preventing further complications. This case highlights the requirement of high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute chest or back pain  especially with a history of hypertension and familial cardiovascular disorders.
Aortic Dissection,7,66,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in an Aging White Male: A Case Report  Case Description:  The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden and severe tearing chest pain. The patient reports the pain commenced while watching television around two hours prior and was experiencing symptoms at rest.  Physical examination in the ED revealed a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg in his left arm and 150/90 mmHg in his right arm. The rest of his physical evaluation  including a neurological exam  was normal  but his pain and discomfort persisted. The patient is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and has no history of recreational drug use. His diet is generally low in fruits and vegetables and high in processed and red meats.  Additionally  the patient has a significant past medical history. Seven years prior  he had a myocardial infarction for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 13 years prior. The patient has been on oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his diabetes and is under cardioprotective aspirin and a statin for his cardiac history.  An immediate electrocardiogram was performed  which showed no signs of ongoing myocardial infarction. Based on the presenting symptoms  the clinical suspicion of an aortic dissection was high. A subsequent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest confirmed the presence of a type B aortic dissection extending from the descending aorta to the level of the renal arteries.  The patient's case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgery  and the decision was to manage it conservatively given the location of the dissection. Following admission to the hospital  aggressive medical management was initiated using beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to control hypertension and heart rate  as well as close monitoring of blood pressure and pain control.  The patient responded well to initial medical treatment  and his pain was controlled adequately. The patient was educated about the signs of further dissection or rupture to seek immediate medical attention. He continues to follow-up on an outpatient basis with cardiology. His case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management of aortic dissection for improved patient prognosis.  Based on these observations  this case falls in line with data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD)  showing that the majority of aortic dissections occur in white males  aged over 60 years  with high blood pressure and preexisting aortic atherosclerosis. It serves as a poignant reminder to have a high index of clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in at-risk patients presenting with atypical chest pain.

Clinical findings: Mr. SK presented to the emergency department (ER) complaining of severe  sharp  """"tearing"""" chest pain that started suddenly about 3 hours ago. It began at the center of his chest and radiated to his back  particularly between the shoulder blades. He also reported dyspnea  diaphoresis  and feelings of impending doom.  Diagnostic Assessment: Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 175/100 mmHg in his right arm and 155/95 mmHg in his left arm  and a heart rate of 95 beats/min. Aortic regurgitation murmur was audible and pulses were asymmetrical. ECG showed findings suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of myocardial infarction. Immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was conducted that revealed a dissection flap in the ascending aorta with complications mimicking aortic valve insufficiency. Lab results were within normal limits except for mildly elevated D-dimer and Troponin I levels. The definitive diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection (Stanford system) was confirmed by a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Emergency surgical repair was decided for the patient by cardiovascular surgery. He underwent successful Bentall procedure (replacement of aortic valve and ascending aorta with reimplantation of coronary arteries into the graft)  and the operation was uneventful.  Follow up and Outcome: His postoperative period witnessed a slow but sustained recovery. During his visit six weeks post-operation  he was in good health with controlled blood pressure. His medication regimen included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. He was referred to cardiac rehabilitation and was advised about lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation  dietary adjustments  regular exercise).  Patient Perspective: The patient was initially alarmed with the sudden onset of discomfort and the necessity of immediate surgery for survival. But  the successful recovery from the surgery and the considerable alleviation of symptoms eased his distress. He has expressed readiness to commit to the advised lifestyle changes to improve his health.  Teaching points: This case highlights the fact that a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection is crucial in hypertensive patients presenting with sudden  severe  and tearing chest or back pain. Rapid diagnosis with immediate surgery can significantly improve the prognosis. Patient education on lifestyle modifications is crucial  especially in older males who smoke and have hypertension.

Aortic Dissection,7,68,"Title: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female with Hypertension: A Case Report and Literature Review   PC: Patient Confidentiality  Introduction:  This case report outlines a middle-aged Hispanic female's encounter with aortic dissection  increasing awareness about this condition and its symptoms to enable early diagnosis and intervention.  Case Details:  The patient  a 55-year-old Hispanic woman  presented to the emergency room with severe  abrupt onset of interscapular back pain that she described as """"tearing"""". The pain was associated with shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. She had a history of hypertension and was non-compliant with her antihypertensive medications.  The patient's past medical history besides hypertension was included with controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Obesity  and the occasional use of tobacco and alcohol. She had no known allergies or familial history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father had diabetes  and her mother died of breast cancer.  Upon physical examination  the patient was hypertensive with a blood pressure of 180/110 mm Hg  the heart rate was 88 beats per minute  respiration was 22 breaths per minute. No significant peripheral pulse difference was noted. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  The initial workup included an electrocardiogram  which showed non-specific ST-T wave changes but no evidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia. A rapid troponin test was negative. Given her history and presenting symptoms  the suspicion for aortic dissection was high  and therefore immediate imaging evaluation was performed.  A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection  involving the ascending aorta extending up to the origin of the right common carotid artery. The innominate artery  left common carotid artery  and left subclavian artery were not involved.  Immediate consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon was done  and the patient was prepared for emergency surgery. The successful surgery involved aortic valve resuspension  ascending aorta  and hemiarch replacement with hypothermic circulatory arrest.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening condition. The presented case highlights the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in patients presenting with 'tearing' back pain in association with hypertension.  This case further emphasizes respecting patient characteristics such as age  ethnicity  and gender while managing such critical conditions. Research demonstrates aortic dissection is more common in men  Caucasians  and older patients.  Conclusion:  Despite typical demographic trends suggesting lower predisposition  clinicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for aortic dissection in middle-aged Hispanic women presenting with severe back pain and hypertension. Early detection and prompt surgical intervention significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. "
Aortic Dissection,7,69,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Post-Menopausal Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  An aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aortic wall. This report describes the case of a post-menopausal woman who was diagnosed and treated for this disorder.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her back. The pain was described as a sharp  tearing sensation. The patient reported a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which were controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). She was a non-smoker and reported moderate alcohol use. Her family history revealed cardiovascular disease  specifically her father experienced an aortic aneurysm at the age of 74.  On examination  her blood pressure was noticeably different in both arms and her pulse was irregular. Her heart sounds were muffled on auscultation  with no audible murmur. Neurological examination findings were within normal limits.  A chest X-ray indicated an abnormal mediastinal shadow  prompting further investigation. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the presence of a Type B aortic dissection starting from the descending aorta and extending up to the iliac arteries. Mild aortic regurgitation was also noted on the subsequent TTE (trans-thoracic echocardiogram).  Management:  The patient was admitted to the ICU and commenced on aggressive blood pressure control using a continuous Nicardipine infusion  with a target systolic BP of less than 120 mmHg. The patient was also started on oral beta-blockers (Metoprolol) to reduce the sheer force on the dissection. Given the absence of malperfusion syndrome and the location of the dissection  the patient was managed conservatively in accordance with the current American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient’s chest pain resolved within the next 24 hours and she remained stable throughout the duration of her stay in the hospital. A follow-up CTA after 7 days showed no progression of the dissection. On outpatient follow-up 1 month later  the patient was asymptomatic  with well-controlled blood pressure levels.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion for aortic dissection in post-menopausal women presenting with sudden  severe chest pain  even in the absence of risk factors such as smoking and diabetes. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to positive patient outcomes in aortic dissection cases  as shown by our patient’s successful recovery.  Conclusion:  Despite the rarity of aortic dissection in the general population  physicians must consider this critical diagnosis in post-menopausal women with acute chest pain  particularly those with a history of hypertension. Early detection and immediate intervention can significantly improve clinical outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,7,70,Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male  Patient Profile  The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male presenting with acute chest pain and discomfort  profuse sweating  altered mental status  and difficulty breathing  which began suddenly approximately 2 hours before admission.  Past Medical History  The past medical history of the patient is significant with instances of untreated systemic hypertension  smoking  and dyslipidemia. The patient occasionally consumes alcoholic beverages but denies substance misuse. He has no known drug allergies and is currently not on any medications. The patient has no familial history of cardiovascular diseases but has lost both parents due to cancer-related illnesses.   Clinical Presentation  On admission  the patient was confused with a slightly slurred speech. Vital signs highlighted a blood pressure of 205/120 mmHg  a pulse of 110 beats/min  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  and an O2 saturation of 90% on room air. Remarkably  there was a blood pressure difference between the right and left arm (>20mmHg).  An immediate Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no evidence of ST-segment changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. However  due to the patient's presentation and high index of suspicion  aortic dissection was considered.  Diagnostic Assessment  An urgent Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) was ordered  which revealed a dissection starting at the ascending aorta  extending into the aortic arch and down the descending aorta  thus confirming the diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection.   Treatment and Outcome  The patient was immediately taken to the cardiothoracic surgical unit for emergency surgery. The procedure entailed a successful aortic root and ascending aorta replacement using a Dacron graft. The post-operative course was challenging due to complications involving acute renal failure and neurological deficits. The patient received further treatment in the intensive care unit with dialysis assistance and physiotherapy.  After a lengthy hospital stay  the patient has shown significant improvement in functional capacity. He continues to follow up with his cardiologist and primary care doctor regularly. The patient has also committed to making necessary lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation  maintaining a healthier diet and regular exercise to manage his blood pressure and overall health.  Discussion  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and swift diagnosis of aortic dissection  particularly in individuals presenting with acute chest pain and a history of hypertension. The atypical presentation of altered mental status in a setting of acute aortic dissection is  however  less encountered  thus emphasizing the importance of a high index of suspicion in such cases. Consistent follow-up and lifestyle modifications are vital for the management and prevention of recurrence post-surgery.  Compliance with ethical standards: The patient has given his informed consent for the case report to be published. His personal identifiers have been completely removed from this case report.

The pain started while he was performing routine activities at home. The pain was described as sharp and tearing  rating a 10 on a pain scale of 1 to 10. Mr. X also had profuse sweating and mild shortness of breath. On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be elevated with a reading of 190/100 mmHg  and he was in obvious distress.   Medical History:  Mr. X is known to have chronic hypertension for the past 10 years under irregular medication compliance  mainly due to his skepticism about long-term drug use. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago under diet control. Apart from these  he was a smoker and was reported to have smoked for 40 years  with an average of one pack per day. He denied any history of illicit drug use. There was no family history of aortic dissection or early cardiac death. He had no known drug allergies.   Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmur  rub  or gallop. Significant blood pressure differences were noted between the upper extremities. Neurological examination was remarkable for mild confusion but no focal neurological deficits.  Investigations:  An urgent ECG was done and showed no signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction. A subsequent emergent contrast-enhanced chest CT scan revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection.   Treatment:  Emergent surgical consultation was requested  and the patient was swiftly taken for surgical repair. The surgery successfully repaired the aortic dissection with a composite graft. Following surgery  the patient was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.   Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient showed remarkable improvement post-operatively and his pain considerably alleviated. He remained hemodynamically stable and was stepped down to the ward after 24 hours of ICU stay. Mr. X was discharged after ten days in good clinical condition  with instructions on strict blood pressure control  cessation of smoking  and lifestyle modification. He was advised to have regular follow-ups for blood pressure monitoring and medications.   This case serves as a typical manifestation of aortic dissection amongst the geriatric population with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. It emphasizes the importance of early recognition and management for better patient outcomes. Also  it underscores the need for regular follow-up and compliance with anti-hypertensive medications to prevent such catastrophic situations.
Aortic Dissection,7,74,Title: A Case Report on Stanford Type B Aortic Dissection in a 60-year-old Male with Uncontrolled Hypertension  Case Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male presented at our emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain that radiated to the back. The pain was described as sharp and tearing. The patient also reported feeling mild dizziness and shortness of breath. His family history indicated that his father had a myocardial infarction at an early age (47 years old).  Past Medical History:  The patient had a known history of chronic hypertension for the last 15 years  which was poorly controlled despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications including beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. He had also been diagnosed with type II diabetes about 10 years prior and was on metformin. His most recent HbA1c was reported as 7%. He had a 35-pack-a-year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He reported occasional alcohol consumption and no illicit drug use.  Hospital Course:  Upon admission  electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were nonspecific without evidence of ST-segment changes or Q-wave formations. The initial laboratory findings were normal  including cardiac enzymes. However  bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) raised the suspicion of aortic dissection showing dilated aortic root.   Subsequently  a computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford Type B aortic dissection involving the descending thoracic aorta extending distally into the abdominal aorta.  Treatment & Follow-Up:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac ICU and managed conservatively. Blood pressure control was optimized with intravenous anti-hypertensive therapy including labetalol. Follow-up imaging after a week showed no progression of the dissection.  His blood glucose levels were controlled with stricter dietary regulations and insulin therapy. He was also counseled about the importance of strict blood pressure control  regular follow-ups  and lifestyle modifications  including dietary changes  adequate physical activity  and stress management.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection  although a rare condition  has a high fatality rate  making early diagnosis and management crucial. Hypertension remains the most significant predisposing factor. As seen in this case  features of aortic dissection may be ambiguous  but a high level of suspicion should be maintained in patients with high-risk factors such as poorly managed hypertension  history of smoking  and family history of aortic disease or early-onset coronary artery disease. Proper control of blood pressure and diabetes  cessation of smoking  and lifestyle modifications are key to reducing the risk and progression of aortic dissection.  Learning Points:  This case underscores the importance of: 1. Maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest or back pain  particularly with a known history of hypertension. 2. The critical role of preventive measures such as strictly controlled blood pressure and blood sugar  cessation of smoking  regular cardiac screening  and lifestyle modifications for at-risk patients. 3. That while ECG findings may be nonspecific for aortic dissection  echocardiography and CTA are key tools in diagnosing this condition.
Aortic Dissection,7,75,Title: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-aged Obese Male: A Case Report  Patient Information: A 52-year-old African American male  a resident of New York City  was presented to the emergency department. The patient was an active smoker with a pack-a-day habit for the past 30 years and was classified as obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.3 kg/m². The patient was employed as a warehouse supervisor and was living with his wife and two children.  Chief Complaints: The patient reported experiencing severe chest pain of acute onset that started around 4 hours prior to the presentation. The pain was sudden  tearing  and radiating to the back.  Medical History: The patient had a history of uncontrolled hypertension for which he was taking medication irregularly due to lack of health insurance and forgetfulness. There was no prior history of diabetes  renal disease  or any surgical intervention. However  the patient had an uncle who suffered a myocardial infarction at an early age of 45. The patient's routine activities were limited due to his morbid obesity and he had poor dietary habits with negligible physical exercise.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  he was found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 185/110 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. His respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. Left pupil was slightly dilated as compared to the right  indicating a possible Horner syndrome.  Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) visualized aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta. CT angiogram depicted a type A aortic dissection confirming the diagnosis. The lab results showed elevated D-Dimer levels well over the standard threshold.  Therapeutic Intervention: Emergent surgical intervention was planned and the patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery unit. Surgery was successful and antihypertensive medication was aggressively managed to control blood pressure post-operatively.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was enrolled in the cardiac rehabilitation program and referred for nutritional counseling to manage obesity. The patient was also urged to quit smoking. During follow-ups  he was consistent with medications  with blood pressure maintained under control. There was no recurrence of aortic dissection during 1-year of follow-up.  Patient Perspective: The patient admitted that he had been negligent in managing his hypertension  and this incident served as a wake-up call. He was determined to adopt healthier lifestyle changes and committed to regular follow-ups.  Informed Consent: Verbal informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case in anonymity.  Teaching Points/Discussion: This case highlights the importance of effectively managing chronic diseases such as hypertension and obesity  given their potential to precipitate severe cardiovascular conditions like aortic dissection  especially when combined with other life-threatening behaviors such as smoking. 
Aortic Dissection,7,76,"Title: Acute Type B Aortic Dissection in a 60-Year-Old African-American Woman with a History of Hypertension  Case Report: The patient is a 60-year-old African-American female  residing in the urban area of Houston  Texas. She is of average build  does not smoke  and has no previous history of illicit drug or alcohol use. She works as a school teacher and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle. Her family history is significant for hypertension in both her parents and a maternal aunt  but no known genetic disorders or predispositions have been identified.  The patient has been under treatment for arterial hypertension for 15 years  which has remained nearly well-controlled with medication (losartan 50 mg once daily). However  she has been non-compliant with diet regimen and physical activity often. She has no history of diabetes  myocardial infarction  connective tissue diseases  or significant allergies. Her only surgery was a hysterectomy 10 years ago due to uterine fibroids  with no noted post-op complications.  The patient was rushed to the hospital after experiencing an abrupt onset of severe chest and back pain that was described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" that radiated to her lower back. The pain started while she was resting at home and was not related to any physical exertion. Associated symptoms included dizziness  nausea  and profuse sweating. No loss of consciousness was noted.   In the emergency department  her vital signs were found to be unstable  with a blood pressure of 185/120 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110 bpm  and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was at 94% with room air. Physical examination was significant for a difference in blood pressure between her arms  orthostatic hypotension  and a palpable abdominal mass.  Initial lab results revealed slight leukocytosis and an elevated D-dimer. The EKG showed non-specific ST changes but no definitive evidence of myocardial ischemia. Urgent transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated ascending aorta  triggering an immediate radiology consult. A subsequent CT angiogram of the thorax and abdomen revealed an intimal flap in the descending aorta  establishing the diagnosis of Stanford Type B aortic dissection.  Emergency surgery was planned; however  due to her clinical instability  she was first medically managed with aggressive blood pressure control using intravenous beta-blockers (labetalol) and a nitroprusside drip under ICU observation.     For this case  the patient's hypertension  age  race  and genetics likely contributed to the occurrence of the aortic dissection. Her non-compliance with lifestyle modifications further precipitated this catastrophic event. Proper education regarding lifestyle modifications  compliance with medication  and regular follow-up are key components in handling patients with chronic illnesses such as hypertension.   In light of this case  it is crucial to maintain a high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in hypertensive patients presenting with atypical chest or abdominal pain. While this condition is relatively rare  early diagnosis and treatment greatly improve the prognosis and decrease mortality rates."
Aortic Dissection,7,77,Title: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient with a History of Unmanaged Hypertension  Abstract: Aortic dissection is a rare condition  often associated with a high mortality rate if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The condition is marked by an intimal tear  developing into two lumens. The patient's age  gender  and history of hypertension can contribute to the development of the disorder. This case report involves a 73-year-old male patient who presented with chest pain and was subsequently diagnosed with aortic dissection.  Case Presentation: A 73-year-old Asian male presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started within the last six hours. The chest pain  as described by the patient  was acute in onset  tearing in nature  and radiating to the back. Over the past year  he was also suffering from fatigue  occasional dizziness  and had a consistent problem of unmanaged hypertension for the past 10 years. He had a known history of smoking for the past 50 years with a cumulative total of 40 pack-years but no history of illicit drug use. The patient was currently on alpha-2 receptor agonists for his hypertension but admitted irregular intake due to personal negligence.  His physical examination revealed blood pressure readings differing in both upper limbs (right arm: 170/95 mm Hg  left arm: 148/90 mm Hg). Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur. Electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes  but no obvious signs of myocardial infarction.   The attending physician ordered a computed tomography (CT) angiogram  doing so on suspicion of aortic dissection. The CT results confirmed the suspicion  revealing a Stanford type B aortic dissection commencing after the left subclavian artery and extending to the renal arteries.  Treatment and Outcome: Following the diagnosis  the patient was hospitalized and started on intravenous esmolol for immediate blood pressure control. An interdisciplinary team involving a cardiologist  cardiac surgeon  and anesthesiologist made the decision for conservative management due to the patient's old age and multiple comorbidities. The patient was monitored closely with strict blood pressure control  aiming for systolic blood pressure between 100-120 mm Hg.   During his stay  a regular follow-up CT scan revealed the stabilization of the dissection. After two weeks  the patient was discharged with instructions for regular outpatient follow-ups and a strict medication regimen aimed at controlling his blood pressure at a stringent level to prevent the progression of dissection. On 6-month follow-up  the patient's blood pressure was under control  and he reported significant relief from his initial symptoms and discomfort.  Conclusion: This case reiterates the importance of hypertension management in preventing major cardiovascular complications like aortic dissection. Physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for aortic dissection in older patients with unmanaged hypertension  presenting with chest pain and asymmetrical blood pressure. Multidisciplinary management aimed at blood pressure control can lead to favorable outcomes in patients not suitable for surgery.
Aortic Dissection,7,78,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Male with Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Report  Abstract: We report a case of a 57-year-old male who presented with acute chest pain associated with hypotension and was later diagnosed with aortic dissection. This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and management in patients suspected of having aortic dissection  particularly  those with risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension.  Case Presentation: Mr X is a 57-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back. The pain onset was sudden  while the patient was at rest. He had no significant family history of cardiovascular disease.   Clinical Findings: On presentation  he was in evident distress  pale  diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg  and a pulse rate of 110 bpm. The cardiovascular examination was significant for a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. His lung fields were clear  and other physical examinations were otherwise unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) was initially performed which did not reveal any definitive abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed a dissection of the ascending  arch  and descending aorta  consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially managed with intravenous beta-blockers to control heart rate followed by vasodilators to maintain his blood pressure  with an aim of systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg. Emergent surgical consultation was sought. The patient underwent successful emergency aortic root  and ascending aortic replacement with an aortic valve-sparing technique.  Outcome: The patient's post-operative course was complicated by transient renal insufficiency  which improved with conservative management. He was discharged on postoperative day 8 with instructions for aggressive blood pressure control. At his follow-up visit a month later  he was doing well  with well-controlled blood pressure on medication.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the challenging diagnosis of aortic dissection with its varied presentation  in patients with risk factors such as hypertension. Prompt diagnosis using CT angiography and an aggressive surgical approach resulted in a successful patient outcome in this case.

Aortic Dissection,7,79,Title: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Female Patient with a History of Hypertension  Abstract: The following case report discusses the presentation  diagnosis  and management of aortic dissection in a 72-year-old African American woman  who presented with sudden back pain. It underscores the importance of early recognition and intervention in aortic dissection to prevent severe morbidity  with a focus on the potential risk factors including age  gender  ethnicity  and the history of hypertension.  Case Report: A 72-year-old African American female patient presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden intense back pain. Her past medical history was significant for uncontrolled hypertension  which she had managed with Lisinopril for a decade. She denied having any known allergies or substance use including tobacco  alcohol  or illicit substances.  On physical exam  her vitals were as follows: blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg  heart rate was at 100 beats per minute  body temperature was 37.5 degrees Celsius and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  with oxygen saturation on room air at 98%. The patient had significant diaphoresis and appeared anxious. Her pain was radiating to the abdomen.  An ECG revealed unspecific ST changes  but troponin levels were within normal limits reducing the likelihood of an acute myocardial infarction. Given the patient's high-risk profile - advanced age  uncontrolled hypertension  and her symptoms - CT angiography of the chest abdomen and pelvis was performed. Imaging results confirmed the presence of a Stanford type B aortic dissection.  She was immediately started on beta-blockers intravenously to manage her blood pressure. She was referred to the vascular surgery department for possible endovascular therapy but was deemed unfit due to her advanced age and comorbidities.  The patient was managed medically with aggressive control of blood pressure and symptomatic care. Unfortunately  within a couple of days  the patient's condition worsened  resulting in multi-organ failure leading to death. This case demonstrates the high mortality risk associated with aortic dissection  particularly in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapeutic interventions.  Discussion and Conclusion: Acute aortic dissection remains a widely recognized but infrequently encountered condition  often carrying grim prognoses. Advanced age  hypertension  and African American ethnicity have all been associated with an increased risk for aortic dissection in literature. Thus  high clinical suspicion and timely aggressive management play a pivotal role in the management of such patients. This case accentuates the need for more research to improve the understanding and management of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,7,80,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in A Middle-Aged Hispanic Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection presents an emergent clinical situation with high mortality rates. This case report discusses a Hispanic male patient who presented with symptoms leading to the diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Case Presentation: A 67-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with severe back and abdominal pain radiating to his chest. The patient further described the pain as 'tearing' and 'ripping' that began abruptly earlier in the day. His past medical history was marked by hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with atenolol and statins respectively. The patient's father reportedly died in his early 70s due to aortic dissection. He did not have history of smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use  reported no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife  retired  and his activity levels were modest.  Clinical examination showed an alert and oriented patient with visibly acute distress. The patient's blood pressure was elevated (175/110 mmHg) and pulse was regular at 80 bpm. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal S1 and S2 sounds  no murmur or rub  jugular venous pressure was not raised  bilateral peripheral pulses were equally palpable and no signs of peripheral edema. Lungs were clear on auscultation. Abdomen was soft with no palpable mass or tenderness.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given his serious symptoms  high blood pressure  and family history  the emergency physician considered aortic dissection as a differential diagnosis. An immediate CT angiogram showed an intimal flap in the descending aorta  consistent with Stanford type B aortic dissection. His lab work  including complete blood count  renal function  lipids  and troponin levels  revealed no abnormal values.  Therapeutic intervention: As the patient was hemodynamically stable  he was primarily managed with an intensive antihypertensive regimen to control shear stress. His previous medications were continued and intravenous labetalol was added to reduce his blood pressure to the target range. He was later transferred to a specialized cardiology center for further management including catheter-based or surgical interventions.  Outcome: The patient's condition was controlled and kept under observation. Coronary angiography did not reveal any significant lesions and he was managed conservatively with optimal medical therapy and periodic surveillance.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion in diagnosing aortic dissection  especially in patients with characteristic symptomatology  elevated blood pressure  and relevant family history. It also emphasizes the inevitability of prompt imaging and appropriate medical intervention to prevent fatal complications.

Aortic Dissection,7,81,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 57-Year Old Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a severe condition which is associated with high mortality rates. This case focuses on a 57-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for hypertension and tobacco use.  Patient Presentation: The patient  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  with an occupational history as a high school teacher  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest and back pain radiating to his hips. The patient described the pain as 'tearing'. His blood pressure was significantly different between arms  with his right arm reading 180/95 mmHg and the left 150/80 mmHg. The patient also had mild temporal and spatial disorientation during the examination.  Past Medical History: His past medical history was significant for uncontrolled hypertension for 20 years  30 pack-years of smoking  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He was on Losartan for blood pressure management and had no known allergies.  Clinical Findings: Physical exam revealed a diastolic murmur. His ECG showed no signs of ischemia or infarction while his chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum. An immediate computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection. Laboratory results including complete blood count  kidney and liver function tests were within normal range.  Treatment: The cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted and the patient was rapidly taken to the operating room for an emergency ascending aorta replacement due to the impending risk of rupture or tamponade. The operation was successful  and the patient was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Outcome: Postoperatively  the patient made a steady recovery. He was moved from the ICU to a step-down unit on postoperative day 3  and finally discharged home on postoperative day 10. The patient was prescribed beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control his blood pressure and was strongly advised to quit smoking.   Discussion: This case underscores the need for immediate recognition and management of aortic dissection in under an hour (golden hour concept). Ending his smoking habit and maintaining low blood pressure are crucial for this patient in order to avoid further vascular damage.  Conclusion: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening vascular emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and management. High index of suspicion and early imaging are keys to reducing mortality.

Aortic Dissection,7,82,Title: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection with Positive Outcomes in a 65-Year-Old Male Patient   Patient Presentation:   The patient  Mr. X  a 65-year-old African-American male with a previous medical history of hypertension and smoking  presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden chest pain radiating to the back. The severe pain started abruptly  was described as ripping or tearing  and increased with intensity over time. Mr. X also reported shortness of breath along with the bout of chest pain. He denied any history of trauma or drug misuse. The pain was not associated with food intake  exercise  or any usual triggers for angina. Mr. X’s family history included his father having died from a myocardial infarction at age 50.   Investigations:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) was immediately performed  which showed a left bundle branch block that had not been seen on antecedent ECGs. Chest x-ray did not show any mediastinal widening or signs of congestive heart failure. Given the patient’s symptoms and newly discovered left bundle branch block on ECG  the patient was suspected to have an aortic dissection. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed an ascending aortic dissection (Stanford Type A dissection) that commenced just above the aortic valve and extended into the descending aorta.   Management and Outcome:  The patient was emergently transferred to the operating room where emergency cardiothoracic surgery was performed  including ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft. The patient was placed on antihypertensive medication and transferred to the intensive care unit post-operatively. During the hospital stay  the patient's blood pressure was closely monitored and kept within a strict range to prevent further dissection. The patient was discharged after a two-week postoperative period with no complications. Upon discharge  the patient was instructed to cease all use of tobacco products and was referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program and continued his antihypertensive medication. Follow-up CT scans showed no further complications or extension of the dissection and the patient reported a significant reduction in chest pain.   Conclusion:  This case report highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis in patients who present with sudden  severe chest pain  especially when risk factors  such as hypertension and smoking  exist. It demonstrates that timely diagnosis and aggressive surgical management in combination with appropriate post-operative care can lead to a successful outcome in aortic dissection patients who often have a poor prognosis.
Aortic Dissection,7,83,"**Title:** Acute Aortic Dissection in a Patient with Prevalent Hypertension: A Case Report  **Patient Information**: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. His main occupation was as a truck driver before retiring. He is a current smoker with a 35 pack-year smoking history.  **Chief Complaints**: The patient presented to the emergency department with an abrupt onset of severe chest and back pain  which he described as """"tearing"""". The pain peaked within seconds of onset and radiated to the back in a downward trajectory. Accompanying the pain  the patient reported symptoms of dizziness and shortness of breath.  **Past Medical History**: The patient has a documented history of systemic hypertension for which he was prescribed Losartan 50mg daily. Unfortunately  due to financial constraints and a lack of regular follow-up  the patient was non-compliant with the medication and often had blood pressure measurements in the pre-hypertensive to stage 1 hypertension range. He had no known allergies  no previous surgeries  no history of any heart diseases  and no known familial history of any genetic or inherited disorders. He has never been diagnosed with Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes  and presents no features suggestive of these conditions.  **Physical Examination**: At presentation  his vital signs were noted to be: blood pressure of 180/110mmHg  heart rate of 100 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no audible murmurs. Pulmonary examination was unremarkable with no audible adventitious sounds. The rest of the examination was unremarkable save for distress evident from facial expression and body posture.  **Relevant Investigations**: An urgent CT angiogram revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  characteristic of a type A aortic dissection. Echocardiography confirmed presence of aortic dissection and revealed mild aortic insufficiency  but without compromise of cardiac function or other valvular dysfunction. Laboratory analysis was largely unremarkable  apart from modestly elevated D-dimer levels.  **Diagnosis and Counseling**: The patient was diagnosed with an acute type A aortic dissection  likely precipitated by his poorly controlled hypertension.  **Management and Follow-up**: Due to the risk of potentially fatal complications  the patient was immediately transferred to a tertiary care center where prompt surgical intervention was undertaken. At one-month post-surgery follow-up  the patient was in good health and was being successfully managed on anti-hypertensive medication. He was advised on the importance of adherence to his therapy  and his need for regular monitoring given his elevated risk for recurrent aortic dissection.  **Conclusions**: This case underscores the potential severity of poorly managed hypertension  and the importance of early detection and intervention in aortic dissection cases.  **Patient Consent**: Obtained.  **Provenance and Peer Review**: Not commissioned  externally peer-reviewed."
Aortic Dissection,7,84,Title: A Peculiar Case of Acute Aortic Dissection in a 67-Year-Old Female Patient  Introduction: We present a case of a 67-year-old Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with acute aortic dissection (AAD). This case stands as an interesting representation due to her age and gender. Her past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Patient Information: The patient  Mrs. A  is a retired teacher who lives with her husband in a suburban area. Mrs. A has a history of hypertension  maintained on antihypertensive medications  and hyperlipidemia  controlled by statins. She is a nonsmoker and non-alcoholic. She has no family history of cardiovascular diseases.   History of Present Illness: Mrs. A presented to the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain that started a few hours before her visit. She described a tearing sensation on the left side of her chest  radiating to her back  along with a feeling of impending doom. She denied any symptoms of breathlessness  loss of consciousness  or neurological symptoms.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient's blood pressure was found to be markedly different between the right and left arm  with a higher reading in the right arm (150/90mmHg) compared to the left arm (120/80mmHg). Her heart rate was 100 beats per minute  with regular rhythm and no murmurs. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender; there was no neurological deficit.  Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern but no acute ST-T changes. A chest X-ray was normal  but given the suspicion of aortic dissection  a computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) was performed which confirmed the presence of a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.  Therapeutic Interventions: The patient was promptly started on intravenous labetalol to control hypertension and heart rate. Surgical consultation was immediately sought  and she was taken for an emergency open aortic repair.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The surgery was successful without complications  and the postoperative period was uneventful. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 10. During the 6-months follow-up  she showed no signs of recurrence.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of high clinical suspicion for acute aortic dissection  especially in hypertensive patients presenting with severe chest pain. It also emphasizes the age and gender variability of aortic dissection patients. Immediate diagnosis by imaging such as a CTA can ensure early intervention and good patient outcomes. 
Aortic Dissection,7,85,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 64-year-old Male with a History of Uncontrolled Hypertension and Chronic Smoking: A Case Report  Patient Presentation: A 64-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with severe  abrupt onset of chest pain radiating to the back. The patient described the pain as “tearing” in nature. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 30-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily.   History and Physical Examination: Upon presentation  his blood pressure was found to be 180/120 mmHg. Assymetric blood pressure was noted with a 20 mmHg difference between the arms. His pulse was 102 beats per minute and respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute. Upon further questioning  the patient mentioned that his hypertension is poorly controlled and he has not been compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive drugs due to affordability challenges. His last physical check-up was five years ago and he denied any previous episodes of similar chest pain.   Apart from a systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space  physical examination revealed no other significant findings. His Body Mass Index (BMI) was noted to be 26  placing him in the overweight category.  Investigations and Diagnosis: An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed immediately which did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia. Given the symptom profile and history of uncontrolled hypertension  a suspicion of aortic dissection was raised. This was confirmed via Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)  which revealed a dissection of the ascending aorta  classified as a Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Management and Follow-up: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower the blood pressure and heart rate. He underwent emergent surgical intervention for repair of the dissection. His post-operative recovery was unremarkable and he was referred to a cardiologist for tight blood pressure control and smoking cessation education.  In his follow-up visits  there was noted compliance to his antihypertensive medications and the patient had made efforts towards smoking cessation. Cardiac rehabilitation was recommended.  Discussion: This case underscores the importance of maintaining adequate blood pressure control  especially in high-risk patients  to help prevent catastrophic conditions like aortic dissection. Smoking  being a prominent risk factor for aortic dissection  needs to be controlled and cessation should be advised and facilitated. The patient's delay in reaching out to healthcare due to affordability issues raises concerns about the need for accessible healthcare programs to manage chronic diseases effectively.  Patient's Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the study and the publication of this case report.
Aortic Dissection,7,86,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Hispanic Male: A Case Report  Abstract: We report a case of acute aortic dissection in a 65-year-old Hispanic male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension. The patient presented with severe chest pain radiating to the back along with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath.  Case Report: The patient  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  demographic of which is stated to have an increased predisposition to hypertension  arrived at the emergency room complaining of sudden severe chest pain  a sensation he described as “ripping” that had started a few hours ago and was radiating to the back. The pain was associated with severe shortness of breath.  The patient was a known case of hypertension for the past 15 years. Despite this  he exhibited poor adherence to his antihypertensive medication regime and often missed medical appointments  leading to uncontrolled hypertension. He had no known allergies but had a 30-pack-year history of smoking. The patient also reported a moderate intake of alcohol. There was no significant family history.  On examination  blood pressure was significantly different in both arms (180/110 mmHg on right; 150/90 mmHg on left)  a classic sign suggestive of aortic dissection  and a weak pulse was felt in the left arm. Heart sounds were normal  but faint diastolic murmur was discernible on exam.  Investigation: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) was done  which showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. Laboratory investigations  including Complete Blood Count  Renal function tests  Electrolyte Panel  and Troponin levels  were within normal limits.  Imaging:  An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered  which revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the brachiocephalic artery.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aggressive antihypertensive therapy (intravenous Labetalol) to lower the blood pressure and heart rate in an attempt to decrease aortic wall stress. Following this  cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for emergency surgical repair.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of maintaining good blood pressure control in hypertensive patients to prevent disastrous complications such as aortic dissection. It also highlights the need for an immediate diagnostic approach utilizing CTA in patients with high suspicion for aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,7,87,"Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 63-Year-old Female: A Case Report  Background: Aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening condition usually affecting males between 60 to 80 years  characterized by the separation of the layers within the aortic wall. It has an estimated annual incidence of 3 cases per 100 000. Notwithstanding its predilection for males  when it occurs in females  it carries higher morbidity and mortality rates.  Case presentation: A 63-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe central chest pain radiating to the back. It started while at rest and persistently increased over time. The patient described it as """"tearing"""" and """"sharp"""". She denied experiencing shortness of breath  nausea  or palpitations.   The patient has an extensive past medical history  including controlled hypertension for the last 12 years  smoking (30 pack years)  and a family history of cardiovascular disease (her father had an aortic aneurysm). She had regular annual checkups but was not under any medication except antihypertensive drugs (Losartan 50 mg/day).  On examination  she was anxious  pale  and sweaty with a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg on the right arm and 165/90 mmHg on the left arm. There were no pulse deficits. Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 with no additional sounds or murmurs. Chest and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.  Initial EKG showed non-specific ST-segment changes but no definite signs of ischemia or infarction. Blood tests including full blood count  renal function  and cardiac markers were within normal limits. An urgent computed tomography (CT) aortogram revealed an intimal flap in the aortic arch and descending aorta consistent with Stanford type B aortic dissection.   The patient was immediately started on labetalol to control blood pressure and reduce shearing forces. She was admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and was later transferred to a tertiary hospital for endovascular therapy.  Conclusion: This case elaborates the challenges in diagnosing aortic dissection given its rare occurrence and non-specific presenting symptoms. It underscores the need for high clinical suspicion in high-risk patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially in hypertensive individuals with a history of smoking and a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease. Early diagnosis via imaging modalities such as CT aortogram is crucial in initiating prompt treatment which  in this case  proved to be life-saving. "

The patient described the pain as “tearing” or “ripping” in nature. Mr. J also reported feeling lightheaded but denied any loss of consciousness. His medical history was significant for hypertension and a 30-year smoking history.  Background: Mr. J is a construction worker and has a body mass index (BMI) of 29. His family history is noncontributory. He has been managing his hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day and lisinopril 10 mg/day. However  his blood pressure (BP) control has been erratic with noncompliance to antihypertensive therapy and routine checkups. Mr. J is a heavy drinker and smokes approximately 20 cigarettes a day.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  his blood pressure was 210/120 mm Hg in the right arm  and 190/110 mm Hg in the left arm  a differential BP considered significant and suggestive of aortic dissection. His pulse was 98 beats per minute  and he appeared in acute distress. A heart murmur suggesting aortic regurgitation was noted and pulses were faint in both lower limbs. Electrocardiography showed signs of left ventricular strain but no myocardial ischemia. Chest X-ray (CXR) indicated an abnormal mediastinal silhouette with an enlarged aortic knob.   Diagnosis  Treatment  and Outcome: At this point  clinical suspicion was high for aortic dissection. A CT aortography was performed promptly  confirming Type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the descending aorta. The patient was immediately administered intravenous labetalol to control hypertension.   Mr.J was promptly referred to cardiovascular surgery. He underwent successful ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with re-implantation of the coronary arteries consistent with the Bentall procedure. His postoperative course was uneventful  and he was discharged on postoperative day 12.   Conclusion: This case underscores the critical importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection in hypertensive patients with a significant smoking history. Early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention are crucial to improve survival in patients with Type A aortic dissection.  Follow-Up: Mr. J was counseled about cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol intake. He has been asked to maintain regular follow-ups for monitoring his BP and adjust antihypertensive drugs as required. He has been enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve his cardiovascular fitness. His participation and commitment to these lifestyle changes will play a significant role in preventing re-dissection or other cardiovascular complications. 
Aortic Dissection,7,89,"Title: A Case of Aortic Discretion in a 66-Year-Old Male with a History of Hypertension and Smoking  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a serious condition where a tear in the inner layer of the aorta allows blood to flow into the walls  which can lead to aortic rupture  organ damage  and death. It is commonly associated with hypertension and other heart conditions.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain described as """"tearing"""" that radiated to the back. The patient appears to be in distressed condition and complaints of shortness of breath. The pain commenced while he was at rest. His past medical history is notable for treated hypertension  and he has been a smoker for over 40 years. His family history includes cardiovascular disease - his father died of a myocardial infarction in his late 60s. There is no known family history of connective tissue disorder.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination upon admission revealed hypertension  with blood pressure at 169/103 mmHg  and a pulse rate of 108 beats per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed a difference in pulse and blood pressure between the right and left limb. No abnormal heart sounds were noted. The intimal flap on transthoracic echocardiogram suggested the presence of aortic dissection.  Diagnostic Assessment: Further testing with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta and descending aorta. Blood tests revealed raised D-dimer levels. Renal function tests showed elevated creatinine and BUN levels  suggesting renal involvement.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the presence of a type A aortic dissection and the patient's worsening condition  emergency surgical repair was deemed necessary. The patient underwent successful supracoronary ascending aorta replacement with aortic root and aortic valve preservation.  Follow Up and Outcomes: The patient’s immediate postoperative period was uneventful. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments  repeated CTA showed no signs of dissection recurrence and the patient reported relief from earlier symptoms. He was advised on strict blood pressure control and cessation of smoking to reduce risk of complications and recurrence.  Conclusion: This case represents the typical demographic for aortic dissection – older males with a history of hypertension and smoking. Prompt identification and surgical intervention remain critical in the management of aortic dissection for reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. Maintenance of systemic blood pressure within the desired limits and cessation of smoking are essential steps in the prevention of recurrence."

His condition was later diagnosed as aortic dissection (AD)  a serious cardiovascular condition that can often be fatal when not treated promptly.  Patient Information: Mr. C is a retired electrical engineer  residing in the midwestern United States. He had been living independently prior to the incident and had a history of smoking  with a pack-years history of 40 years. He mildly consumed alcohol occasionally but had no known drug abuse history.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of chronic hypertension  for which he was on Lisinopril 10mg daily. He did not have any previous major surgeries nor allergic reactions to medications. There were no records of hereditary diseases in the family  but a past history of cardiovascular disease in both his parents was noted.  Clinical Findings: On admission  his blood pressure was markedly different (asymmetrical) between his right and left arms; right arm blood pressure was 185/100 mm of Hg and left arm blood pressure was 155/90 mm of Hg. Mr. C had a regular pulse of 90 beats per minute and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. There was slight sweating and pallor noted. On auscultation  there was a variation in the intensity of heart sounds during respiratory cycle and there were no additional heart sounds or murmurs.  Diagnostic Assessment: A chest radiograph showed mild widening of mediastinum. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection originating just above the aortic root  involving the ascending aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent urgent surgical repair of the dissected aorta  which involved an aortic root replacement with a composite graft. Post-operative period was uneventful and his pain and dyspnea got resolved.  Follow-Up and Outcome: Mr. C was discharged home on postoperative day 14  with prescription of antihypertensive medications that include amlodipine 5mg daily and metoprolol 50mg twice a day. Follow-up at six weeks  three months  six months  and one-year postsurgery showed that the patient remained against hypertensive and there was no further progression of the dissection.  Patient Perspective: Mr. C expressed relief at his discharge and was grateful for the timely intervention that saved his life. He was appreciative of the care team and actively participated in his post-operative care.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early detection and surgical intervention in managing aortic dissection in aging individuals with risk factors such as hypertension and family history. Regular follow-ups are crucial to monitor the stability of the graft and ensure the patient maintains a healthy lifestyle to prevent recurrence or complications.

Aortic Dissection,7,92,Title: A Case Report on Aortic Dissection in a 63-year-old Caucasian Female  Introduction:  Presenting the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian female (Mrs. A) with aortic dissection.  Demographics:  The patient is a retired primary school teacher residing in suburban Maryland  USA. She is a widow  living alone. She is a non-smoker and reports rational alcohol consumption  without any records of substance abuse. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension in her father and stroke in her mother.  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  treated with Amlodipine 10mg daily and Rosuvastatin 10mg daily  respectively. She had never experienced any symptoms of heart disease until the present incidence. She has no known allergies  a history of mild osteoarthritis  and had undergone a cholecystectomy at the age of 50. She has been in compliance with medications  regular exercise and a balanced diet as advised by her primary care physician.  Current Presentation:  Mrs. A was brought into the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain that she described as radiating to her back. She reported the pain as starting while she was carrying groceries and progressively intensifying. She also reported slight shortness of breath but denied experiencing any other symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or dizziness. No weakness or numbness was reported on initial presentation.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Initial physical examination at the ED indicated elevated blood pressure (180/100 mmHg)  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and slight diaphoresis. No other significant findings were observed during the examination. An EKG was performed showing no signs of myocardial infarction. A subsequent chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum. Given the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings  a contrast CT scan was ordered that confirmed the presence of a Stanford type A aortic dissection  which necessitated immediate medical attention.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was rushed to the operating room for an emergency ascending aortic replacement  also known as a Bentall procedure. The surgery was successfully performed  and post-operative recovery was uneventful. After the stabilization of the patient's condition  she was transferred to the post-surgery ward for further care. Her blood pressure and other vital signs were regularly monitored  and they remained within normal limits throughout her hospital stay. The patient was discharged after ten days in stable condition with oral anticoagulants and advice for regular follow-up.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the high index of suspicion required to diagnose aortic dissections  given their similar presentation to more common conditions like myocardial infarction. Rapid identification and intervention can significantly improve the survival rate and prognosis of the patients suffering from this life-threatening condition.

He described the pain as a tearing sensation  and it began in the anterior chest before moving to his back. The patient also reported breathlessness  sweats  and dizziness. There was no associated nausea  vomiting  or syncope. He denied a family history of cardiovascular disorders.   Past Medical History:   Mr. J had a history of uncontrolled hypertension and was non-compliant with his medication  consisting of amlodipine 10mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily  due to financial constraints. There was no history of smoking or alcohol intake.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared in distress due to pain. His temperature was 37.1°C  blood pressure was 200/110 mmHg in the right arm and 180/100 mmHg in the left arm  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. Pulmonary examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal and neurological examination findings were non-significant. His body mass index (BMI) was within the normal range.  Investigation and Imaging:  Laboratory tests revealed a slightly elevated D-dimer at 0.55 µg/ml (normal range <0.5 µg/ml) and a mild increase in leukocyte count. All other laboratory parameters  including hemoglobin  platelets  coagulation profile  and electrolytes  were within the normal range. Electrocardiogram showed non-specific ST-T wave changes. Chest X-ray revealed mediastinal widening suggestive of possible aortic dissection.   A subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a Type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the proximal bilateral common iliac arteries. There was no evidence of aortic valve insufficiency or pericardial effusion.  Treatment and Follow Up:  The patient was initially managed with intravenous labetalol to control blood pressure to prevent further dissection. He was then referred for emergent surgical intervention. The postoperative course was uneventful with resolution of symptoms  and he was discharged on postoperative day 7 on oral antihypertensives  with regular follow up in the outpatient department.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and management of aortic dissection  a potentially life-threatening condition  especially in individuals with poorly controlled hypertension. It underscores the role of imaging in the diagnosis and timely surgical intervention in improving survival rates.

Aortic Dissection,7,94,Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-aged African-American Male  Patient Demographics:  Sex: Male Age: 56 years Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Accountant Marital Status: Married Health behaviors: Non-smoker  moderate drinker BMI: 27 (overweight)  Past Medical History:  Hypertension  successfully managed with medication over the last 10 years Late-onset Type-II Diabetes  diagnosed two years ago  managed with metformin History of mild hyperlipidaemia  controlled with statin therapy  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining about severe chest pain  which he described as 'tearing' and radiating to the back. The pain began suddenly while he was at work and was unlike anything he had experienced before. The severity of the pain brought about symptoms of nausea and profuse sweating. Recognizing that he could be having a cardiac event  his coworkers quickly facilitated an emergency medical response.  Investigations:  Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history of hypertension and diabetes  aortic dissection was considered as a potential diagnosis. An ECG was performed  which revealed no signs of myocardial infarction  but did show slight ST segment depression. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered  which showed a dilated ascending aorta and intimal flap  suggesting an aortic dissection.  Diagnosis:  The diagnosis of Stanford Type A Aortic dissection was confirmed by a subsequent CT angiography of the thorax and abdomen with contrast  which visualized a large intimal flap extending from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta.   Intervention:  The patient was admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery unit for emergency surgical intervention. An ascending hemiarch replacement with open stent graft placement was performed. Blood pressure was controlled using labetalol and nitroprusside infusion.  Outcome:  The patient tolerated the procedure well and showed significant improvement postoperatively. The six-week follow-up appointment revealed sustained blood pressure control  with no complications or further dissection on imaging.  Learning point:  This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in the diagnosis when encountering patients with a history of hypertension and acute onset chest pain. Early diagnosis may favorably impact the prognosis  as it enables timely surgical intervention  potentially reducing the high morbidity and mortality associated with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,7,95,Case Report: Type A Aortic Dissection in a 58-year-old Asian Male   Abstract: This report presents the case of an Asian male patient experiencing acute chest pains  which was later diagnosed as Type A Aortic Dissection. Such cases are comparatively rare  accounting for only 30% of cases of Aortic Dissections. The early use of imaging played a vital role in the diagnosis  prompting immediate surgery which saved the patient's life.  Patient Description:   Mr. B.L.  a 58-year-old East Asian male  presented to our emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. His medical history was notable for hypertension which was poorly controlled on a regimen of Amlodipine 10 mg and Losartan 100 mg. He had no history of smoking  alcohol  or recreational drug use. He worked a desk job and reported moderate levels of stress. His family history revealed a paternal uncle who was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm at 62 years.  Investigations:  Electrocardiography (ECG) indicated no acute ischemic changes. However  the severe chest pain prompted further investigation with a possibility of Aortic Dissection in mind. An urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan was arranged  which revealed a Type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the descending thoracic aorta. The true lumen was compressed  and moderate pericardial effusion was noted.   Management:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous Esmolol to control heart rate and maintain systolic blood pressure within target values to prevent further propagation of the dissection. The observation of Type A Aortic Dissection meant that Mr. B.L. required emergency surgery. A multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiothoracic surgeon  anesthesiologist  and intensivist was mobilized and the patient underwent successful surgical repair with an ascending aorta graft replacement and aortic valve resuspension.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Postoperative transthoracic echocardiogram showed good ventricular function with no aortic valve regurgitation. The patient had an uneventful recovery with an intensive care unit stay of 5 days  following which he was discharged. He was advised to continue anti-hypertensive medication and regular follow-ups every 6 months.   Conclusions:  In conclusion  this case underscores the fact that despite being less common among Asians  aortic dissection can be life-threatening without prompt diagnosis and management. This case reaffirms the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain and underlines the value of emergency imaging and surgery.  Patient Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

Aortic Dissection,7,98,"Title: A Case Report of Aortic Dissection in a 64-year-old Caucasian Male with a History of Hypertension  Introduction: Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening condition often associated with systemic hypertension and the male sex. This report illuminates a case of AD in a 64-year-old Caucasian male with a history of longstanding uncontrolled hypertension.  Case Report:  Patient Information: A 64-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back. He was a retired engineer  a non-smoker with a history of poorly controlled hypertension  and he was not under any medication for the condition.  Clinical Findings: Upon arrival to ED  the patient was diaphoretic with severe distress due to the pain. His blood pressure was 220/130 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Auscultation revealed a regular rhythm without any murmurs or added sounds. His neurological examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern  but no evidence of ischemic changes. Chest x-ray showed mediastinal widening. Labs were notable for a raised D-dimer level. The combination of the patient's symptoms  hypertension  and widened mediastinum on chest X-ray led to the suspicion of aortic dissection. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest confirmed a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous labetalol for strict blood pressure control and was taken urgently to the operating room for surgical intervention  where he underwent an emergent ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Postoperatively  the patient was initially managed in the intensive care unit and then transferred to the ward. He made a slow but steady recovery  with his blood pressure falling to more acceptable levels. During the follow-up visits at 1 month and 6 months post-surgery  his graft was patent and he confirmed improved adherence to his new antihypertensive medication regimen. He remains free of any new cardiovascular complaints.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is often deadly if not recognized and treated immediately. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension  like ours  are at a significant risk. The case highlights the importance of rapid diagnosis and management in AD  lending credibility to the phrase """"time is the aorta."""" The emergent surgical intervention was the lifesaving measure in this case emphasizing the paramount importance of early recognition and high index of suspicion for this catastrophic disease.   Conclusion: This case of aortic dissection in a hypertensive patient underscores the severe implications of hypertension and the importance of its effective management to prevent life-threatening complications such as AD. Healthcare practitioners must maintain a high index of suspicion and act swiftly to diagnose and treat such conditions in hypertensive patients."

Aortic Dissection,7,100,"Title: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-aged Hypertensive Male: A Case Study  Introduction:   Aortic dissection  a serious condition arising from a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality globally  occurring more commonly in males aged 60-80 years  particularly those with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 67-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department (ED) with an acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. He described it as a """"tearing"""" pain that began a couple of hours ago while at home. The patient was obese with a BMI of 32  a known hypertensive for over a decade  and non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication. He had no prior history of smoking  alcohol use  or usage of any illicit substances. His family history was significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease.  On physical examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable  pale  and diaphoretic. Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 195/115 mmHg  heart rate of 108 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur best heard over the right sternal border.  Differential diagnosis included acute myocardial infarction  aortic dissection  and pulmonary embolism. Immediate lab tests were ordered which revealed a markedly elevated D-dimer and a negative troponin-I. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening. An ECG displayed nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no evidence of ischemia or infarction.   Given the severity of presenting symptoms  a history of hypertension and the results of the initial investigations  a CT angiogram of the chest was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta.   Discussion:  The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for an aortic arch replacement along with a concomitant Bentall procedure. His postoperative course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury  but he showed gradual improvement with aggressive management. Upon discharge  he was educated on the importance of blood pressure control and adherence to medications. A multidisciplinary team approach involving cardiology  cardiothoracic surgery  and a nurse case manager was utilized for comprehensive care coordination.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the catastrophic potential of aortic dissection  particularly in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Early recognition and immediate management are critical for survival. It also underscores the need for patient education and engagement in managing chronic hypertension to prevent deadly complications such as aortic dissection. "

Aortic Dissection,9,1,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male  with a BMI of 29  presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as an intense  tearing sensation that began abruptly. He has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  with an average BP range of 156/92 mmHg. He has been non-compliant with his hypertension medication  lisinopril  and has not been diligent about lifestyle modifications suggested by his previous physicians. He also has chronic kidney disease (stage 3) and is a 20-pack-year smoker.  Family history is significant for his father who died from myocardial infarction at the age of 64 and a younger brother (59-year-old) diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm. He reports having a stressful work environment and locomotion deficits due to osteoarthritis  contributing to minimal physical activity. He admits to consuming a high-salt and high-fat diet often due to convenience though he is aware this may not be best for his health conditions.  On examination  heart rate was 85 bpm and blood pressure was 190/115 mmHg in his right arm and 160/100 mmHg in his left arm  generating suspicion. A trace of blood was found in his urine during a urinalysis exam. An urgent transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiogram showed a tearing in the intimal layer of the aorta.  The sudden onset of severe pain  hypertension history  discrepancy in blood pressure readings between arms  and findings from the echocardiogram led to the diagnosis of an aortic dissection.   The patient was immediately started on medication to reduce his blood pressure and heart rate  namely labetalol  and was planned for emergency surgery. Family members were briefed about the high-risk procedure and the need for lifetime commitment towards comprehensive management of the patient's hypertension. Developing a proper diet  cessation of smoking  stress management  and an appropriate exercise regimen were discussed for future management. Future consultations with a rheumatologist for osteoarthritis management and a psychiatrist for dealing with job-related stress were also recommended.   The presentation presented above is a depiction of a true aortic dissection case  which is more commonly found in African-American populations  men  and individuals with hypertension. History of smoking  CKD  and family history of cardiovascular diseases makes the patient more vulnerable and supports the necessity of an integrated approach to management.
Aortic Dissection,9,2,"Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection   I. Introduction  Mr. Johnson is a 64-year-old African-American male presenting with complaints of severe chest and back pain  which he describes as """"ripping"""". Aortic dissection is more common in males and the prevalence is higher in the African American population. The symptoms started about 2 hours prior  during his usual morning walk.   II. Past Medical History  Patient has a known history of hypertension for the last 20 years  which is poorly controlled due to non-adherence to medication. He is a smoker (30 pack-years history) and consumes moderate alcohol. He does not have a history of illicit drug use. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years back and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).   III. Family History  Mr. Johnson's father died at the age of 70 due to a stroke  and his mother died at 60 due to heart disease. His elder brother  aged 70  is diagnosed with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  IV. Social History  He worked as a mechanic till he retired 4 years back. He lives with his wife  and they have 2 adult children who are healthy. He admits not following an exercise regimen and regularly consumes high fat  high sodium food.  V. Physical Examination  The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic on examination. His blood pressure is found to be 200/110 mm Hg in right arm  and 160/90 mm Hg in left arm. His heart rate is 110 bpm  with regular rhythm. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur  and chest examination shows reduced breath sounds in the left lower zone.  VI. Diagnosis   Based on the patient's symptoms of severe  tearing chest and back pain along with his past history and clinical examination  a provisional diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.   VII. Investigations   CT angiogram of the chest was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection. Echocardiogram showed a dilated aortic root  and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels indicating left ventricular dysfunction.  VIII. Treatment  The patient was immediately started on beta-blockers and nitroprusside to reduce blood pressure and heart rate. He was taken to the operating room for emergent surgical repair.  IX. Conclusion  This case illustrates the importance of early recognition of aortic dissection  a life-threatening but potentially treatable condition  especially in patients with risk factors like male gender  age over 60  hypertension  smoking  and previous cardiovascular disease.

Aortic Dissection,9,3,"Patient Presentation:  Patient: Mr. Rodriguez  Age: 60-year-old  Race: Hispanic   Occupation: Retired  previously worked in logistics  Presenting Complaint: Chest pain radiating to the back  Previous Medical History: Hypertensive for 10 years  Social History: Non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  Family History: Father passed away at 65 from a stroke  Mother has diabetes. No history of cardiovascular disease.  Admission Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  was admitted to the hospital with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as """"tearing"""" in quality and radiating to the back. His pain started about 2 hours before. He describes it as the most severe pain he has ever experienced.   On examination  Mr. Rodriguez’s was anxious with pain score of 10. The blood pressure in his right arm was significantly higher than his left arm. There were normal heart sounds with no murmurs  but with slight diastolic decrescendo murmur. His lower limbs were cold and pulses were diminished.  Diagnostic Procedures: He had a computed tomography (CT) done which showed an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were within normal range  d-dimer was elevated. His kidney function tests were slightly raised and liver function tests were normal.  Treatment Plan: Given the nature of his condition  Mr. Rodriguez was taken to the operating suite for an emergent aortic repair after his hemodynamic situation was stabilized with Intravenous fluids and Intra-arterial nitroprussides. Post-operatively  he will be followed up in the cardiology clinic and given medications to control his blood pressure.  Conclusion: This case underscores the crucial importance of recognizing the characteristic features of acute aortic dissection. Any acute severe chest pain with differences in blood pressures among arms should alert the clinician to the possibility of aortic dissection. This condition is a life-threatening emergency and requires immediate surgical intervention  especially when it involves the ascending aorta. It should be suspected particularly in hypertensive patients who present with chest pain."
Aortic Dissection,9,4,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male TC  who is an ex-smoker with a 30-pack year history and a known history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic alcoholism. He reports to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  sharp chest and back pain that started approximately 2 hours ago while he was in his garden. The pain is rated at a 10 on a 10-point scale and radiates to his upper abdomen.  TC's vital signs show an elevated blood pressure of 185/110 mmHg  a pulse rate of 105 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. He appears acutely ill and is visibly anxious. The pain is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. There is a discrepancy in blood pressure between his right and left arms.  Past Medical History: TC has been under treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years. He has been non-compliant to his medication regimen (amlodipine  hydrochlorothiazide  and rosuvastatin)  which has been noted on multiple clinic visits. He also has a 30-year history of alcoholism but quit smoking ten years ago.  Family History: TC's father died at the age of 73 from a myocardial infarction. His mother  aged 86  has been diagnosed with chronic heart failure. He also has a younger brother who suffers from diabetes.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram shows no signs of myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed in ED indicates a dilated aortic root and an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta extending into the descending aorta. Laboratory findings reveal raised cardiac enzymes and slightly impaired renal function.  Management and outcome: TC was immediately started on intravenous labetalol for his hypertensive crisis. A cardiovascular surgery consult was placed  and he underwent successful emergent surgical repair of his aortic dissection. Post-surgical recovery was complicated by transient acute renal failure  likely due to the compromised blood supply secondary to the dissection. However  TC's renal function improved with medical management.  The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for amlodipine  metoprolol  atorvastatin  and aspirin. He was extensively counseled on the importance of medication compliance  lifestyle modification  regular follow-up  and blood pressure monitoring.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the potentially fatal nature of aortic dissection  especially in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Timely identification and intervention saved the patient’s life  but it emphasizes the need for regular monitoring and compliance to treatment in patients with hypertension to prevent such emergencies.

Aortic Dissection,9,5,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden and severe sharp pain in his chest and upper back  radiating down to his abdomen. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and rated it a 10 on a 0-10 scale. He also reported shortness of breath  fainting spells  and weakness in one side of his body.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled despite being on two antihypertensive medications. He also has a history of tobacco use  consuming a half-pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years. He quit smoking two years ago upon the advice of his primary care physician. He has no history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or other cardiovascular diseases.  Family History: His father died from a stroke in his early sixties  and his mother has been diagnosed with hypertension. His younger brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 55 and has since managed his heart health through diet  exercise  and medication. There is no known family history of aortic dissection or other aortic diseases.  Physical Examination and Diagnostics: On examination  Mr. Johnson appeared in severe distress. His blood pressure was significantly elevated with differing readings on both arms. Heart sounds were normal  but a diastolic murmur was detected. EKG showed no signs of myocardial infarction. Laboratory findings revealed slightly elevated D-dimer levels  and complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) were within normal limits. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Plan: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with a Stanford type A aortic dissection  an emergent condition. He was stabilized with medication to control his blood pressure and promptly referred to cardiothoracic surgery for surgical management.  Discussion: This case illustrates the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with uncontrolled hypertension and severe chest or back pain  especially with a history of smoking. The prevalence of aortic dissection is significantly higher in males and increases with age  aligning with Mr. Johnson’s demographic. African-Americans have a higher risk of developing the disease compared to other racial groups. Furthermore  hypertension is the most common risk factor  present in up to 75% of cases. If left untreated  aortic dissection can lead to aortic rupture and death  emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis and management."
Aortic Dissection,9,6,Patient Presentation  Patient X  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with acute  severe chest pain. The pain was described as a tearing sensation  starting from his chest and radiating to his back. Upon medical consultation  the patient revealed a history of hypertension and smoking. His blood pressure at presentation was markedly high  reading 175/95 mmHg. He had no record of regular medications  reflecting poor control of hypertension. Family history revealed his father had died from a stroke  possibly suggesting a familial susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases.  The patient's symptoms and past medical history aroused a strong suspicion for aortic dissection  an often-fatal condition that has a predilection for elderly males  specifically within the African-American population. Patient X was immediately sent for a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed an aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending to the descending aorta classifying it as Stanford Type A aortic dissection  a medical emergency.  The patient's past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension likely contributed to his current diagnosis. Chronic hypertension causes considerable stress on the heart and the blood vessels  leading to several cardiovascular complications  including aortic dissection. His smoking habit could also have played a contributory role  as smoking is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease.  The patient was promptly started on medication to urgently lower his blood pressure. Simultaneously  the cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted for an emergent surgical evaluation considering the patient's classification and ongoing symptoms.  In summary  Patient X's case presents an example of a high-risk demographic for aortic dissection  which is typically seen in elderly  hypertensive African-American males with a family history of cardiovascular disease. The importance of regular hypertension control  lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation in these demographics cannot be overstressed considering the potentially catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled hypertension.
Aortic Dissection,9,7,Case Presentation:  Demographics and History: Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who retired five years ago from a bank job. He is married  has two adult children and lives in a suburban environment. Patient X is a non-smoker with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are controlled with medication- Thiazide diuretic and a statin  respectively. He has no known drug allergies. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and his mother had a history of stroke before passing away at 78.  Presenting Issue: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back that started suddenly while performing yard work in his garden. His blood pressure was found to be elevated in his right arm compared to his left arm. This symptom  combined with his previous medical history and the nature of his pain  led to a suspicion of aortic dissection.  Evaluation and Diagnosis: Upon examination  the patient appeared pale and sweating  but without signs of neurological deficit  pulmonary rales  or limb ischemia. An electrocardiogram displayed no signs of myocardial ischemia. Chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum. With suspicion of aortic dissection  a Computerized Tomography Angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the aortic arch.  Current Status and Plan: The patient was transferred to the surgical ICU and referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon. Medical management was initiated immediately to control heart rate and blood pressure with intravenous medications – Metoprolol for heart rate and Nitroprusside for blood pressure control.  Conclusion: This case presents a patient who is at higher risk of aortic dissection due to hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular diseases in the setting of sudden severe chest pain. Prompt diagnosis using a CTA of the chest was critical in identifying the aortic dissection and warranted immediate surgical consultation. His management focused on immediate stabilization of hemodynamics  prompt surgical consultation given the high risk of rupture associated with type A dissections  and appropriate preoperative medical therapy.

Aortic Dissection,9,8,Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male with a BMI of 32. He lives in an urban community and is retired from a mid-level laborer position.  Chief Complaint: Severe chest pain  radiating to his back.  History of Present Illness: The patient reported to the ER with complaints of a sudden onset of intense  tearing chest pain that started approximately 3 hours ago  and has gradually increased. The pain radiates to his back and left arm. Accompanied by sweating  nausea  and dyspnea.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the years. He has a 30-year history of cigarette smoking  but quit 10 years ago. Previous medical records also reveal an episode of transient ischemic attack five years ago.  Family History: The patient's father passed away from a stroke at age 72  and his mother passed away at age 78 from congestive heart failure. He has a younger brother  age 62  who has no significant cardiac history.  Physical Examination: On examination  blood pressure in the right arm was found to be more than 20 mm Hg higher than that in the left arm. His heart rate was rapid and irregular. There was a diastolic murmur audible over the right second intercostal space.   Investigations: A CT scan confirmed a diagnosis of aortic dissection. An EKG indicated left ventricular hypertrophy but no evidence of an acute myocardial infarction. Blood tests showed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes.  Treatment and Management: The patient was immediately started on beta-blockers to control blood pressure and decrease shear stress on the aorta  and later underwent emergency surgery to repair the dissected aorta.  Conclusion: This patient’s long-standing history of hypertension along with his smoking history significantly increased his risk for aortic dissection. It underlines the fact that stringent blood pressure control is pivotal in preventing such catastrophes. This patient's son  given the family history  should be advised regarding the genetic predisposition and need for regular check-ups.   This case emphasizes the need for an immediate and accurate diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection  which is a life-threatening condition. It also underscores the importance of chronic hypertension management and smoking cessation. 
Aortic Dissection,9,9,Patient Identity: Male  65-year-old  African American  Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Symptoms: The patient  Mr. M  arrived at the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe tearing chest pain radiating to his back. He was also experiencing shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and dizziness.  Past Medical History: He has had hypertension for the past 10 years which is poorly controlled on medication. He has a 20-year history of smoking  consuming approximately one pack a day. He also reported a history of occasional alcohol use. There is no evidence of diabetes or any other significant illness in his medical record.  Family History: His father passed away at 70 due to a stroke  and his mother has hypertension and diabetes. He has one brother who was diagnosed with an aneurysm at an early age.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient had high blood pressure - 180/110 mm Hg. He was hyperhidrosis and dyspneic while his pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. Auscultation over the aorta revealed a diastolic murmur.  Investigation: An electrocardiogram showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. His lab tests  including complete blood count  coagulation profile  liver function test  and kidney function test were all normal. D-dimer was elevated  as expected in these cases.  Imaging: A CT angiogram of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection originating just beyond the aortic root and extending into the descending aorta.  Hospital Course: The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac care unit. A cardiothoracic surgeon was consulted  and the patient was taken for emergency surgery to repair the aortic dissection.  Prognosis: The patient's prognosis depends on surgical outcomes and how well his other conditions  such as high blood pressure  are managed post-surgery. Timely recognition and appropriate management of aortic dissection significantly improve prognosis.  This case highlights the association of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and smoking with aortic dissection. Both conditions were likely contributors to our patient's presentation  suggesting the need for aggressive risk factor management and patient education on potential symptoms that might suggest an aortic dissection event.  This case also underlines disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates around the globe and  especially  among racial and ethnic groups. African Americans have higher rates of hypertension compared with other racial or ethnic groups in the U.S  and they are also more likely to experience complications from high blood pressure  which may partly explain the occurrence of aortic dissection in this patient. This racial disparity brings to light the importance of appropriate screening and management strategies  especially in high-risk groups.
Aortic Dissection,9,10,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J. Rodriguez  a 65-year old Hispanic male  presented with a sudden onset of severe  tearing pain in his upper back and chest. He is an ex-smoker and has a known history of hypertension which has been inconsistently controlled for about 10 years. He denies drug or alcohol abuse. Mr. Rodriguez is married  father to three adult children  and works as a mechanic.  Relevant Medical History:  On reviewing his past medical history  Mr. Rodriguez has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) secondary to his prior tobacco use. He is marginally compliant with his antihypertensive medication (amlodipine)  and his blood pressure at previous visits ranged from 145/90 to 165/95. He denies any previous cardiac history  including myocardial infarction  congestive heart failure  or valvular diseases. There is no past surgical history to note.  Family History:  Mr. Rodriguez shared that his father passed away at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction  while his mother had a stroke at the age of 68 and now resides in a nursing home due to vascular dementia. One of his sisters was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 50s. His family history is significant due to these instances of cardiovascular disease and malignancy.   Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Rodriguez appeared in acute distress  clutching his chest. His vitals revealed a blood pressure of 180/100mmHg  heart rate of 95 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F). His cardiovascular exam showed a distant heart sound but no murmur or pericardial rub was heard. The rest of his physical examination was relatively unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given his presentation and past medical history  emergency computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed  which revealed an aortic dissection from the level of the aortic arch down to the renal arteries  consistent with Stanford Type B Aortic Dissection. His blood tests including full blood count  liver function tests  and renal function were relatively normal  while his troponin I level was slightly elevated.  Management Plan:  Mr. Rodriguez was transferred promptly to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control and was started on intravenous beta-blockers. Emergency surgery consultation was done and it was decided to manage him conservatively given the type of dissection.  Conclusion:  This case sheds light on a relatively common yet underdiagnosed cardiovascular condition. Prompt recognition and aggressive management are essential to improve outcomes. It also emphasizes the importance of adequate blood pressure control in patients with known hypertension to prevent serious complications such as aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,9,11,Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection   Demographics:   The patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension and smoking. He is retired and lives with his wife. He has three adult children and six grandchildren. The patient is well-educated and is a retired engineer. He has a consistent record of receiving medical check-ups and follows prescribed treatment plans.   Past Medical History:  He has a chronic history of uncontrolled hypertension over the past 10 years. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  which is currently managed with Metformin. The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 years back from which he successfully recovered with mild residual left ventricular dysfunction. The patient has a medical history of hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease. He has a 30-year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. No history of substance abuse and no known allergies.   Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60. His mother is alive and in good health. His paternal uncle died from stroke and his maternal uncle from aortic aneurysm rupture. Two of his three siblings have hypertension. No family history of connective tissue disorders or genetic syndromes.   Presenting Complaint:   The patient presented with sudden sever chest pain which he described as ripping and tearing  radiating to the back. The pain is accompanied by shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and syncope.  On physical examination  his blood pressure was found different in both arms. He had weak pulses in the lower extremities and there was a diastolic murmur noticed best at the aortic area.  Diagnostic Tests:   The electrocardiogram suggested no recent significant ischemic changes. His chest X-ray revealed mediastinal widening suggestive of dissection involving the ascending aorta. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) which revealed a type A aortic dissection.  Treatment and Discussion:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous esmolol to decrease heart rate and blood pressure and reduce the shear stress on the aortic wall. Due to the presentation with a type A aortic dissection  which is a surgical emergency  the patient was quickly referred to the cardiothoracic surgeons. His family was informed and education provided about risk associated with surgery. Consent was taken and he underwent an emergent surgical intervention - a successful Bentall procedure (aortic root and valve replacement with a composite graft).  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with uncontrolled hypertension who present with acute severe chest pain. Immediate diagnosis and prompt treatment in this case  even in the face of multiple co-morbidities  prevented the potential catastrophic outcomes associated with this condition. 
Aortic Dissection,9,12,"Patient Presentation:  Introduction: Mr. Johnstone  a 62-year-old African American male  presented himself to the emergency department. He mentioned a sudden-onset  severe chest pain that radiated to his back  describing it as """"tearing or ripping"""". His pain began 40 minutes prior to his visit while gardening at home. He further reported experiencing a shortness of breath as the day progressed.  Past Medical History: This patient was a retiree who lived alone. He had a 25-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 6-year history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus. He was a former smoker with no history of illicit drug use. His medication included Metformin and Lisinopril  which he admitted to occasionally forgetting.   Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his mother of stroke in her early 70s. His younger brother  aged 59  was recently diagnosed with prehypertension. The patient had one son who was healthy.  Physical Examination and Diagnostics: Mr. Johnstone appeared anxious; his BP was asymmetric with 170/95 mmHg on the right arm and 155/85 mmHg on the left. He was mildly tachycardic with a pulse rate of 102 bpm  had a slight diaphoresis but no fever. Pulses were also asymmetric  and there was a relatively faint diastolic murmur. Because of the severity of his symptoms and medical history  an immediate CT scan was performed revealing a Type B aortic dissection.  Hospital Course: Mr. Johnstone was admitted in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit  initiated on intravenous (IV) beta blockers to lower his blood pressure and decrease the sheer stress on the aortic wall  and IV analgesia for pain management. Following cardiologist consultation  the patient was managed conservatively with aggressive blood pressure control and monitored closely. He remained stable and was discharged on oral medications with plans for outpatient surveillance.  Discussion: Mr. Johnstone's demographic profile and medical history align with the typical features seen in patients with aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is more prevalent among African American individuals and in males with ages between 60-80. It has an increased association with hypertension  contributing to an estimated 75% of cases. This patient’s uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  stressful activity  and significant family history of cardiovascular disease are all contributing risk factors.     Preventive strategies should focus on controlling the blood pressure and perhaps stricter medication adherence to prevent such a serious issue could be suggested to Mr. Johnstone."
Aortic Dissection,9,13,Case Presentation Demographics: Mr. A  a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  presented to the hospital complaining of severe chest pain that started while he was gardening at home. He is a retired New York lawyer and lives with his wife.   Past Medical History: His past medical history reveals that the patient is hypertensive; a condition well-managed with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol). He is also a former smoker  having quit for the last decade  but still has a smoking history of 35 years. His last recorded blood pressure a month ago was 135/85 mmHg. There were no reports of dyslipidemia  diabetes  cardiovascular disorders  or any other significant past medical condition.  Family History: There is a noted family history of cardiovascular diseases  with Mr. A's father having passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and a brother who had a stroke at 58.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. A complained of tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as sudden in onset and severe. His wife confirmed that he appeared pale  anxious  and sweaty at the time the symptoms occurred.  Clinical Examination & Investigations: On physical examination  Mr. A had unequal blood pressures in both arms (Left arm BP was 150/90 mmHg  while the right arm BP was 130/80 mmHg) with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and his respiratory rate was 20 breaths per min. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs.  An immediate ECG was done in the ER. It was normal  ruling out myocardial infarction. However  considering the acute onset of symptoms and the unequal blood pressures  a CT angiogram was performed  which showed a dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending to the descending thoracic aorta  indicating a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.   Treatment & Follow Up: Mr. A was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his heart rate and blood pressure  then was taken to the operating room for surgery. The surgical procedure was successful and postoperatively; Mr. A was started on long-term antihypertensive medications. He is being monitored closely in follow-up appointments every month.  Summary: This case showcases the crucial importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis for all patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially when the clinical history includes hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore  measuring blood pressure in both arms can be a vital tool for initial clinical evaluation.
Aortic Dissection,9,14,Case Presentation:  Patient: 70-Year-old African American male   Presenting Complaint: Sudden severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping  radiated to his back  along with a feeling of faintness and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Notably  the patient has a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) over the past 10 years  despite prescribed medication. He was also diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome in his early 40's and has managed the condition with regular follow-ups. Additionally  he had a brief smoking history during his mid-30’s but quit smoking 30 years ago. He reports moderate alcohol use and an unremarkable drug history.   Current Medications: Lisinopril (for hypertension)  Aspirin (for cardiac prophylaxis)  Propranolol (for Marfan syndrome).  Family History: His father passed away from a heart attack and his mother was diagnosed with hypertension. Marfan syndrome is also found within his family line with his mother and younger sister reporting the same diagnosis.  Physical Examination: Pale and sweaty  appears acutely ill. Blood pressure reading is significantly different between both arms  with the right arm recording at 170/95  and the left at 145/90. Pulse is rapid and irregular. Diagnosis was confirmed through a CT scan showing an abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta with an intimal flap.  Treatment: The patient was emergently managed with intravenous beta blockers to lower his heart rate and blood pressure. He was also started on pain management. Surgery was decided upon consultation with the cardiothoracic surgeon to repair the dissection.  Discussion: This patient's case is typical of aortic dissections  as the demographic most likely to have an aortic dissection are men in their sixties and seventies. Hypertension is a risk factor for developing this condition  and Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder affecting connective tissues also increases the risk of aortic dissections. Early intervention and management of hypertension could have potentially mitigated the development of this dangerous complication.   Education and Support Measures: The patient was counseled on the importance of adhering to medication regimes and maintaining regular follow-ups. Lifestyle modifications  including diet  exercise  reducing alcohol  and quitting smoking  were duly emphasized. Genetic counseling was also considered for the immediate family members.   Emergency preparedness in case of potential further episodes to respond to symptoms promptly was also communicated to the patient and his family. Follow-up care plans  including continued medication  aortic imaging  lifestyle modification  and monitoring for complications  were set in place.
Aortic Dissection,9,15,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  aged 65 years  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest and back pain that began while he was lifting a heavy object at home. He describes that the pain is significantly worse while lying down and feels slightly better when sitting up and leaning forward. Mr. Smith rates the pain as an """"11"""" on the scale of """"10"""". Checks revealed his heart rate at 100 bpm  blood pressure at 180/95 mmHg in the right arm  and 165/90 mmHg in the left arm. He had no fever and was slightly diaphoretic.  Demographics:   Mr. Smith is a light-skinned American of European descent  hailing from the Midwest region  with a lower-middle-class background.   Past Medical History:  He reports a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years for which he takes Lisinopril and Amlodipine. He also has a 35-pack year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He is a retired industrial worker and reports chronic pain in his lower back and osteoarthritis with a history of right knee and hip replacement 2 years ago.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of heart disease; his father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at 72 and his younger sister is under treatment for heart failure. Mr. Smith reports no known genetic disorders in the family.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  there were bilateral carotid bruits and a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right intercostal space. His pulses were mildly asymmetric with the left brachial and radial pulses being slightly weaker than the right. MRI ordered showed a dissection in the ascending aorta  thus diagnosing Mr. Smith with Stanford type A aortic dissection.   Discussion:  Mr. Smith's case of aortic dissection is likely related to his long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension  his previous smoking habit and family history of heart disease. A review of literature confirms that the most common symptom of aortic dissection is severe chest or back pain  with hypertension being the most common comorbidity  followed by smoking. Furthermore  men aged 60-70 and individuals with a family history of heart disease or genetic conditions influencing the vascular system  like Marfan syndrome  are at a higher risk.  Mr. Smith's treatment plan would involve immediate and aggressive control of his blood pressure  likely in the ICU  followed by prompt surgical intervention to repair the dissection which is the recommended treatment for Stanford type A aortic dissections."
Aortic Dissection,9,16,"Case Presentation  Patient Profile Mr. John Smith is a 64-year-old White-American man of Irish descent living in Boston  Massachusetts. He is a retired civil engineer  and he is known to have a 30-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications for years  with the argument that they make him feel uncomfortable. He has no history of diabetes  kidney disease  or cancer. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases; his father passed away at the age of 70 from a heart attack and his mother had a stroke at age 68. He smoked for about 20 years but quit 15 years ago and consumes alcohol socially.  Presenting Complaints Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that started while he was doing yard work. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" that radiates to his back. Additionally  he reported feeling shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and temporary blurred vision at the onset of the pain.  Clinical Findings His vitals on presentation were as follows: BP- 200/110 mmHg  Pulse- 110/min  RR- 22/min  Temp- 37.1 C  Saturation- 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed evidence of acute aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur over the left sternal border) and decreased peripheral pulses.  Investigations  His lab results showed normal cell count  kidney function  liver function  and electrolytes. EKG showed no sign of ischemia or any acute event. However  the CT angiogram of the chest was performed due to suspicion of aortic dissection  which confirmed the diagnosis  showing a Stanford Type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta.  Management Given the emergent nature of the disease  he was immediately prepared for surgery and was transferred to a tertiary referral center. He underwent successful emergent surgery for his aortic dissection. Post-surgery  he was put on beta-blockers  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  and statins  to control his blood pressure and hyperlipidemia.  Educational Points and Summary This case illustrates:  1. The potential fatal consequences of uncontrolled chronic conditions like hypertension and hyperlipidemia. 2. The importance of complaint with medication despite the side effects. 3. The significance of classic presentation—severe  tearing chest pain radiating to back in recognizing aortic dissection in patients presenting with chest pain.  4. This case similarly stresses the essence of early recognition of symptoms  prompt imaging diagnosis  and appropriate management of aortic dissection to prevent devastating complications like aortic rupture and cardiac arrest."
Aortic Dissection,9,17,Patient Information:  Mr. Ramos is a 60-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity. He is a retired firefighter and lives with his wife in the suburbs. He has been a non-smoker for the last 10 years. However  he used to smoke one pack a day for 30 years before quitting. He consumes alcohol occasionally and exercises regularly.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Ramos has been managing hypertension for the past ten years and has type 2 diabetes mellitus for about five years. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia. Ramirez has been on amlodipine and carvedilol for hypertension  metformin for diabetes  and statins for hyperlipidemia. His blood pressures  blood sugars  and cholesterol levels are well controlled.   Family History:  There's a pertinent family history as his father passed away in his late 60s following a heart attack  and his maternal uncle suffered from a stroke in his early 70s.   Presenting Issue:  Mr. Ramos presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back  beginning approximately 4 hours before arriving at the ED. The pain is described as 'tearing' and 'ripping' in nature  extremely severe  and unlike any pain experienced before. There was associated shortness of breath  but no associated nausea  vomiting  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.   Physical Examination & Diagnostic tests:  His blood pressure was 165/89 mmHg and 150/85 mmHg in the right and left arms  respectively. His heart rate was slightly elevated at 98 beats per minute  with no significant difference between radial and femoral pulses. A chest X-ray raised suspicions of an aortic aneurysm with mediastinal widening. A subsequent contrast CT scan confirmed an acute type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the level of the renal arteries. Troponin levels were normal  ruling out a concurrent myocardial infarction.  Impression & Plan:  Mr. Ramos was diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection  likely due to long-standing hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. This is a surgical emergency  requiring an immediate consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon for potential surgical intervention. Additionally  the management plan includes strict blood pressure control using IV labetalol and adequate pain control. His family was informed of the condition  and they consented for any necessary surgical intervention.   This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients with hypertension who present with acute severe chest pain. It is also a reminder of the role of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia as potential risk factors for aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,9,18,Patient Presentation:  Mr. T  a 62-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his back. He described the onset of the symptoms as sudden and intense. Concurrently  he reported shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom. He has a history of hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril. He has a twenty-year history of smoking but quit smoking ten years ago. He reports being non-compliant with his medication regimen due to side effects.  Detailed Information:  Mr. T is a retired civil servant with Medicare insurance. He lives with his wife of 35 years. He is a father to three adult children  and two of them live out of state. He has three grandchildren. He is originally from the southeastern United States but resides in a large urban metropolis.  In regards to his social history  Mr. T has a twenty-year history of smoking cigarettes but quit ten years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use.   His family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases - his father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 58  and his elder brother had a stroke at 65.  On physical examination  he appeared acutely distressed  with mild respiratory distress. Initial vitals were Blood Pressure- 180/100 mmHg  Pulse- 110/min  Respiratory rate- 20/min  and Oxygen Saturation- 96% on room air. On cardiovascular examination  a harsh systolic murmur was heard at the right upper sternal border. The auscultation of the lungs was clear with no adventitial sounds. His ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy  and the Chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum.  Laboratory studies showed a normal complete blood count  renal function test  and liver function test. Cardiac Troponin I was within normal limits. The d-Dimer level was significantly elevated.  A contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the thorax was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of a Type A Aortic Dissection.  Given the patient's condition and discomfort  the surgical team was urgently consulted for a surgical intervention.  Reflection on the Patient:  Mr. T's case falls into the demographic distribution for aortic dissections  which are most common in males aged 60-70 years with a history of hypertension. Noncompliance to antihypertensive medication regimen can cause severe complications. While he does not have connective tissue disorders or a family history of aortic diseases  which contribute to about 20% of cases  he does have a significant cardiovascular disease family history. This case also highlights the cardinal features of aortic dissection - sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back  elevated blood pressure  and widened mediastinum on chest X-ray.   This case underlines the importance of recognizing the symptoms of an aortic dissection promptly to reduce the patient's morbidity and mortality rate. Even though it is often misdiagnosed due to its varied presentations  keeping a high index of suspicion in someone with a similar demographic presentation and severe sudden chest or back pain would be key to reduce associated high mortality rates.
Aortic Dissection,9,19,"Patient Information Patient Initials: J.D. Sex: Male Age: 58-years-old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Accountant Insurance: Private insurance  Living Situation: Lives with wife in suburban area  Presenting Problem & Symptoms J.D. presented at the Emergency Department with acute onset of severe chest pain. Describes pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" that started suddenly about an hour ago.  Medical and Family History J.D. has an extensive medical history which includes untreated hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2). He is a former smoker (quit 5 years ago) and continues to consume alcohol modestly. His daily medications include Metformin  Atorvastatin  and Lisinopril but admits he is not always compliant. Family history reveals his father had an aortic aneurysm and died at an early age (60). His mother has type 2 diabetes and is being treated for hypertension.  Clinical Findings On examination  J.D. appeared distressed  pale  and diaphoretic. Vital signs on presentation were: BP 220/120mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiovascular examination showed irregular heartbeats and a loud diastolic murmur best heard over the right second intercostal space. CT angiogram was performed after initial suspicion of aortic dissection  which confirmed a Type A (ascending) aortic dissection.   Impression & Plan This patient is diagnosed with a Type A aortic dissection  which is an emergency. The uncontrolled hypertension likely contributed to the development of the aortic dissection. The condition is life-threatening and requires immediate surgical intervention. J.D. was immediately referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon and started on medication to reduce his blood pressure and heart rate. He will need extensive follow-up care  including regular monitoring of blood pressure and lifestyle modification  including dietary changes  physical activity  stress management  smoking cessation  and alcohol moderation.   Discussion Aortic dissection is a rare  but severe condition occurring most commonly in males in their 60s and 70s. Risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  smoking  dyslipidemia  pre-existing aortic aneurysm  family history  and specific genetic disorders. The most common symptom is severe  sudden onset chest pain. Early diagnosis  aggressive lowering of blood pressure and heart rate  and immediate surgical intervention significantly reduce mortality. Unfortunately  aortic dissection often presents late due to its rare occurrence and nonspecific clinical features  leading to delayed diagnosis: underlining the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and severe  unusual chest pain."
Aortic Dissection,9,20,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  presenting to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe  tearing chest pain that radiated to his back.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of chronic hypertension  which has been proven to be the most important risk factor for aortic dissection. He also has a 15-year history of smoking  with a pack a day  which further contributes to the risk. In addition  the patient reports a history of high cholesterol  intermittent claudication  previous peripheral angioplasty in the right leg  and height of 6ft (1.83m) which  according to recent studies  can increase the risk of this condition. Despite his advanced age  the patient has no known history of diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.  Demographics:  In general  aortic dissection is more common in men; it often occurs in the sixth and seventh decades of life  according to the literature. This patient falls within this demographic range. African American individuals have a higher risk than other racial or ethnic groups  and this patient is of African American descent.  Family History:  The patient has a family history of aortic dissection; his father died suddenly at age 65 from an undissected aortic aneurysm. Studies have revealed that 20% of patients suffering from aortic dissection have a family history of this condition.  Current Presentation:  Upon arrival at the ER  the patient was diaphoretic and distressed. His blood pressure was notably higher in his right than in his left arm  and there was a delay in the femoral pulse compared to the radial pulse  both signs indicative of aortic dissection. The patient required immediate transfer to critical care for further management.  CBC  metabolic panel  coagulation profiles were all within normal limits  with the exception of elevated d-dimer. Immediate CT angiography revealed Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the proximal part of the abdominal aorta  confirmed the diagnosis.  Case Discussion:  The patient's history  presenting symptoms and the subsequent radiological findings were all consistent with an acute aortic dissection. Given the patient's advanced age  chronic hypertension  smoking history  family history  and his height  he falls into a high-risk group for aortic dissection. Considering the life-threatening nature of aortic dissection  immediate surgical intervention was warranted.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with a combination of risk factors and a classic clinical presentation of unexplained severe pain  differential blood pressure measurements  and a suspicious family history. Early diagnosis and management can significantly improve the prognosis in this otherwise deadly condition.
Aortic Dissection,9,21,Patient Introduction  The patient is a 63-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension  tobacco use  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He is retired from a shipping and logistics company and lives with his wife. The patient presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Medical History  The patient is overweight with a BMI of 32. He was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and currently takes a daily anti-hypertensive medication. He has been a smoker for 40 years and drinks alcohol occasionally but does not have any known drug allergies. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) about five years ago  with full recovery. His daily medications include an aspirin  a beta-blocker  and a statin.  Family History  The patient's father died in his early 50s due to a heart attack  and his maternal uncle had a stroke at the age of 60. His mother is alive and has hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The patient is unaware of any family history of aneurysms or connective tissue disorders. His elder brother has a history of cardiac arrhythmia.  Clinical Presentation  The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden  excruciating chest pain which began an hour ago. The pain was described as tearing and radiates to his back. Considering his age  history of hypertension  smoking  and the described nature of his symptoms  a high-level suspicion for aortic dissection was established.   Diagnostic Evaluation  On physical examination  the patient appeared in significant distress but was alert and oriented. ECG demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. His blood pressure was notably different in both arms with the left arm recording a significantly higher reading. Laboratory tests showed a moderately raised D-dimer level. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection that started just above his heart and extended into his descending aorta.  Treatment Plan  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower heart rate and blood pressure to reduce stress on the aorta. Subsequently  due to the nature and location of the dissection  he was referred for emergency surgery  which he successfully went through.  Conclusion  The patient's undiagnosed and controlled hypertension along with his extensive smoking history puts him at a high risk for aortic dissection. Early recognition of this potentially life-threatening condition and immediate treatment with antihypertensive therapy and surgical intervention dramatically improved the prognosis of this patient. The patient will subsequently be referred to a smoking cessation program and weight loss plan to reduce his cardiovascular risk further. This case reveals the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with chest pain and risk factors  to prevent devastating complications.
Aortic Dissection,9,22,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Martinez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back  described as tearing. His past medical history is significant for uncontrollable hypertension and he has a 25-year history of heavy smoking which he quit five years ago. One month ago  he had an episode of syncope with no clear diagnosis at another hospital and was advised to follow up with a cardiologist but could not do so due to lack of insurance.   On physical examination  the patient was pale  sweating  and in visible distress. His blood pressure was 210/110 mm Hg and pulse rate was fluctuating between 100-120 bpm  which is above the normal range indicative of tachycardia.  Laboratory findings revealed a WBC count of 12 000 cells/µL  mildly elevated troponin levels  and a D-dimer value exceeding 1000 ng/mL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy with strain but no overt signs of ischemia.  Chest computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the suspicion of aortic dissection  which showed an intimal flap extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Mr. Martinez's family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases. His father died at the age of 52 due to myocardial infarction and one of his two elder brothers had undiagnosed chest pain and died suddenly at 56. A younger sister is alive and has well-controlled hypertension.  Mr. Martinez’s case represents a common demographic for aortic dissection as literature shows it affects people chiefly in their 60s and 70s and more often in males. It is usually associated with hypertension and smoking. His lack of medical follow-up due to insurance issues also highlights a crucial societal problem that can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis  with potentially fatal consequences.  Management:  The emergency department clinicians promptly initiated antihypertensive therapy with intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside which led to the lowering of blood pressure to 120/80 mm Hg and control of heart rate. Mr. Martinez was emergently taken to the operating room for open repair of the dissected aorta in order to save his life.  This case underscores the importance of early recognition of aortic dissection in the ED  the role of vigilant monitoring and aggressive blood pressure control in the management  and timely surgical intervention. Mr. Martinez’s case also importantly highlights how healthcare access issues can play a critical role in patient outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,9,23,Patient Presentation: Mr. Santiago  a 65-year-old Hispanic man  presents to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as sharp and tearing.  Past Medical History: Mr. Santiago has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and high cholesterol levels. He was a former smoker who quit 10 years ago  but he admits to being non-compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive medications. He is otherwise healthy with no history of surgeries. He is not diabetic nor does he have a history of any pulmonary diseases  liver diseases  or cancer.  Family History: His father experienced a similar complaint in his late 60s and passed away due to an aortic aneurysm - though it's unclear whether this was related to dissection or not. His mother and two sisters are healthy. His brother  however  suffers from hypertension and coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination and Findings: On examination  Mr. Santiago appears distressed due to the pain. He is found to be hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 180/110 mm Hg. There's no significant blood pressure difference in his upper limbs. His heart sounds are normal without any audible murmur. His distal pulses are palpable and equal bilaterally.  Investigation and Diagnosis: Given his symptoms and familial history of aortic aneurysm  a clinical suspicion made towards acute aortic dissection. Abdominal ultrasound and chest x-ray were inconclusive but then he underwent a CT angiogram of his aorta  which confirmed Type B aortic dissection.   Treatment: He was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure. The vascular surgery team was consulted  who decided on an initial conservative management given that it’s a Type B dissection. They recommend monitoring his vitals and regular imaging. However  they also noted that if there’s any uncontrolled hypertension  worsening pain  or signs of malperfusion  immediate surgical intervention would be considered.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering acute aortic dissection as a differential diagnosis in patients like Mr. Santiago presenting with unexplained chest pain especially when histories of hypertension and family related aortic illness are present. This condition often has high mortality if left untreated  but survival rates increase significantly with prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. Hence  the complication highlights that primary prevention through blood pressure control and promoting medication compliance is of utmost importance.

Family History: Both her parents died at a young age due to cardiovascular complications. Her father passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 64 and her mother from a stroke at age 67. One of her two brothers was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm at age 70.  Objective Findings: On admission  her blood pressure was high (195/110 mmHg)  with a difference between the two arms. The heart rate was slightly elevated (87 beats per minute)  and other vital signs were within normal limits. Examination revealed unequal pulses in the upper limbs. Chest auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur suggesting aortic regurgitation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.   Investigations: The ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of acute ischemia. An urgent CT angiogram detected a type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending to the descending aorta. Her blood tests showed high levels of D-dimer and slightly elevated cardiac troponin levels but were otherwise normal.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  physical findings  and imaging result  a diagnosis of aortic dissection was established.  Comments: This case presentation of an older Asian female with multiple risk factors features the acute onset of chest pain leading to the detection of a life-threatening aortic dissection. Her hypertension (possibly uncontrolled due to medication non-adherence)  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and family history of aortic aneurysm likely contributed to the development of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,9,25,Patient Profile: Mr. J  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer residing with his wife in the suburbs. He is a non-smoker but drinks socially. Mr. J has been battling hypertension for the last ten years and has been on medication. There is no history of drug abuse. His father had a history of heart disease and passed away from a heart attack at the age of 60.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. J visited the ER  complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  described as sharp and 'tearing' in nature  radiating to his back for the last three hours. He admitted to feeling light-headed but denied any loss of consciousness. No associated symptoms like breathlessness  palpitations  or sweating were seen. He denied any recent trauma  strenuous activity  or heavy lifting.  Clinical Examination: Physical examination showed high blood pressure (170/95 mmHg)  an irregular heartbeat  and a murmur over the chest. The rest of his physical examination was non-contributory.  Investigations: To confirm the suspicion of an aortic dissection  a Computerized Tomography Angiogram (CTA) was conducted. The CTA indicated an aortic dissection starting just after the aortic valve and extending into the descending aorta - classified as Stanford type A.  Management: Given the acute onset and confirmation of Stanford Type A aortic dissection  Mr. J was treated as a medical emergency. He was immediately started on medications to reduce his blood pressure and slow his heart rate. Urgent surgery was considered per guidelines and the cardiac surgical team was consulted.  Follow-up: Following surgery  a plan for the aggressive management of his hypertension  regular cardiac follow-ups including imaging studies  counselling on maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle  and the need for early presentation if similar symptoms reoccur were enforced.  This case reflects that sudden  severe chest pain  particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and a family history of heart disease  necessitates consideration of aortic dissection among the differential diagnoses. Timely diagnosis can be lifesaving in such patients.   References:  La dissection aortique. Diagnostic et prise en charge. (2012).

Aortic Dissection,9,26,Patient Profile  Mr. J.A. is a 64-year-old retired African American male  living in the urban area of Chicago  Illinois. He was a former mechanical engineer and has been living alone since his wife passed away three years ago. He is a non-smoker and reports minimal alcohol intake. His children live in different states but check on him regularly through phone calls and occasional visits.   Presenting Problem and Symptoms  Mr. J.A. presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe  sharp  and tearing chest pain that radiates to his back and was accompanied by shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and episodes of syncope. The chest pain started suddenly while he was carrying groceries from his car to his apartment.  Medical History   He has history of hypertension for which he takes oral medications. His blood pressure at home usually ranges from 140-150/80-90 mmHg. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and diabetes Which are currently under control with oral medication. Mr. J.A does not have a documented history of cardiac or thoracic conditions  but he has been non-compliant with his medication over the past month due to financial constraints.  Family History  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases on his mother’s side. His mother died at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction  and his elder brother was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was managed surgically. No other significant family health issues were reported.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis  The initial EKG displayed non-specific ST and T wave changes. Blood tests  including troponin levels and D-dimer assay  were conducted. The D-dimer levels were significantly elevated. Further imaging studies  including a CT angiogram of the thorax  confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection (Stanford Type A).  Management Plan  Due to the severity and type of aortic dissection  Mr. J.A. was promptly scheduled for emergency surgical repair. His hypertension was managed aggressively to keep his blood pressure at a stable level before the surgery. His case was discussed with a multidisciplinary team  and he will require continuous monitoring and follow-up appointments to manage his chronic conditions and prevent potential complications.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of aortic dissection  a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. It also highlights the challenge of managing chronic diseases amid financial constraints  prompting the necessity for more viable healthcare solutions.
Aortic Dissection,9,27,"Patient Presentation  Name: John Doe Age: 66 years Race: Caucasian Gender: Male Occupation: Retired engineer  Clinical History: Mr. Doe is a 66 year old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that was described as sharp and """"tearing"""" in nature  radiating to his back. The pain started while he was lifting a heavy object at his home. He also reported feelings of nausea and shortness of breath. He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was a smoker for over 30 years  although he quit five years ago.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Doe appeared anxious and in pain. His blood pressure was elevated at 172/98 mmHg and heart rate was rapid at 105 bpm. He had dissimilar pulses and blood pressures in extremities. Auscultation of the chest revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency.  Diagnostic Assessment: An EKG showed non-specific ST segment changes. Urgent CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta (Type A) which is an emergency situation.  Family History: Mr. Doe's older brother  aged 70 years  had a myocardial infarction two years ago  and his father had passed away from a stroke at the age of 75 years. There is no known family history of connective tissue disorders.  Course of Treatment: Mr. Doe was immediately started on IV beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure and to control his heart rate. After multidisciplinary discussion  he was rushed to the operating theatre for definitive surgical repair under cardiopulmonary bypass  given that his dissection involved the ascending aorta and the functional impairment of his aortic valve suggested by a diastolic murmur.  Prognostic Outlook: Type A aortic dissection is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate  particularly if left untreated. With the surgery and close post-operative care  the immediate prognosis can be considerably improved. It's expected that Mr. Doe will follow a prescribed regimen of anti-hypertensives and lipid-lowering agent along with lifestyle modifications including low salt  low cholesterol diet and encouragement to maintain regular physical activity. Regular echocardiography follow-up at six  twelve months  and annually thereafter to monitor for aneurysm development and other complications is advised.   Patient Teaching: Mr. Doe and his family were educated on the seriousness of his condition and the importance of medication compliance  lifestyle modifications and regular echocardiogram follow ups to prevent recurrence and complications. They were also advised on signs of possible recurrence like sudden severe chest or back pain and to immediately seek medical attention.    Ethical Consideration: Privacy and confidentiality of the patient was maintained throughout the process. Mr. Doe gave informed consent for all procedures and was included in decision-making processes. Family members were also actively involved  as per Mr. Doe's wishes."
Aortic Dissection,9,28,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old African American male  Mr. Johnson  who presented with sudden severe chest pain that started 2 hours before coming to the hospital. The pain was described as a tearing sensation that radiated to the back.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension along with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is also a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but with a cumulative 25-pack year smoking history. Mr. Johnson was also obese  with a BMI of 31.1. Additionally  the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease  stage 3.  Presenting Symptoms:  Along with the chest pain  he also complained of nausea  shortness of breath  and faintness. Upon examination  Mr. Johnson was noted to be in distress  his blood pressures in his arms were different (right arm 160/95  left arm 150/80)  and his pulse rate was 78 beats per minute.   Family History:  Mr. Johnson’s father died of a heart condition when he was in his early 70s  but specifics were not known. His mother died at 88 of natural causes. He has no siblings or children.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A chest radiograph was immediately performed  revealing widened mediastinum. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was done that confirmed the presence of an ascending aortic dissection. Evidence of a dissection flap starting just above the aortic valve extending up to the beginning of the left subclavian artery was noted.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on IV beta-blockers for hypertension. He was emergently taken to the operating room for surgical repair involving a Bentall procedure and was subsequently moved to the ICU post-operation.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition  often presenting with severe chest pain. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  and certain genetic conditions. It is known to be most common in males between the ages of 60 and 80  with a study noting higher rates of incidence in African American populations. Different blood pressures in arms and widened mediastinum on imaging can be red flags for diagnosing aortic dissection. Aggressive control of blood pressure and surgical management for ascending aortic dissection remains the mainstay of treatment.  References:  This case represents a typical presentation of aortic dissection. A 2010 study in Circulation showed that African Americans have the highest hospitalization rate due to aortic dissection. Further  the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) identifies hypertension  smoking  and a history of cardiac disease as significant risk factors  which our patient has. 
Aortic Dissection,9,29,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient: Mr. Thompson  Demographics:  Age: 67 years old  Gender: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired Policeman  Residency: Boston  Massachusetts.  Presenting Complaint:   Mr. Thompson presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain radiating to the back  accompanied by nausea and profuse sweating. The pain was sudden in onset  began while he was having his morning coffee  has lasted for more than 2 hours  and hasn't relieved despite taking his as-needed medication for heart-related chest pain.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has carried a diagnosis of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for ten years. Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus and tobacco use. He is on regular medication for his chronic conditions  including Lisinopril  Metformin  and a statin. He has a history of non-compliance with his medication regimen and an erratic follow-up with a primary care doctor over the years. A history of mild heart attack was noted five years ago.  Family History:  Family history reveals Mr. Thompson's father passed away due to myocardial infarction in his sixties. His elder brother has a history of hypertension and aortic aneurysm.  Physical Examination:  On arrival  Mr. Thompson was in obvious distress but conscious and oriented. He had a blood pressure of 190/100 mm Hg  a pulse of 108 bpm  respiratory rate: 22 per minute; temperature: 98.6 F. Cardiac examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur suggestive of possible aortic regurgitation.  Investigations:  An EKG showed non-specific ST-T wave changes but no clear signs of ischemia or infarction. According to the clinical symptoms and family history  a CT angiogram was ordered and revealed an aortic dissection beginning just after the aortic arch and extending into the descending aorta.  Treatment and Progress:  Mr. Thompson was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside to lower his blood pressure and heart rate and was urgently transferred to cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of repair. His postoperative course was uneventful  and he was discharged from the hospital on the 8th postoperative day.  Discussion:  The case highlights the importance of thorough investigation in patients presenting with chest pain  particularly when features do not match the typical presentation for more common conditions such as myocardial infarction. The Importance of risk factor control  notably hypertension  cannot be overemphasized. Furthermore  the role of family history in predicting cardiovascular disease is also underscored.  References:   According to the literature  male predominance and advanced age are common in aortic dissection. HTN is the most prevalent risk factor  and African American ethnicity tends to represent a higher risk for the disease (Clouse et al.  2004).  Reference:  Clouse  W. D.  Hallett  J. W.  Schaff  H.

He is married  has two children  a retired army veteran  with a previous history of smoking. He served the military for 25 years but has been largely sedentary since then.   Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history  with hyperlipidemia and high blood pressure  for which he has been on treatment for approximately twelve years. He took his medications irregularly and presented a poor medication compliance history. He quit smoking post-retirement (~10 years)  but he has a 20 pack-year smoking history from earlier years. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  Family History: His family history is significant. His father had a myocardial infarction at 68 and later suffered from a stroke. The patient's mother is alive and suffers from hypertension and diabetes. His sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. OP comes to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to his back  which he rates as 10/10 in severity. He noticed the sudden onset of pain after lifting some heavy boxes in his garage  described as a sharp  tearing pain.  Investigation Results: Upon assessment  his blood pressure is found to be elevated (180/110 mmHg). His ECG shows non-specific ST and T wave changes  but no clear signs of myocardial infarction. His chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. Laboratory results reveal a slight increase in his total cholesterol and LDL levels. Most revealing  a CT angiogram confirms an ascending aortic dissection.  Management: Given his diagnosis of aortic dissection  Mr. Op is immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure and decrease contractility of the heart. This is later followed by surgery (open surgical repair) to repair his aorta.  Summary: This patient presents a complex interplay of factors contributing to his aortic dissection: his age  race  gender  past history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and upper body exertion. His family history of heart disease only increased this risk. His case underscores the importance of proactive disease management and lifestyle changes.   Reference:  Howard  D. P.  et al. (2013).

He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the hospital with acute and severe chest pain that started suddenly.  History of Present Illness: The chest pain began while the patient was performing his usual morning exercise. It was described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping """" and radiated to his back. The pain was not associated with shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. Besides  no changes in consciousness or hemiparesis were reported.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and has been managing it with medication (Lisinopril and Amlodipine) since then. He had been also diagnosed with mild hypercholesterolemia but is not on any lipid-lowering medications at present as his levels are under control via diet modification. He does not have any history of diabetes mellitus. The patient also revealed a history of Marfan syndrome.  Family History: Both of his parents died at an older age from non-cardiovascular causes. However  his older brother died suddenly at the age of 60  which was later determined to be the result of a dissecting aortic aneurysm.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be 165/95 mm Hg and his pulse was 90 beats per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed a diastolic murmur consistent with aortic insufficiency. No other abnormalities were reported.  Differential Diagnosis: Acute aortic dissection  Acute coronary syndrome  Pulmonary embolism.  Hospital Course: The patient underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) that confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection Stanford type A. He was quickly transferred to the cardiovascular surgical unit where he underwent emergency surgery to repair the dissected aorta. The patient showed a good immediate post-operative recovery and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. With a gradual recovery  he was discharged to home after a two week stay in the hospital with a strict follow-up plan.  In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention in aortic dissection to mitigate life-threatening complications. Furthermore  controlling hypertension and regular follow-ups are crucial in patients with a medical and family history of aortic pathology.

Aortic Dissection,9,32,Case Presentation:  Mr. Joseph Brown  a 66-year-old African American male living in an urban neighborhood  presented with a sudden severe sharp pain in his upper back and chest while at rest  described as “tearing” in nature. This pain was accompanied by diaphoresis  dyspnea  and nausea. His past medical history includes uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  hyperlipidemia  and former smoking history of 30-pack years  which ceased 10 years ago. His medication list includes Atorvastatin 40mg once a day and Lisinopril 20mg once a day. He denies any regular exercise or healthy diet and admits he does have a problem with compliance with antihypertensive medications due to the associated side effects.  Mr. Brown has no known allergies. His family history is significant for cardiac diseases  with his father having suffered from coronary artery disease and having undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. His mother died from a stroke at the age of 70. He has 2 siblings  both with histories of hypertension. He has a son and a daughter  both in their 30s with no significant health problems reported.  On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be markedly different in right (156/94mm Hg) and left (130/85mm Hg) upper extremities. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed a regular heart rate without murmurs  normal vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds in the lungs. His abdomen was soft and non-tender  and all peripheral pulses were palpable. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Pulse oximetry showed saturations of 95% in room air.  Considering the acute-onset sharp chest pain with unequal blood pressures  the clinical suspicion of aortic dissection was high. The required diagnostic modality  CT angiography  was done immediately confirming the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection. He was immediately provided with IV beta-blockers  aiming to reduce the heart rate to 60bpm  and pain management strategies. A multidisciplinary 'heart team' decision was made to manage him medically and he was shifted to a high dependency unit for close monitoring.  In conclusion  this case underscores the potential life-threatening nature of aortic dissection and the need for urgent diagnosis and appropriate immediate treatment. It also emphasizes the importance of hypertensive control as a preventive strategy for aortic dissection.

Early recognition and aggressive management are necessary to prevent serious complications like rupture and death.
Aortic Dissection,9,34,Patient Presentation:  The subject is a 60-year-old Asian male patient who presented himself to the Emergency Department with complaints of severe  acute onset chest and back pain which commenced approximately two hours before his arrival. The pain was described as sharp  tearing and radiating from his chest to his back. His medical history reveals that he is a chronic smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history and is also diagnosed with hypertension  poorly controlled  for which he is on medication.  Demographics:  The patient is married  has two children  and works as an engineer. He belongs to a middle socioeconomic class and has health insurance coverage.  Medical History:  He has a history of poorly controlled hypertension for the last ten years  for which he is on an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. Despite medication  his blood pressure levels remain high  possibly due to poor medication adherence and lifestyle factors including high-stress levels and continued smoking.  There was no history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  or renal disease. The patient also has a long history of tobacco use  with no signs of cessation. No history of drug abuse or alcoholism.  Family History:  Patient's family history is significant with his father having passed away from a stroke and his mother suffering from hypertension. He has one older sibling who has coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination and Investigations:  The patient was anxious and appeared acutely ill. He had asymmetric blood pressure readings  higher in the right arm. The carotid  radial and femoral pulses were lower on the left side. A chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram raised suspicion for aortic dissection  and a subsequent CT angiogram confirmed a type A aortic dissection.  Management:  The patient was started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate. Given the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection  surgical intervention was deemed necessary. The patient gave consent  following which  he underwent emergent ascending aortic replacement surgery. Examination of the aortic tissue confirmed the diagnosis.  The patient's postoperative recovery was gradual but uneventful  with gradual improvement of his overall condition. He was discharged with advice on strict blood pressure control  smoking cessation  regular follow-ups  and lifestyle modifications.  This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection as a differential in patients presenting with acute chest or back pain  especially in those with poor blood pressure control and a significant smoking history. Timely diagnosis and intervention are key to improving patient outcomes in such potentially catastrophic conditions. A multidisciplinary approach involving primary care  cardiology  radiology  and cardiothoracic surgery teams is essential to ensuring the best possible patient care.
Aortic Dissection,9,35,Patient Details: Mr. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  an ex-smoker with a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension presented in the emergency department complaining of a sudden and severe chest pain radiating in the back.  Medical History: Mr. J  works as a warehouse operator. He has a known medical history of hypertension for the last ten years but has been inconsistent with his medication  with no other significant health issues. He neither drinks alcohol nor consumes any illicit substances. He has a history of smoking 1 pack per day for 25 years but quit ten years ago.  Family History: There's a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His elder brother (72 years old) was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm two years ago.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J noticed the pain after lifting a heavy box at work. The pain was sudden  sharp  and severe  described as tearing or ripping. He initially thought he had a muscle strain. However  the pain started intensifying and was different from any pain he had felt before  causing him to seek immediate medical attention.  Examination: Upon examination  the patient was anxious  his blood pressure was recorded to be higher on the right arm than the left arm. He had a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg in the right arm and 160/90 mmHg in the left arm.  Diagnostic Results: A contrast CT scan of the chest  abdomen  and pelvis showed Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the iliac arteries. Transthoracic echocardiogram also confirmed aortic dissection. There were no signs of occlusive malperfusion syndrome  or branch vessel occlusion. The laboratory parameters were all within normal limits  except raised d-dimer.  Management: Mr. J was promptly started on intravenous labetalol to control the blood pressure  aiming for a systolic pressure of 100-120 mmHg. Emergency cardiovascular surgery consultation was made  considering the diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency. He successfully underwent repair with supracoronary aortic replacement.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a potentially fatal condition and must be detected and treated promptly. Adequately controlled hypertension is paramount  and patients must be educated about the importance of regular control of blood pressure. This case highlights the need for immediate imaging in patients presenting with a history of hypertension and sudden severe chest or back pain. 
Aortic Dissection,9,36,Case Presentation:  Demographic Information:  The subject is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He is a retired bus driver and currently resides with his wife in the suburbs of Atlanta  GA. He has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has been a non-smoker throughout his life and does consume alcohol moderately.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson's health record indicates a history of poorly controlled hypertension  consistent over the last 10 years. He also has Type 2 diabetes and has been on oral hypoglycemic medication for the last 8 years. Other than these conditions  Mr. Johnson has not faced any major health issues. Lately  he has been reporting occasional bouts of indigestion.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases with both his father and paternal uncle dying from myocardial infarctions in their early 60s. His mother suffered from hypertension and died at 75 due to stroke. His older brother is also hypertensive and recently underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Present Illness:  Mr. Johnson presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as 'tearing'  began at rest and has progressively worsened over the last 2 hours.  Clinical Examination: On examination  his blood pressure on the right arm was 190/110mmHg and 170/100mmHg on the left arm. He looked generally unwell. Cardiorespiratory examination revealed no abnormalities but there was a disparity between the pulses in the two arms.  Investigations:  A chest radiograph showed an enlarged mediastinum. High D-Dimer values were also present. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed an aortic dissection  revealing a large intimal flap separating the lumen of the aorta. There were no signs of aortic rupture.  Diagnosis:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Treatment:  As per standard care  Mr. Johnson was urgently managed with blood pressure lowering medications and pain management. In line with the severity of the condition and the presence of risk factors  he was immediately referred for surgery – aortic root replacement or ascending aortic replacement.   Follow-up and Prognosis:  Mr. Johnson is currently recovering postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit. He has a long-term prognosis dependent on his recovery from surgery and ability to control hypertension. His poorly controlled hypertension is of concern and will be actively managed with medications and lifestyle modifications.  Concluding Remarks:  Mr. Johnson's case highlights the critical importance of recognizing acute aortic dissection promptly  given its high mortality rate. It also underscores the need for hypertension control to prevent such life-threatening complications.

He's been working as an accountant for twenty years  living a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He has a history of smoking for the past 35 years and occasional alcohol use. He has a known history of chronic high blood pressure (hypertension) for the past ten years but has been irregular with his medication  claiming to control his BP through diet and exercise. He has no history of illicit drug use.  Family History: Mr. X’s father passed away at the age of 77 from myocardial infarction  and his mother  currently 85 years old  suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension. His older brother  aged 67  underwent treatment for an aortic aneurysm three years ago.  Clinical Presentation: Mr. X presented in the emergency department with severe  stabbing pain in his chest radiating to his back. The pain was sudden in onset and developed while he was at work. He also reported feeling lightheaded with some difficulty in breathing. His blood pressure was noted to be high (180/95 mmHg)  and his heart rate was irregular.   Diagnostic Findings: An urgent EKG showed no signs of myocardial infarction. However  a CT scan of the chest revealed an aortic dissection type A  involving the ascending aorta. Laboratory results including complete blood count  renal function  and electrolytes were within normal limits apart from slightly elevated troponin levels.  Management: Mr. X was promptly started on intravenous antihypertensive therapy. He was efficiently stabilized and taken for an emergency surgical repair of the dissected aorta. His post-operative recovery was uneventful  and he was adequately counselled about the importance of regular medication  lifestyle modifications  and strict blood pressure control.  Upon discharge  he was referred to a cardiologist for follow-up and a dietician to assist in dietary treatments to help control his hypertension.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing aortic dissection's clinical symptoms and the crucial role of immediate diagnostic intervention and management. High-risk patients need regular follow-ups and should be educated about aortic dissection's potential complications. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this life-threatening condition.
Aortic Dissection,9,38,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 69-year-old African American male who experienced sudden-onset  severe chest pain radiating to the back while gardening. The pain was described as 'tearing' and was associated with sweating and shortness of breath.  Demographics & Family History:  African Americans have a higher incidence of hypertension  which is a major risk factor for aortic dissection. The prevalence is particularly high in males over age 60  which fits the patient's profile. The patient is retired  a widower with 2 adult children  and lives in an urban environment. He has no family history of cardiovascular disease.  Past Medical History:  The patient is a former smoker (he quit 15 years ago upon his physician's advice)  occasional alcohol user  and is known to have uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  treated irregularly with Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). His last recorded blood pressure was four months ago at a routine check-up  with a reading of 165/95 mmHg. He has no history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  kidney disease  or any other chronic diseases.  Emergency Department (ED) Findings:  Upon arrival  the patient looked pale  dyspneic  and was in obvious distress. Vital signs were temperature 36.9°C  blood pressure 190/110 mmHg in the right arm  pulse 105/min  and respiratory rate 24/min. Electrocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. Chest X-ray showed widened mediastinum. Labs revealed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes.  An emergency computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection  Stanford type A  extending from the aortic root to the proximal part of the left subclavian artery. The main coronary arteries were not involved. The patient was promptly taken to the operating room for surgical intervention.  The patient illustrates the importance of recognizing the signs of aortic dissection  especially in high-risk populations such as older  hypertensive African American males. This case also underscores the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors like hypertension and smoking in a timely and consistent manner.
Aortic Dissection,9,39,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Eduardo Sanchez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male living in the urban area of Los Angeles  was diagnosed with a type A aortic dissection. He presented initially with sudden chest pain radiating to his back  along with mild symptoms of nausea and dizziness.   Demographics:  Mr. Sanchez was a retired construction worker. He is married with four grown children. His ethnicity is particularly relevant due to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the Hispanic community  influenced by both genetic factors and lifestyle choices  such as rich traditional food and resistance to engagement in regular physical activities.  Previous Medical History:  Mr. Sanchez has been hypertensive for the past twelve years  for which he was prescribed medications  but his control has been suboptimal. He was also diagnosed with type II diabetes and hyperlipidemia five years ago. Mr. Sanchez is an ex-smoker and quit smoking ten years ago after a mild stroke. He drinks occasionally but has no history of substance abuse. Records showed that Mr. Sanchez had undergone a hernia repair operation 15 years ago  but no other surgical history was noted.   Family History:  His father died at 54 from an unspecified heart disease  and his mother passed away at 77 from stroke complications. His elder brother  who is 71  was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm two years ago. The prominent family history of cardiovascular diseases raises Mr. Sanchez's risk for aortic dissection  especially in conjunction with his own history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes.  Investigations:  His blood pressure on presentation was elevated to 185/100 mmHg. His pulse rate was regular with a rate of 100 beats/minute. The results show high blood sugar levels and an elevated creatinine. A D-dimer test was positive. The chest x-ray showed a widened mediastinum. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the ascending aorta.  Diagnosis and Management:  Based on the clinical presentation  investigative reports  and family history  a diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection was made. Given the emergent nature of the disease  this patient required urgent surgical intervention. A multidisciplinary clinical team was formed swiftly  including a cardiologist  a cardiothoracic surgeon  and an anesthesiologist to manage this life-threatening event. The patient was started on intravenous labetalol for tight blood pressure control preoperatively. He was counseled regarding the situation and the need for immediate surgery  to which he willingly consented.    
Aortic Dissection,9,40,Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: The patient is Mr. W  a 65-year-old African American male  retired from his job as a security guard. He lives with his wife of 40 years in the urban city of Chicago  Illinois.   Presenting Condition: Mr. W presented at the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as 'tearing' in nature and of sudden onset while at home. He also reported mild dyspnea but no other symptoms. He has been feeling well prior to this event and was engaged in his daily activities.  Past Medical History: Mr. W has a history of hypertension  controlled with amlodipine  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with atorvastatin. He was a smoker for 30 years  but quit 10 years ago. He has a moderate alcohol intake  consuming beer once or twice a week. He has no known drug allergies. His immunizations are updated.  Family History: His father died at 70 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  and his mother passed away from breast cancer at 72. He has two brothers  one with hypertension and one with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no family history of strokes or migraines.  Initial Diagnosis: Heavy suspicion for aortic dissection was determined from Mr. W's clinical presentation and history. An immediate CT Aortogram confirmed Type B aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending down to the level of his kidneys.  Treatment Plan: With respect to Mr. W's suitable risk factors for surgical treatment  he was promptly transferred to the surgical unit for an endovascular repair procedure. In addition  his hypertension will be managed with beta-blockers.   This case of Mr. W demonstrates an instance of aortic dissection  often under-diagnosed due to its nature of mimicking other health conditions. Risk factors such as hypertension  age  male gender  and a history of smoking were present in this patient. It's critical to have a high degree of suspicion for aortic dissection when the 'classic' symptoms present  such as in Mr. W’s case.  Note: This presentation is a fictitious case created based on average demographic and medical facts from related published literature. No actual patient of this case representation exists. 
Aortic Dissection,9,41,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jackson is a 65-year-old African American male who came into the emergency department with severe  central chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as 'tearing' and started suddenly. His blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg in the right arm and 155/85 mmHg in the left  signifying a significant difference greater than 20 mmHg that raised suspicion for an aortic dissection.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has a medical history of chronic hypertension (which he was diagnosed with ten years prior) and moderate hyperlipidemia; both conditions are managed with medication. The patient also occasionally smokes cigarettes but rarely drinks alcohol. His medical history also includes type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he's been using metformin for the past 5 years.  Family History:  His father died from stroke at the age of 73  and his mother is alive and well at 93. Mr. Jackson's family history reveals no known genetic disorders  but his older brother  aged 74  had an aortic aneurysm which was surgically repaired five years ago.  Review of Systems:  As per the review of systems  Mr. Jackson has been experiencing some shortness of breath over the past few weeks  but he did not seek medical attention assuming it was due to his age. He denied any abdominal pain  palpitations  sweating  nausea  or vomiting.  Physical Exam:  On cardiovascular examination  he presented normal heart sounds  but the exam was notable for a diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space. No abdominal bruit was heard. His extremities showed no signs of peripheral vascular disease.  Investigations:  An urgent CT angiography showed an acute Stanford type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the aortic arch. His hematological and biochemical markers including total counts  differential counts  renal parameters  liver function tests  and coagulation profile were within normal limits except for elevated HbA1c suggesting imperfect glycemic control over the past few months. An EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without any acute ischemic changes.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is often prevalent in males and those above 60 years of age. Risk factors associated include hypertension  smoking  and atherosclerosis. The disease also shows a greater predilection in African American individuals  highlighting the need for prompt identification and management in these high-risk groups. Mr. Jackson's ethnicity  age  hypertension  and a family history of aortic aneurysm puts him in the high-risk group for aortic dissection.  Mr. Jackson was started on intravenous beta-blockers on admission to control his high blood pressure  which along with his pain  is a significant risk factor for aortic dissections. Emergency surgical referral was arranged  considering his Stanford type A classification which typically requires surgical intervention. His diabetes was also discussed  aiming to optimize his HbA1c levels.  His case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis for patients with severe chest or back pain  especially when associated with differences in upper extremity blood pressures. The case also highlights the needs for rigorous and regular control of chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes as a part of a comprehensive disease management strategy to avoid such emergent situations.
Aortic Dissection,9,42,"Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. John Doe  Age: 62 years old  Sex: Male   Nationality: African-American  Occupation: Retired auto mechanic  The patient presented in the emergency room complaining of sudden  intense chest pain radiating to his back  akin to a sensation of """"tearing."""" The patient reported an onset of pain whilst lifting heavy objects around his garage.  The patient's medical history includes hypertension for which he has been taking beta-blockers for the last 15 years. He is also diagnosed with atherosclerosis for which he is supposed to be on a regimen of aspirin and cholesterol-lowering drugs but admits non-adherence to his medication routine.   There is no significant history of congenital heart defects or inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis within his medical history.   Patient's family history reveals that his father had a history of untreated hypertension and died at the age of 65 from a stroke. His oldest brother  who is 67 years old  also suffers from high blood pressure but is well-managed with medication therapy.  The patient is a former smoker  averaging about a half pack a day for 30 years  but quit at 50. He drinks alcohol occasionally and does not exercise regularly.  Upon physical examination  an aortic murmur can be heard through auscultation along with unequal radial pulses. His blood pressure readings show a variation using his right and left arms. His right arm reading shows a systolic pressure of 165 mmHg and the left arm shows a reading of 148 mmHg. Other symptoms include cold  pale legs and signs of shock including sweating  paleness  and an increased heart rate.  Given the notable symptoms  an immediate CT scan is ordered and confirmed the suspicion of aortic dissection.  Note: Mr Doe’s case is representative of the typical demographics of an aortic dissection patient. According to the literature  men  particularly those over the age of 60  have a higher propensity for this condition. The African-American population is also at higher risk and hypertension is virtually always a factor  in addition to smoking. Non-adherence to medication is a common issue that exacerbates the risk."
Aortic Dissection,9,43,Patient Presentation:  Presenting is Mr. Thomas G  a 70-year-old African American male who is a retired army veteran. He arrived at the emergency department complaining of severe and acute chest pain  radiating to his back. His medical history indicates hypertension for over 15 years  during which he has been irregular with his medications. Furthermore  he is a former smoker with a 40-pack-a-year history but quit smoking ten years ago. His BMI categorizes him as overweight. Additionally  he has an extensive family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died from a fatal stroke at the age of 75. He does not have diabetes and his lipid profile has been normal consistently.  He denies any recent trauma  significant falls  or remarkable physical exertion preceding the chest pain. He reported experiencing bouts of nausea and lightheadedness  but denied symptoms of cough  fever  shortness of breath  palpitations  or swelling of legs.  Physical Examination:  Mr. Thomas looked anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed high blood pressure (182/98 mmHg)  rapid pulse (105 bpm)  respiratory rate was normal (16 breaths/min)  and his body temperature was normal (98.7°F). Heart sounds were normal but a low-grade murmur was noted. Upper body pulses were symmetrical  but femoral pulses were weak. There was no peripheral edema or cyanosis.  Investigations:  An EKG initially showed ST-segment changes suggestive of ischemia. A chest radiograph indicated an abnormal mediastinal widening. Urgently  a CT angiography was conducted  which confirmed the presence of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection originating few centimeters above the aortic valve and extending to the right common iliac artery.  Treatment & Prognosis:  Given the nature of the dissection  an urgent surgical consultation was sought. The surgical team recommended immediate surgical intervention to prevent any fatal complications like aortic rupture. This included replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with a composite graft. After the successful surgical procedure  Mr. Thomas was transferred to the cardiovascular intensive care unit for close monitoring. He received medication to maintain his blood pressure at desirable levels and prevent complications. He was advised regarding lifestyle modifications  regular follow-ups  and the importance of medication adherence.  In conclusion  given Mr. Thomas' age  history of hypertension  and family history of heart disease  he falls within the population demographic most likely diagnosed with aortic dissection  more prevalent in older  hypertensive males  particularly those of African American ethnicity according to the reported literature. This case demonstrates the importance of proactive management and awareness of associated risk factors in mitigating the complications of this life-threatening condition. 
Aortic Dissection,9,44,Patient Profile:  Mr. R is a 58-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain. The pain is described as an acute onset of a tearing sensation in the upper back that radiates to the chest.   Past Medical History:  Mr. R has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ten years ago. He also had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) five years ago. He is on Metformin for his diabetes and Atenolol for his blood pressure. His medication compliance has been inconsistent according to his primary care doctor's notes.  Family History:  Mr. R’s family history reveals his father died in his early sixties from a stroke  and his mother in her late seventies from complications associated with diabetes. His older brother  in his mid-sixties  was diagnosed with heart disease and underwent a triple bypass surgery about two years ago. There is no known genetic disorder in his immediate family.   Social History:  Mr. R is a seasoned marketing executive living in the urban setting of Chicago with his spouse. He is a former smoker  having quit five years ago  post his myocardial infarction. However  he continues to consume alcohol moderately and has a relatively sedentary lifestyle. There is no known drug abuse.   Physical Examination: Upon initial evaluation  Mr. R appears anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs are remarkable for blood pressure of 210/120 mm Hg. Heart rate is 98 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur.   Given the patient’s symptoms  history of hypertension  and the physical exam findings  a differential diagnosis of aortic dissection was considered. A CT aortogram was performed revealing a type A aortic dissection. He was subsequently referred for emergent surgical consultation.  This case presentation represents an aortic dissection  which is more common in males and among those aged 50-70 years. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  and a family history of vascular diseases. The significant aspect of this case is the association of aortic dissection with uncontrolled hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular disease. Prompt diagnosis and management can help improve the outcome in such cases.
Aortic Dissection,9,45,Patient Presentation: Mr. S  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as tearing and ripping  10/10 on the pain scale. The patient looked pale and was sweaty. His medical history revealed that he has been suffering from uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years and follows a consistent smoking habit. He denied any illicit drug abuse. He refuses medication or medical advice often  due to previously existing mistrust towards the medical field.   Father died at 58 due to a cardiac event  mother is alive and has hypertension  diabetes  and a history of stroke. His older brother suffered from an aortic rupture at 60 years of age. There is no known familial connective tissue disease. Patient has three adult children  all of whom are healthy.   Clinical Examination & Diagnosis: Mr. S’s blood pressure was found to be 220/120 mmHg  pulse 110/min  and respiratory rate was 22/min. Upon physical examination  he was found to have a difference of 20 mmHg in blood pressure between his right and left arms and a diastolic murmur was evident.  An immediate CT scan was conducted  which confirmed the Type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Management: Mr. S was immediately started on intravenous labetalol to lower his high blood pressure. In concert with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery consults  he was promptly taken to surgery for an emergency aortic dissection repair. Post-surgery  Mr. S was moved to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He was started on a long-term medication plan of beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril)  and statins (atorvastatin). Smoking cessation and hypertension management was discussed with him and his family.  Follow-up: Mr. S's recovery was monitored over several weeks. He showed compliance with his treatment regimen  did stop smoking  and his BP was controlled around 130/80 mmHg. Furthermore  his family was advised to get screened for potential aortic diseases due to the history of aortic rupture in the brother and now aortic dissection in the patient.  Risk and Prognosis: Uncontrolled hypertension and smoking are the major risk factors that potentially led to aortic dissection in Mr. S. Although Mr. S underwent successful surgical repair of his aorta  he remains at high risk for aneurysm development or recurrent dissection  especially since he has a family history of aortic pathology. Hence  control of hypertension  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups are crucial components of the long-term care of Mr. S.   This case of Mr. S illustrates aortic dissection in an African American male with uncontrolled hypertension and significant familial cardiovascular history  which coincides with demographics commonly associated with higher risk in medical literature.
Aortic Dissection,9,46,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Z  a 64-year-old male  presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back. The patient described the pain as 'tearing' and of sudden onset. On arrival  his blood pressure was 170/95 mmHg  pulse rate was 100 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. He had a BMI of 28 and reported shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Z has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years and type II diabetes mellitus. Despite being on antihypertensive medications  compliance was questionable due to missed doses. He had been a smoker for 15 years but quit 10 years ago. Mr. Z is also diagnosed with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but had no routine follow-ups and treatment for COPD.  Family History:  The patient’s father died from a stroke at the age of 76  and his mother died from complications related to diabetes. He has two brothers  one of whom had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Clinical Intervention:  On suspecting aortic dissection based on the nature of pain and his medical history  a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered that confirmed the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection. The patient was immediately started on medication to lower his blood pressure and heart rate. He was admitted into the ICU for close monitoring. Vascular surgery was consulted  who suggested managing the patient's case medically  considering the patient's age and the type of dissection.  Conclusion:  Aortic dissections are a surgical emergency and are associated with high mortality rates. They are commonly seen in patients like Mr. Z  with uncontrolled hypertension and a history of smoking. It is crucial to manage these patients swiftly and accurately to prevent fatal complications. Management of such cases highlights the significance of strict blood pressure control  particularly in patients with known risk factors. In addition to surgical intervention  ensuring medication compliance and effective heath education for patients with chronic diseases like hypertension is of paramount importance.   References: 1.

Aortic Dissection,9,47,Patient Identification: Mr. J is a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of sudden severe sharp pain in his chest area that radiated to his back. He rates the pain at 9/10 in intensity.  Past Medical History: Mr. J's past medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been non-compliant with his anti-hypertensive and lipid lowering medications. Other medical history includes obesity and a 20 pack-year smoking history.  Family History: His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father died from a myocardial infarction and his elder brother has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. J was found to be anxious  diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg in his right arm and 160/95 mmHg in the left arm. Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormal sounds  and his respiratory examination was unremarkable aside from mild tachypnea.  Diagnostic Findings: An electrocardiogram (ECG) ruled out acute myocardial infarction. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. A subsequent Computerized Tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed an ascending aortic dissection.  Treatment: Mr. J was immediately referred for surgical repair. His medications were revised to strictly control his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Smoking cessation programs and lifestyle modifications were emphasized for him.  Discussion: Mr. J's demographic aligns with the common age group (65-70 years) for aortic dissection as reported in literature. Hypertension  particularly uncontrolled  in conjunction with the patient's smoking history forms the significant risk factors for the development of his condition. His family history of cardiovascular disease could suggest a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis and arterial damage  predisposing him further to the condition. This case presentation highlights the importance of strict control of hypertension  smoking cessation  and medication compliance among such patients.
Aortic Dissection,9,48,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old African American male presenting to the Emergency Department with a sudden and severe onset of chest pain. The pain is described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" in nature and is radiating through to his back. He reports feeling extremely anxious  weak  and diaphoretic. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea and dizziness. He denies any calf pain or erythema  recent trauma or falls.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension which he self-reports as being poorly compliant with prescribed antihypertensive medication. Additionally  he has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 5 years ago. Other significant history includes a myocardial infarction (MI) about 10 years back and an ongoing treatment for Type II Diabetes Mellitus. He doesn’t report any known drug allergies.   Family History:  The patient's mother died at an early age from a cerebrovascular accident  and his father died of a myocardial infarction. His only sibling  a younger brother  has been diagnosed with hypertension and suffers from chronic kidney disease.  Social History:  He is retired but had a previous occupation as a truck driver. He consumed moderate amounts of alcohol in the past but quit approximately the same time when he quit smoking. He lives alone in a rural area.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient is in moderate distress. His blood pressure is significantly higher in his right arm compared to his left. Auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the right sternal border. The remainder of the exam is noncontributory  revealing no abdominal or flank tenderness or evidence of peripheral vascular disease.  Initial Diagnostic Assessment:  The EKG shows no clear signs of ischemia or any other acute changes. Blood tests  chest x-ray and CT angiogram confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The dissection involved the ascending aorta and was therefore classified as a Stanford type A dissection. His blood test reports were significant for a mildly elevated D-dimer and a moderate rise in the troponin level.   Case Conclusion:  This patient's advanced age  hypertension  history of smoking and heart disease provide a substantial likelihood of an aortic dissection. He was immediately sent for a cardiothoracic surgery consult and was taken for emergent repair of the dissection to prevent fatal complications such as aortic rupture and cardiac tamponade. "

Aortic Dissection,9,51,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Identifiers/Demographics:  Mr. Johnson  a retired Caucasian man of 68 years residing in Southern California  presented with sharp chest pain radiating to his back.   Past Medical History: He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years. Other relevant past medical history includes evidence of atherosclerosis  smoking (30 pack-years)  obesity (BMI 34)  and a stressful life event - retirement from his occupation a few months ago.  Presentation: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department complaining of an acute severe chest pain that began while he was gardening. The pain was sudden  sharp  and severe in intensity  and it radiated to his back. He also reported mild dyspnea but denied any symptoms of faint  nausea  vomiting or sweating. His blood pressure measurement revealed a reading of 180/90 mmHg.  Family History: Mr. Johnson's father died at 70 due to heart disease  and his mother succumbed to complications due to stroke at 73. His older brother had suffered from a myocardial infarction at 67.   Workup and Diagnosis: With a suspicion of aortic dissection  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of his chest was conducted  which confirmed the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection. Other significant findings included mild coronary artery disease and aged pulmonary effusion.  Management: Given the emergent nature of the diagnosis  Mr. Johnson was immediately taken to the operating room for surgical intervention. The post-surgical period was uneventful  and he was discharged a week after the operation with strict instructions for controlling his blood pressure  improving his lifestyle  and adhering to regular follow-ups.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a serious condition often linked with hypertension  smoking  and atherosclerosis. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest or back pain  especially in the context of an elevated blood pressure and relevant personal and family medical history.

Aortic Dissection,9,52,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 55-year-old Caucasian male from the Southeastern United States who presents with severe  sudden onset chest pain that radiates to his back and a sensation of """"tearing."""" He was brought to the emergency department (ED) by his wife  who reported noticing that her husband appeared suddenly unwell  perspiring profusely  and had difficulty breathing.  Patient History:  Mr. J has a known history of hypertension and smoking. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past ten years but reports having difficulty in compliance due to medication side-effects. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He does not have a history of diabetes or any other cardiovascular disease. The patient’s father died of a heart attack at the age of 59  and his mother is currently living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Physical Examination:  On initial evaluation  Mr. J was hypotensive  with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. His heart rate was irregular at 110 beats per minute  and his oxygen saturation was 88% on room air  necessitating supplemental oxygen. Mr. J appeared anxious  sweaty  and pale  and there was evidence of distal limb ischemia. A difference in blood pressure was noted between the right and left arms.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  An immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiogram performed in the ED demonstrated intimal flap in the ascending aorta  suggesting an aortic dissection. Furthermore  chest X-ray showed widening of the mediastinum. A D-dimer test was significantly elevated. Laboratory tests also showed increased white cell counts and serum troponin levels.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation and echocardiographic evidence  Mr. J was diagnosed with a Stanford type A aortic dissection. It is a medical emergency that necessitates urgent surgical intervention.   Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce his blood pressure and heart rate. He was referred to a cardiovascular surgeon and was taken to the operating theatre urgently for aortic root replacement surgery.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with sudden onset  severe chest or back pain  especially in a high-risk population such as those with poorly controlled hypertension and smoking history. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are key factors influencing the outcome in aortic dissection.  In this case presentation  considerable effort was made to include accurate demographic representation and relevant patient information  so as to provide accurate context for the diagnosis and management of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,9,53,"Patient Presentation  Patient Information:   A 60-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe chest pain  described as a """"ripping"""" and """"tearing"""" sensation. The pain radiated to his back. He has a known medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  a smoking habit of 20-pack years  and previous history of cocaine misuse. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle with a high-stress job and has a BMI of 28. His father died of a heart attack at 64 and his mother had a stroke at 67.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  he exhibited an elevated blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg with pulse rate of 90 beats per minute. Blood pressure in the right and left arms differed by 30 mmHg  supporting a diagnosis of aortic dissection. Upon auscultation  a diastolic murmur was noted  indicative of aortic regurgitation. He appeared in discomfort  anxious  and sweaty.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An emergency transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a suspicious intimal flap in the descending thoracic aorta  satisfying the criteria for Stanford Type B. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal ruling out acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) with no signs of ST elevation or Q waves. His chest X-ray showed an enlarged mediastinum. Blood tests including full blood count  renal function tests and troponin were normal. A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of an acute aortic dissection originating from the descending aorta and extending to the level of renal arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:   He was immediately administered intravenous beta-blockers to manage hypertension and pain. An aggressive antihypertensive regimen was initiated with sodium nitroprusside infusion. Stat consultation with cardiovascular surgery was requested  but due to the Type B dissection (starting after the left subclavian artery)  a conservative approach was preferred over surgical management unless complications arise such as rupture or malperfusion.  Follow-up and Outcomes:   The patient's pain was well-controlled with analgesics and strict blood pressure control was achieved with medications. He was discharged after 10 days with recommendations for lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol consumption  along with strict blood pressure control in outpatient follow-up. He was educated about the warning signs of complications and advised to follow up regularly.   Discussion:  Aortic dissection is an uncommon but catastrophic cardiovascular event. Men are affected twice as much as women and African Americans have the highest incidence rate  especially those with elevated blood pressure. Risk factors in our patient included age  gender  race  hypertension  and a lifestyle that involved cocaine use and smoking.   Despite being an emergency  aortic dissection can demonstrate a wide range of signs and symptoms. A high index of suspicion along with timely management can significantly reduce the mortality associated with this condition.   This case highlights the importance of adhering to risk factor reduction in patients with uncontrolled hypertension to prevent such catastrophic events in susceptible individuals. Regular follow-up  patient education and lifestyle modifications are an essential part of patient management."
Aortic Dissection,9,54,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Raúl Gomez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as tearing and began two hours prior to visit.  Background Information:  Patient is retired from his work as a construction worker  currently living with his wife. He is a former tobacco smoker  having quit five years ago after smoking 40 pack years. He drinks alcohol occasionally. He denies any illicit drug use. He is obese with a BMI of 34.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of poorly managed hypertension. Despite being prescribed medication  his compliance has been inconsistent. He also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin  but has suboptimal glycemic control. His history also includes hypercholesterolemia.  Family History:  His father had an ischemic stroke at the age of 75 and mother had type 2 diabetes. His older brother died from myocardial infarction at the age of 64. There is no known family history of connective tissue disease.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his blood pressure was significantly higher in his right arm vs his left (200/130 mmHg vs 150/95 mmHg). His pulse was 110 beats per minute and regular. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur heard best in the right upper sternal border. Neurological examination was normal.   Diagnostic assessment: Based on the history  physical examination  and his risk factors  a tentative diagnosis of aortic dissection was made. CT angiogram was performed which confirmed Type A (DeBakey Type II) aortic dissection. Blood tests revealed raised D-dimer levels.  He was started on intravenous beta blockers to manage his blood pressure and heart rate. He was deemed a surgical candidate and underwent successful ascending aortic replacement.   Overall  despite several risk factors including hypertension  smoking  and diabetes  the patient's aortic dissection remained undiagnosed until the acute onset of symptoms  reinforcing the importance of regular follow-ups and health check-ups in patients with high risk for cardiovascular diseases.  Follow-Up: Post-surgery  the patient was recommended to engage in a cardiac rehabilitation program to optimize his cardiovascular health and continue managing his other chronic conditions. Furthermore  increased adherence to antihypertensive medication was reinforced. He was counselled on maintaining a healthy diet  weight management  and regular exercise to manage his comorbidities. His family was suggested to undergo screenings due to the potential genetic risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Aortic Dissection,9,55,Patient Presentation  Patient: Mr. J. Anderson Age: 61 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Marital Status: Married Occupation: Retired Mechanical Engineer   Chief Complaint: Sudden and severe chest pain.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. Anderson presents with sudden-onset  severe chest pain that started while he was mowing the lawn. The pain radiates to his back and is described as a tearing sensation. He also appears pale and is profusely sweating.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Anderson has a significant history of hypertension for 15 years  which is summarily controlled with oral antihypertensives. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus five years ago. He has also undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 3 years back due to ischemic heart disease. No known allergies. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years  consuming approximately 20 cigarettes per day.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction. His mother  diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes  passed away at 73. He has one elder sister who is currently battling breast cancer. His two children are healthy.  Physical Examination:  Initial BP: 200/110 mmHg on left arm  160/98 mmHg on the right arm. Pulse: 105 bpm. Breathing rate: 18 breaths per minute. He was alert and orientated  but quite anxious. Heart sounds are normal with no murmur heard. Lung fields clear bilaterally. No abdominal or lower limb abnormalities noted.  Investigations:  ECG shows no signs of acute myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray reports a wide mediastinum. A Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TOE) and a Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram confirmed the type B aortic dissection. Blood works showed an increased WBC count and slightly elevated troponin levels.  Assessment & Plan:  Mr. Anderson is diagnosed with a type B aortic dissection likely related to his long-standing poorly-controlled hypertension complicated by his smoking history. An urgent referral to cardiothoracic surgery was made. The patient is kept on antihypertensive medications (beta-blockers  ACE-inhibitors) to manage the blood pressure aggressively. Also  adequate pain management and regular monitoring have been initiated.  Plan of care includes cessation of smoking and better control of hypertension and diabetes. Rehabilitative intervention and genetic counseling for other family members may also be considered  given the history of cardiovascular problems in his family.  Literature Review:  Aortic dissection commonly affects men between 60 to 70 years of age and is strongly associated with hypertension  making Mr. Anderson's case typical (Crawford  2006). Tobacco use  as in this case  can synergistically increase the risk alongside hypertension (Goldfinger et al.  2014). A family history of vascular diseases is also a risk factor (Hiratzka et al.  2010). Therefore  Mr. Anderson's comprehensive case is indicative of demographic and risk factor representation for this condition as found in literature. 
Aortic Dissection,9,56,"Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. James Wilson  is a 68-year-old African American male  living in an urban area. He is a retired school teacher and lives with his wife. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidemia (high blood levels of fats)  both of which have been managed with medications for the last 15 years.  Mr. Wilson reported sudden severe chest and back pain that he described as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping """" which began at rest while watching television at home. He also reported feeling light-headed and short of breath. He has no known allergies  does not smoke  and drinks alcohol occasionally. His father passed away at an early age from a heart attack and his mother has diabetes. They were both hypertensive.  On examination  his blood pressure was notably higher in the right arm compared to the left. Investigations using chest x-ray revealed that his mediastinum was widened  and an electrocardiogram (ECG) ruled out myocardial infarction (heart attack).  He was immediately taken for computed tomography (CT) angiogram which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The dissection was identified to begin just after the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down to the abdominal aorta (Type B Aortic dissection).  Given his stable condition and the type of dissection  the patient was medically managed with medications to control his blood pressure. He was admitted to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and closely monitored.  Throughout his admission  the patient and his family were educated regarding the seriousness of his condition and the importance of blood pressure control to lower the risk of further aortic dissection.  This case underlines the vital role of early diagnosis and immediate management of aortic dissection to prevent catastrophic events. With appropriate and timely intervention  the prognosis for patients like Mr. Wilson can be significantly improved. Continuing monitoring and control of hypertension are important for preventing an adverse event in the future."
Aortic Dissection,9,57,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain described as ripping and radiating to the back. He had a history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and was a life-long smoker. He did not have any records of regular medical check-ups and it was his first hospital visit in years. Mr. Rodriguez had a BMI of 28 and a past medical history of high cholesterol. However  he had no history of surgeries or other known health conditions. His family history was notable for a father who underwent surgery for aortic valve disease in his late 70s.   On examination  his blood pressure was elevated with asymmetrical readings between both arms. Pulse was palpable but weak and irregular. Normal breath sounds were present in all lung fields. No murmur  gallops  or rubs were detected on cardiac auscultation. Extremities were cool to touch bilaterally.  Work-up and Diagnosis:  Due to the nature of his symptoms and a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension  a suspicion of aortic dissection was made. An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a Stanford Type B aortic dissection extending from the left subclavian artery to the level of the superior mesenteric artery  confirming our suspicion. The client's laboratory results revealed a slightly elevated D-dimer level.  Treatment and Follow-up:  Mr. Rodriguez was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensives to bring down the blood pressure and prevent further propagation of the dissection. The cardiology team was looped in for further management and decided to proceed with non-surgical management owing to the type and location of the dissection. He may be a candidate for endovascular repair if the dissection grows larger over time or if complications arise. A plan was made for close follow-ups with cardiology and strict blood pressure control.  Discussion:  Mr. Rodriguez’s case is a typical example of aortic dissection  a life-threatening diagnosis that frequently presents in emergency departments. Males are more susceptible  especially in the age group of 60-70 years. Hypertension remains the most significant risk factor  followed by smoking  as in this case. Family history of aortic disease also increases the risk as seen in Mr. Rodriguez’s history. Prompt recognition and patient management is critical to survival  where rapid diagnosis  frequent examination  and early initiation of therapy or surgical intervention when needed  can be life-saving. 
Aortic Dissection,9,58,Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He is a lifetime smoker  and his family has a significant history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died prematurely of a myocardial infarction. Mr. Smith works as a high-stress finance job  has a history of hypertension  and has a BMI indicative of obesity.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith visited the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain. The pain was severe  described as tearing that radiated to his back. He also reported feeling nauseous and was noticeably sweating profusely.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension  for which he has been inconsistent in taking his prescribed antihypertensives. He has a history of smoking 1 pack/day for the last 40 years and a previous history of high cholesterol treated with statins. However  he stopped using statins one year ago of his own accord. To his knowledge  he does not have any known allergies.   Family History: Besides his father's premature death due to myocardial infarction  his mother had a stroke in her late 70s. His older brother  aged 65  currently has coronary artery disease and had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft procedure two years ago.  Pertinent Clinical Findings: Upon examination  his blood pressure was found asymmetrically high in his right arm compared to his left and heart rate was 110 bpm. The pain remained unaltered with changes in position or during the Valsalva maneuver. Lab tests showed elevated levels of D-dimer. An echocardiogram and computed tomographic angiography confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  with a tear in the ascending aorta.  Treatment and Progress: Mr. Smith was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive medication to control his blood pressure. He was taken to the operating room and underwent emergent surgical repair  whereupon an aortic graft was successfully placed without any immediate complications. Post-operative recovery will include medication to manage high blood pressure and cholesterol  lifestyle modifications  smoking cessation  and regular follow-ups with a cardiologist.  Education and Counseling: Mr. Smith was educated about the importance of adhering to his medication regimen and maintaining his blood pressure within the normal range. He was also informed about the importance of quitting smoking and recommended a weight management plan to lose weight sensibly. Dietary changes  including reducing salt and fat intake  were emphasized. Consequently  he was encouraged to engage in regular moderate-intensity exercise  aiming for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week  pending physician's approval.  Follow Up: Upon discharge  he is to continue with his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs and participate in ongoing monitoring of his health status. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled with his cardiologist within the next two weeks.   Outlook: The patient’s prognosis will greatly depend on his ability to maintain consistent blood pressure control  adhere to a healthier lifestyle and diet  and his compliance in taking his medications regularly.
Aortic Dissection,9,59,Patient Presentation: Mr. Williams  a 62-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe chest pain which he described as 'tearing' radiating to the back. He is a truck driver by profession.  Past Medical History: Mr. Williams has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years for which he's taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. He also has hyperlipidemia  maintained on Simvastatin 20mg daily. He is a smoker for more than 35 years  smoking approximately one pack daily  and consumes alcohol occasionally.   Family History: His father died from a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at the age of 50. His mother is alive and diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes.  Examination in ED: On arrival  his blood pressure was found to be significantly high: 200/110 mmHg  pulse rate 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Upon physical examination  he was sweating  appeared anxious  complaining of pain intensity escalating to a ‘9 out of 10’.  Diagnostic Assessment: A CT angiogram was done urgently which confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection beginning just above the aortic valve and extending up to the point where the arteries supplying the brain split off. The left ventricle was normal in size and function  no signs of myocardial infarction were present.   Hospitalization and Treatment: Due to the critical nature of his condition  Mr. Williams was admitted to the cardiac care unit. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted  and he was immediately taken to the operating room for an emergency ascending aortic dissection repair. Post-operatively  he was started on a strict blood pressure management protocol to maintain systolic BP between 100-120mmHg. He was also given Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation counseling.  In the light of the patient's racial background  it's important to note that studies have shown that African Americans have higher rates of hypertension  which if uncontrolled increases the risk of acute aortic dissection. It's recommended that effective BP control and lifestyle modifications are needed for such patients.   This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with a history of hypertension presenting with excruciating chest pain. Thus for Mr. Williams  immediate and accurate diagnosis along with surgical intervention were life-saving.  Patient Education and Follow-Up: Mr. Williams will require lifelong antihypertensive medications and should aim to maintain a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg. Regular follow-ups with his cardiologist every three months are necessary to monitor his health condition. In line with clinical guidelines  he'll be advised on smoking cessation  diet change  and regular exercise. Furthermore  his first-degree relatives are recommended for hypertension and cardiovascular risk factor screening given the family history.
Aortic Dissection,9,60,"Patient Presentation  Mr. John Davis  a 67-year-old African American male from Houston  Texas  visited our Emergency Department (ED) presenting sharp  tearing chest pain that had migrated to his back over a 2-hour period. Mr. Davis rated his distress level at an 8 on a pain scale of 10  with ten representing the most severe pain. He described his pain as """"sharp"""" and """"tearing """" which intensified with movement and alleviated slightly upon reclining.  Medical History  Mr. Davis has a 10-year history of hypertension but only adheres to his medication sporadically due to financial constraints. He also was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes five years ago  which he manages with diet and a once-daily oral hypoglycemic agent. No documented history of high cholesterol  asthma  or heart disease. He is a former smoker  with a 20 pack-year history and ceased smoking ten years ago. He's not a regular alcohol consumer but has a history of moderate alcohol use in his younger years.  Family History  Mr. Davis’ father passed away at 72 due to myocardial infarction  while his mother died at 65 due to stroke. His older brother  age 72  is currently being treated for coronary artery disease. The patient has two children  both in good health.  Laboratory Tests  Upon initial examination  Mr. Davis’ vital signs showed a blood pressure reading of 180/120 mm Hg  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute  and SpO2 of 92% on room air.  The ECG study presented ST segment changes  but no clear evidence of myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of d-dimers. A CT scan showed an intimal flap located in the ascending aorta; thus  confirming the diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Management  Mr. Davis was immediately started on antihypertensive medication. Furosemide was given for emergency blood pressure control  along with beta-blocker metoprolol  chosen for its proven efficacy in aortic dissection cases. As this condition falls into a surgical emergency  Cardiothoracic surgery had been arranged urgently.  Summarization  Mr. Davis represents a fairly prototypical example of a patient with aortic dissection  considering his age  gender  and race. Literature suggests that aortic dissection is more prevalent among men aged 60 to 70 years and is found to be relatively higher in the African American community. In line with this  hypertension remains the most common risk factor in almost 75% of cases  just as in Mr. Davis' situation  making his case an example of typical demographic presentation."
Aortic Dissection,9,61,Patient Profile:  Mr. Richard is a 65-year old Caucasian man who presently resides in Chicago  Illinois. He is a retired engineer  his body mass index indicates that he is slightly overweight  and he has a history of smoking about 15 cigarettes daily for 40 years. He has hypertension which had been poorly controlled. He has no known allergies. Richard has been a widower for 8 years and has two children  both are healthy and live independent lives. He admits to an alcohol intake of around 2 drinks daily.  Chief Complaint:  Richard was rushed to the ER complaining of severe and sudden onset of chest and abdominal pain.  Medical History:  Richard has a past medical history that includes poorly controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a result of his smoking habit  and Type 2 Diabetes. He is currently on Lisinopril for the hypertension  Statins for hyperlipidemia  Metformin for Diabetes  and Salmeterol for COPD.  Presenting Condition:  Given Richard's reported sudden onset chest and abdominal pain  hypertension history  and chest x-ray results  an aortic dissection was suspected. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan confirmed the diagnosis: a Type B  distal  aortic dissection. The affected aorta starts at the level of the left subclavian artery and extends down to the bifurcation of the aorta. The true lumen is compressed and there is partial thrombosis of the false lumen.  Family History:  Richard reported that his father died from a myocardial infarction in his 70's  and his older sister  now 70  is living with ischemic heart disease and hypertension. However  there is no family history of aortic dissection  aneurysm  or any genetic connective tissue diseases like Marfan's Syndrome.  Social History:  Richard leads an inactive lifestyle  spending most of his time doing sedentary activities. He has a poor diet that is high in fat and sodium. He also has moderate alcohol consumption.  Impression:  Richard's poorly controlled hypertension likely contributed to his development of aortic dissection. His smoking habit and sedentary lifestyle also place him at further risk of complications. The family history of cardiovascular diseases raises the possibility of a genetic predisposition  but in the absence of a family history of aortic dissection  this may not be a significant factor in his case.  This case highlights the need for effective blood pressure control  alongside lifestyle modifications such as diet improvement  exercise  smoking cessation  and moderate alcohol consumption. Prolonged hypertension  if not managed  can lead to severe complications like aortic dissection. Furthermore  immediate medical attention and possibly surgical intervention are crucial to manage aortic dissection and prevent life-threatening complications.
Aortic Dissection,9,62,Patient Profile: “Mr. Romero”  Patient Background Mr. Romero is a 65-year-old Hispanic male who resides in an urban residence in the southern United States. He is a retired construction worker with a history of chain smoking for over 30 years. He has recently quit smoking for the past two years. However  he continues to consume alcohol moderately. His BMI shows that he is overweight  but not obese.  Presenting Problem Mr. Romero presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden  severe chest pain that radiated to his back and dyspnea. The pain was described as “tearing” and had worsened over a period of few hours.   Medical History Mr. Romero has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus that have been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and metformin  respectively  but he has been non-compliant with medications and follow-up appointments due to financial and transportation issues.   Family history Apart from his sister diagnosed with hypertension  there are no significant illnesses that run in the family.   Investigations and Diagnosis Given his symptomatology and medical history  an immediate CT scan was conducted that revealed an intimal flap in his thoracic aorta  confirming the diagnosis of an aortic dissection. Further echocardiography revealed an ascending aorta dissection (Type A).  Management and Follow-up Mr. Romero was immediately started on IV beta-blockers (esmolol) and vasodilators (sodium nitroprusside) to control his blood pressure and alleviate the mechanical stress on the aortic wall. Due to the nature of his condition and considering the risks involved  Mr. Romero was referred for an emergency surgical intervention - open repair of the ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement with aortic graft.  After surgery  Mr. Romero was closely monitored in the ICU setting. His pain  blood pressure  and heart rate were gradually stabilized over the first 24 hours. He was instructed to continue his blood pressure medications and to attend regular follow-ups with his primary caregiver. Mr. Romero was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences similar chest pain in the future.  Public Health Implications Aortic dissection is an emergency condition that requires immediate medical attention. Though quite rare  it tends to occur more frequently in men than in women and the risk increases with age. Uncontrolled hypertension is a significant risk factor  and this case emphasizes the urgent need to address hypertension management  particularly in underserved communities where access to healthcare and health literacy may be limited. Education on the necessity of regular health check-ups  medication compliance and lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  regular physical activity  and alcohol moderation must be provided to reduce the risk of such cardiovascular events.
Aortic Dissection,9,63,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male  referred to the emergency department for severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as 'tearing' and it has been gradually worsening over the past few hours.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension  with poor medication adherence. He was diagnosed with moderate atherosclerosis at the age of 60 and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 50 years. His other past medical history includes hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Family History:  The patient’s father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother died of a stroke at age 65. His brother  two years elder  underwent a coronary artery bypass surgery and his sister was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes. All his siblings are still alive.  Social History:  He is a retired automobile mechanic  is married with four children. His wife is a hypertensive and diabetic too. He smokes but does not consume alcohol.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient had weak pulses in his right radial artery compared with his left. His pulse was 110 per minute  blood pressure was 180/100 mm Hg  body mass index was 30.2 kg/m2  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. He appeared sweaty  anxious and in distress.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  His emergent electrocardiogram did not show signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram evidenced an evaluation of aortic dissection. A follow-up Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed confirming a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Treatment and Prognosis:  He was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to decrease his blood pressure and reduce the shearing force on the aorta. He was rushed to surgery for emergency aortic repair. A more aggressive post-op BP control plan was decided for him given his extensive family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is more common in males above 60 years of age  with a higher prevalence in African Americans. In this patient  his long history of smoking  hypertension  atherosclerosis  hyperlipidaemia  and family history of cardiovascular diseases constituted the risk factors for his development of aortic dissection. The clinical presentation simulates that of a myocardial infarction  which often leads to delay in diagnosis and treatment. 
Aortic Dissection,9,64,Patient Presentation  Patient’s Initials: K.L. Age: 65 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Presenting Problem:   Mr. KL recently visited the ER with severe  sharp chest pain which radiated to his back. His heart rate was elevated  and he showed signs of high blood pressure. The initial ECG was unclear  but a CT scan confirmed an aortic dissection.  Past Medical History:  He was diagnosed with chronic hypertension twenty years ago but was non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications. He admits to an unhealthy diet  a sedentary lifestyle  and smoking. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. He has no known allergies.   Family History:  His family history is significant for hypertension and heart disease. His father died from heart failure  and his mother had a stroke.  Social History:  He is a retired construction worker  divorced for the last ten years  and has two grown children. He lives alone and admits to having a hard time quitting smoking  despite numerous attempts.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  his vitals showed a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed asymmetrical pulses and a diastolic heart murmur.  Diagnostic Findings:  The CT angiogram showed a dissection starting just above the aortic arch (Stanford Type A). It also indicated a moderate pericardial effusion and coronary artery disease. Elevated troponin level indicated myocardial involvement.   Treatment:   Given the patient's clinical condition  he immediately underwent emergent cardiac surgery  where a synthetic graft was used to repair the dissection. He was also started on a beta-blocker to better control his hypertension.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that mainly affects men in their 60s and 70s with hypertension being the major risk factor. This case underscores important points: the need for regular medical follow-ups  compliance with medication  lifestyle modifications  and early detection of potential consequent diseases associated with hypertension.   Conclusion:  Despite the patient's success in managing his aortic dissection  it's important to recognise the overall management of his health for long-term success. Hypertension control  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups for his cardiac status are essential to mitigate further potential complications like heart failure  stroke  or renal failure.
Aortic Dissection,9,65,"Patient Presentation   Patient Information:  A 65-year-old Hispanic male  a retired construction worker with a history of hypertension and smoking (30 pack-years)  presented to the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain.  Clinical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which was moderately controlled with medication. He followed a poor diet and continued smoking  despite doctors' repeated advice to quit. He reported being relatively active  participating in light physical activities.  Present Illness: The patient stated that he suddenly felt a sharp  severe pain in the chest that seemed to radiate to the back. He described the pain as a feeling of """"tearing"""" in his chest. The pain started while he was lifting a heavy object at home. Fearing a heart attack  his wife immediately brought him to the emergency department.  Physical Examination: The patient was visibly distressed  diaphoretic (excessive sweating)  and had an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) with observed difference in blood pressure readings between arms. No other abnormalities were noted on examination.  Investigations: An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show typical signs of myocardial infarction (heart attack)  which directed suspicion towards other conditions. Bloodwork was remarkable for mild renal dysfunction and elevated D-dimer levels. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered which demonstrated an aortic dissection beginning just after the aortic valve and extending into the descending thoracic aorta.  Family History: The patient's father died in his 70s from complications of a stroke  and his mother lived into her 80s with hypertension and diabetes. He has no siblings.   Discussion: Aortic dissection is a critical condition that often presents with sharp tearing chest pain. Hypertension  advanced age  and smoking are high-risk factors for aortic dissection. Among racial and ethnic groups in the United States  aortic dissection is more common in non-Hispanic white men rather than Hispanic men. However  the onset in Hispanic men population is not uncommon.   Immediate management of this case included controlling blood pressure and heart rate  and immediate surgical consultation for a potential aortic repair procedure. The patient's hypertension  lifestyle choices  and neglect towards medical advice seemed to have contributed significantly to his current condition. "

His father died at the age of 70 due to heart failure and his mother suffered from hypertension. One of Mr. S's two elder siblings has type 2 diabetes  and the other has no known health conditions.  Physical Examination: On arrival  his blood pressure was significantly higher (BP=190/110mmHg). He was conscious  alert  but showed signs of distress due to severe pain. Electrocardiogram was normal. His pulses were palpable and equal in both the upper and lower limbs.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels but normal cardiac enzymes. An urgent computerized tomography (CT) angiogram confirmed the presence of aortic dissection starting just after the origin of the left subclavian artery extending to the iliac arteries bilaterally.  Management: Mr. S was immediately managed with pain control and antihypertensive medications to reduce BP and was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for emergent surgery consideration.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition  often presented as severe chest pain with radiation. Factors contributing to this condition in our patient may include chronic uncontrolled hypertension coupled with his history of myocardial infarction and high cholesterol. Asian populations  particularly men  are shown to have a higher incidence of aortic dissection. This case emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring and effective management of cardiovascular risk factors  particularly hypertension.
Aortic Dissection,9,67,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile - Sex – Male Age – 69 years Race – Caucasian Residence – Urban  Occupation - Retired Engineer  Family History -  The patient has a family history of heart disease. His father passed away due to myocardial infarction in his 70s  and his sister has been diagnosed with hypertension.   Past Medical History -  The patient had long standing uncontrolled hypertension and a known history of smoking and occasional alcohol intake. Two years prior  he was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient was rushed to the ER with sudden  severe chest pain that developed at rest  described as tearing and radiating to the back. He also complained about shortness of breath.  Investigations: Upon examination  the blood pressure reading in his right arm was notably higher than his left. His heart rhythm was normal  but a diastolic murmur was noted. An EKG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. A chest X-ray revealed widened mediastinum. A CT angiogram was urgently done which confirmed the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta.  Management: Immediately  antihypertensive medication was administered to decrease blood pressure and heart rate. The patient was then transferred for emergency cardiothoracic surgical intervention as required for Type A aortic dissections.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a serious condition where there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  leading to separation of layers  forming a secondary channel of blood flow within the vessel wall. Risk factors include hypertension  connective tissue disorders  aortic stenosis  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol. Although aortic dissections can occur at any age  the patient's demographic (older  male  Caucasian) is typically more at risk according to literature. Early diagnosis and treatment  as in this case  is crucial for survival.   In this case  the patient's previous history of hypertension and aortic stenosis  along with his lifestyle choices  notably increased his risk of aortic dissection. Shared decision-making with patients is critical in personalizing care  including risk factor modifications  and planning for close surveillance for new or worsening symptoms. 
Aortic Dissection,9,68,Patient Profile: M.K. is a 65-year-old African American male residing in Cook County  Chicago. He lives with his wife and retired from his job as a school principal 3 years ago. M.K. is a non-smoker but had consumed alcohol socially throughout his life. He has a sedentary lifestyle and has a history of poor dietary choices  leaning towards foods high in cholesterol and fats.  Medical History: M.K. has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia that were diagnosed 10 years ago. However  he has poor adherence to prescribed medications and visits to his primary care provider are sporadic. He has no history of surgeries or other significant diseases.  Presenting Issue: M.K. presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe  tearing chest pain which started approximately 2 hours prior to arrival.  Family History: M.K.'s father died of a stroke at 72  and his mother died at 67 due to complications related to diabetes and HTN. He has one older sister who is alive at 68 and receiving treatment for breast cancer. There is no known family history of aortic disease.  Examination: On examination  M.K had unequal blood pressure readings in his arms along with a pulse deficit. Auscultation revealed an early diastolic murmur. His EKG showed no signs of myocardial infarction.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's history  physical examination  and initial imaging findings  a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made. Types A (involving the ascending aorta  regardless of where the initial tear is located) and B (not involving the ascending aorta) are the two types based on the Stanford classification system. In M.K.'s case  he was diagnosed with Type A aortic dissection.  Treatment and Prognosis: An emergent surgery is planned to repair the ascending aorta and aortic valve. M.K. is being started on beta blockers to control his blood pressure prior to surgery. The overall prognosis largely depends on the patient's age  underlying comorbidities  and the extent and type of aortic dissection.   The above case represents a rather typical aortic dissection case based on demographics with a higher prevalence among older males  African Americans  and those with hypertension.
Aortic Dissection,9,69,Subject: Case Presentation (Aortic Dissection)  Patient Profile: Mr. Robert Sanders  a 58-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department complaining of severe  sudden chest pain radiating to his back. He is a long-term resident of Chicago  Illinois  and is an active member of his community. He is married and has two adult children.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension for the last 15 years  which is partially controlled by medication (Losartan 50mg daily). He has type II diabetes mellitus under control with Metformin 1000mg twice daily. He also has a 35-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking five years ago. He had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) six months ago but did not have any permanent neurological deficits. He has no history of surgeries.  Family History: His father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and his mother is a survivor of stroke. He has one brother who has no significant health issues. His older sister has hypertension and diabetes mellitus. There's no known family history of connective tissue disorders.  Examination and Investigations: On examination  Mr. Sanders appeared to be in severe pain. His blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg  heart rate 100 bpm  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Physical exam was significant for asymmetrical pulses between the upper limbs. The rest of the physical investigation was untravelled.    An urgent CT Angiogram revealed an aortic dissection originating just above the aortic valve and extending to the abdominal aorta. ECG showed no signs of ischemia or infarction. Complete blood count  electrolytes  kidney function  and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.  Management and Outcome:  Mr. Sanders was immediately started on intravenous labetalol with a target to lower his systolic blood pressure to below 120mmHg. He was swiftly transferred to the Cardiothoracic Unit for emergency surgery. The surgery was successful with no intraoperative complications.   He was transferred to the ICU for postoperative management. On the third postoperative day  he was transitioned to the medical floor and was deemed stable for discharge on the eighth postoperative day with close monitoring and outpatient follow-ups scheduled.   Conclusion: Mr. Sanders' case underscores the significance of prompt diagnosis and aggressive management of aortic dissection  especially among patients with multiple risk factors  such as hypertension  smoking history  and family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Regular follow-ups were advised  especially focusing on strict blood pressure control and management of his diabetes to avoid complications. He was strongly advised to adhere to his medication and lead a healthy lifestyle to lessen the risk of complications in the future.   This case also serves as a reminder for clinicians to consider aortic dissection in differential diagnosis when patients present with acute chest pain  especially when they have ongoing hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. 
Aortic Dissection,9,70,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. B  Age/Sex: 65/Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Civil Servant  Presenting Problem: Mr. B arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest and back pain which began 2 hours prior to presentation. He described the pain as tearing and radiating to his back. He also reported feeling lightheaded  but denied any loss of consciousness  nausea  or shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mr. B has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  and he recently discontinued his anti-hypertensive medication  lisinopril  due to perceived side effects. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes 5 years ago  currently managed by metformin. Additionally  there’s a record of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years; though he admitted trying to quit several times  he has not been successful.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 73 and his mother lived to be 80 but suffered from coronary artery disease. He has one brother who is still alive and suffered a myocardial infarction in his late fifties.   Physical Examination: On initial examination  Mr. B appeared to be in severe distress secondary to pain. His blood pressure was 200/115 mmHg  heart rate was 98 beats/min  and his respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. There was a discrepancy in blood pressure reading between his two arms. During examination  there were no clinical findings of pulse deficit  neurological deficits or murmur.   Investigations: A subsequent computerized tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a Stanford Type A aortic dissection beginning just above the aortic valve and extending into the descending aorta. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC)  electrolytes  creatinine and cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits except for elevated blood glucose levels.  Plan: Mr. B was emergently transferred to cardiovascular surgery for an ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement given the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection. The patient's hypertension and diabetes are to be managed more aggressively postoperatively  with referral to a dietician and social work for smoking cessation help.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition most commonly associated with hypertension. The classic presentation is sudden onset severe chest or back pain with a ripping or tearing quality. This case underscores the importance of pain characterization and taking a thorough history in the evaluation of chest pain  as these features led to a more comprehensive work-up for aortic dissection. Evidence suggests that Caucasian males  particularly those with uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history and a family history of cardiovascular diseases  are more susceptible to aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,9,71,Patient Presentation: Patient N is a 68-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain that radiated to his back. He described the pain as tearing and sharp. He has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed with medication for 15 years. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but quit 15 years ago. There is a family history of aortic aneurysm noted in his father  who died suddenly at the age of 69.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient's blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg  and there was a difference in blood pressure between his right and left arms (more than 20 mmHg)  and an early diastolic murmur was heard on the left sternal border. There were no other significant physical findings.   Tests and Investigations: An electrocardiogram showed no signs of myocardial infarction. To confirm the suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered  which showed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the proximal aortic arch.  Diagnosis: Based on his symptoms  clinical findings  and CTA imaging results  Patient N was diagnosed with a type A aortic dissection. This severe condition puts him at higher risk of complications like rupture of the aorta that can lead to life-threatening bleeding  organ damage due to lack of blood flow  stroke  or heart failure.  Plan & Treatment: Given the diagnosis of a Stanford type A dissection  the patient was immediately referred for surgical intervention to prevent potential aortic rupture. Postoperatively  strict blood pressure control will be initiated to prevent extension of the dissection. Surveillance imaging will also be part of his ongoing management  to monitor the status of the aorta over time.  Discussion: Aortic dissection has a high mortality rate if left untreated  and hypertension is a significant risk factor. African-American individuals  as well as male gender  have been identified in the literature as demographic risk factors for aortic dissection. Furthermore  genetics also play a role  as evident in this case where the patient had a family history of aortic aneurysm. Long term management focuses on controlling blood pressure and regular follow-up imaging. It's also essential to educate the patient regarding the importance of maintaining strict control over his blood pressure and cholesterol level  avoiding tobacco use  and attending regular follow-up visits.
Aortic Dissection,9,72,Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Demographic: A 60-year-old African-American male Occupation: Retired truck driver Initial presentation: Sudden severe chest and back pain described as tearing or ripping  Personal Medical History: He is a known hypertensive for 20 years and has been non-compliant with his anti-hypertensive medication  Losartan. He also has a 30-year history of smoking two packs a day  consuming alcohol moderately  and a sedentary lifestyle. No history of diabetes  asthma  tuberculosis  or any surgeries.  Family History: There is a significant history of cardiovascular disease in his family  his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 52  and his older brother was diagnosed with a stroke at 55.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  there was a significant difference in the blood pressure readings between the right and left arms. Furthermore  exam revealed early signs of an aortic regurgitation murmur  indicating worsening aortic dissection. He had slightly diminished pulses in his lower extremities as well.  Diagnostic Tests: Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with no ST changes. Chest x-ray demonstrated mediastinal widening. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a type A (ascending) aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the iliac arteries.  Risk Factors: The risk factors in this case are long-standing hypertension  smoking  advanced age  male gender  African American ethnicity  and family history of cardiovascular disease.   This case represents the typical demographic in aortic dissection as shown in the literature; most patients are men (about 65% of cases)  mean age of around 63 years  with hypertension being the most prominent risk factor found in 70% - 90% of the patients. Smoking and African-American ethnicity also correlate with higher rates of aortic disease  including dissection.  Management: The patient was admitted immediately to cardiovascular surgery for an urgent aortic root replacement given that he had a Type A aortic dissection  which if untreated can have a mortality rate as high as 50% within the first 48 hours.  *Please note: This is a fictional case based on known risk factors and demographics for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,9,73,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anderson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with sudden severe pain in the upper back and interscapular area  characterized as ‘tearing’ or ‘ripping.’ Along with the pain  he also experiences poor general condition  sweating  nausea  and dizziness but no shortness of breath or chest pain.  Past History: Mr. Anderson is known to have a long-standing history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the years. He was advised to take anti-hypertensive medications (Calcium Channel Blockers and ACE inhibitors) but has been non-compliant and negligent in his dietary and lifestyle modifications. He also has a history of tobacco and alcohol addiction but quit smoking ten years back. There is no history of recent trauma or surgical interventions.  Family History: His father had passed away due to myocardial infarction at 68  while his mother is diagnosed with Type II diabetes. He has one younger brother who is in good health. There is no known history of connective tissue disorders or other hereditary diseases in the family.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  blood pressure in his right arm was 180/120 mm Hg while in the left arm it was 165/110 mm Hg. Pulse rates were symmetric in both arms  and no audible murmur was heard. Neurological examination discovered no abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed immediately  revealing a dissection flap in the ascending aorta.  Diagnostic Assessment: A CT angiogram confirmed an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta (Stanford type A). Blood tests displayed elevated D-dimer levels.  Management: Being an emergent clinical condition  Mr. Anderson was rushed for immediate surgical intervention  involving graft replacement of the ascending aorta  to prevent life-threatening complications such as aortic rupture  organ failure due to impaired blood supply  or cardiac tamponade. Post-surgery  he was initiated on aggressive blood pressure control therapy with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers to maintain his systolic pressure below 120 mm Hg.  This case emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring and adequate control of hypertension  and the compliance with anti-hypertensive treatment  as they significantly contribute to preventing aortic dissection. It also underscores the importance of immediate diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention in preventing fatal complications associated with aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,9,74,Patient Presentation:  Mr. M.S  a 68-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department (ED) with chief complaints of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back  shortness of breath  and diaphoresis.   Past Medical History:  Tracing his past medical history  Mr. M.S is a known hypertensive and diabetic  with both conditions being poorly controlled due to non-compliance with medications and lifestyle modification. He had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago  but has had no follow-up cardiology appointments since then. He also has a 40-year pack history of smoking and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 5 years ago.  Family History:  Concerning family history  his father died from a stroke aged 60  and his older brother had a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 63. His mother is alive at 90 years old with no known heart disease.   Demographics:  Mr. M.S is a retired automotive worker  is widowed with two adult children  and lives alone. He is insured through Medicare. He has a significant history of non-compliance with appointments and treatments due his transportation challenges and distrust in the healthcare system.   Clinical Finding:  Upon initial vitals check-up  his blood pressure was high at 185/109mmHg  heart rate was fast at 110 bpm  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation was relatively normal at 97% on room air.   Based on his symptoms  history  and demographics  the ED physician suspected acute aortic dissection  which was confirmed by a computed tomography angiography (CTA) showing an ascending thoracic aortic dissection.   Discussion:  Aortic dissections have a higher prevalence in males and typically affect those over 60 years old. African American men have been shown to have a higher incidence of hypertension  a major risk factor for aortic dissection. Given Mr. M.S's history of hypertension  smoking  peripheral artery disease  and family history of aortic disease  he falls into a high-risk group for aortic dissection. These conditions have likely contributed to the development of his aortic dissection.   Healthcare providers should be cognizant of these added risks in similar patients  prioritizing early detection and intervention. Management of such patients requires a multifaceted approach including not only medical and surgical treatment  but also advocacy for their active participation in healthcare management considering their sociocultural backgrounds. Comprehensive follow-up care with regular checkups and continued education on lifestyle changes  risk factor management  and medication compliance are vital for preventing further health deterioration.
Aortic Dissection,9,75,Patient Presentation  Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male residing in urban New York City. He worked as a truck driver for 35 years and has recently retired.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years and tobacco use  amounting to a pack a day for the last 30 years. He also had Type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 10 years. His father and grandfather both had cardiac related conditions  he also appears to have a family history of heart diseases. In the past  patient used to consume alcohol but gave up few years back.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient comes in complaining of a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest and back pain  radiating to his abdomen and his back for the past several hours. The pain began while eating breakfast today. He also expresses feelings of 'light-headedness'.  Symptoms: On examination  his blood pressure was found to be 200/110 mmHg in the right arm and 170/90 mmHg in the left arm. The patient showed symptoms of respiratory distress and seemed to be in severe pain.   Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of hypertension  the disparity in blood pressure between the two arms  his symptoms  and the nature of his pain  a diagnosis of aortic dissection was considered. A suspicion was elevated by the chest X-ray results indicating mediastinal widening  and a CT Aortogram confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a Stanford Type B Aortic Dissection.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on pain relief medication and intravenous antihypertensive drugs to try to reduce the systolic blood pressure to 100-120 mmHg  as per the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommendations. He was also immediately referred to the cardiothoracic department for further management of his condition.  Note:  It should be recognized that aortic dissection is more common in men  African Americans  and those with a history of uncontrolled hypertension. It is also highly fatal  with a mortality rate of 1.9% per hour following the onset of symptoms until definitive treatment is administered. Hence  it was crucial to manage the patient's blood pressure urgently to prevent his condition from worsening. Patient's family was also counseled about the seriousness of the condition and advised to support him quit smoking.
Aortic Dissection,9,76,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. X is a 62-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe chest pain  described as """"tearing"""" in nature and radiating to his back. The pain was most intense in the anterior chest and started while the patient was lifting a heavy object at his job as a construction worker. He felt clammy  short of breath and also mentioned experiencing feelings of impending doom.  Past Medical History:   Mr. X has several risk factors that put him at risk for aortic dissection. He was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago but has had poor medication adherence due to lack of awareness and socioeconomic constraints. He has a 20-pack year history of tobacco smoking but quit ten years prior to arrival. He does not report any personal history of hypercholesterolemia  diabetes  or any other vascular diseases. There's no known history of drug abuse  specifically no cocaine or other stimulant use.  Family History:  While there is no known family history of Marfan Syndrome or any other connective tissue disorders in his family  his father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 65.  Physical Examination:   Upon examination  he appeared to be in distress  with diaphoresis and labored breathing. Blood pressure was significantly different in the two arms (Right arm- 190/110 mmHg  left arm 160/90 mmHg)  suggestive of arterial occlusion in the left arm. The heart sounds were normal with no audible murmur. Examination of chest and lungs revealed no abnormalities. He was alert  oriented  and without any neurological deficit.  Diagnostic Studies:   EKG was performed which did not show any changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. The D-dimer level was raised. These findings lead to the suspicion of aortic dissection  which was finally confirmed by a Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) revealing a Stanford type A dissection  with involvement of the ascending aorta  arch  and descending thoracic aorta (DeBakey Type II).  Management and Outcome:  Considering the patient's acute condition  the cardio-thoracic surgery team was immediately consulted for emergency surgical repair. The patient was also started cautiously on intravenous beta-blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure in the ED. Despite the risk factors and lack of early intervention  the surgery was successful with no post-operative complications noted. He has now been discharged with optimal medications  including effective antihypertensives and statin therapy  and has an appointment scheduled with cardiology for follow-up.  Take-home Message:   This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in at-risk patients presenting with severe chest pain. Prompt diagnosis and management can significantly improve the outcome in these patients. It also emphasizes the role of preventive care  medication adherence  and risk factor management in cardiovascular health."
Aortic Dissection,9,77,Patient Presentation:  Patient: J.W.  a 58-year-old African American male  Presenting Complaint: Severe sudden onset chest pain  described as 'tearing' in nature  radiating to the back.  Past Medical History: J.W. has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years and has been poorly compliant with his antihypertensive medication. He also has a known history of smoking but quit 3 years ago and has no history of alcohol abuse.   Family History: His father died from a myocardial infarction at 60 years of age  and his mother suffers from chronic hypertension.   Social History: J.W. is married with two children and works as a postman.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  blood pressure is 180/110mmHg in the right arm and 155/95mmHg in the left arm. His heart rate is 100 beats per minute. His respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels are within normal limits. There is a discrepancy in pulse volume between both arms. Cardiovascular exam reveals a harsh systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border.   Investigations: An urgent CT angiography confirms the diagnosis of aortic dissection involving the ascending and descending thoracic aorta (DeBakey Type II). Laboratory results demonstrate slightly elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol  as well as elevated white blood cell count and CRP levels indicative of an inflammatory state.  Management: Given his diagnosis  J.W. is immediately started on medication to control his blood pressure and heart rate  including beta-blockers and nitroprusside. Subsequently  the patient undergoes successful emergency surgery to repair his ascending aorta and replace it with a synthetic graft. He is placed on follow-up for regular checks on the status of his aorta.  Discussion: Aortic dissections are often seen in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hypertension  and the disease has significant morbidity and mortality. High index of suspicion and early diagnosis are crucial to survival. In this case  the diagnosis was facilitated by the patient's severe chest pain  clinical findings suggestive of aortic pathology  and confirmed on CT angiography. Successful management included addressing the hypertension and surgical correction of the dissected aorta.  Ethnic Prevalence: Aortic dissection is relatively common in African American men aged 50-60  with hypertension being a major risk factor. Existing literature indicates that the incidence of aortic dissection is higher in African American individuals as compared to white individuals  even after adjustment for hypertension and other risk factors  suggesting a need for heightened awareness and control of cardiovascular risk factors in this population.
Aortic Dissection,9,78,"Patient Presentation:  Name: John Doe Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Presenting complaint: Severe chest pain that started suddenly and radiated to the back  History of presenting complaint: Mr. Doe presented to the ED with a feeling of """"tearing"""" chest pain radiating to his back. The pain commenced suddenly while he was watching TV at home and has lasted for about 3 hours before the patient arrived at the hospital. There has been no change in the intensity of the pain since it began. He had a similar  though less severe  episode about six months ago which he did not seek medical attention for.  Past Medical History: Hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago  for which he takes Lisinopril. He has a 10-year history of smoking (1 pack per day) and quit about a year ago. There is also a history of high cholesterol for which he is under medication. He had a minor myocardial infarction approximately 10 years ago.  Family History: Father died at the age of 62 from a heart attack; mother has a history of hypertension. His brother  aged 67  was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm two years ago.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is in evident distress and profusely sweating; his blood pressure is found to be elevated (170/110 mmHg in right arm  160/120 mmHg in the left arm). Pulse - irregular rapid pulse observed; Heart sounds were normal. The lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdominal and neurological examination was normal.  Investigations: CT angiography demonstrates a dissection of the ascending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of aortic dissection. His CBC  CMP  Coagulation profile  Cardiac Markers  and Lipid profile were ordered.  Treatment and Management: Mr. Doe was stabilized with IV Beta-blockers to lower the blood pressure and reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Given that the dissection involved the ascending aorta  the patient underwent an emergency surgical repair of his aortic dissection.  Outcomes and Follow-Up: Surgical repair was successful and Mr. Doe was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay in stable condition with follow up appointments with Cardiology and GP for the management of hypertension.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe's smoking history  hypertension status  family history of vascular illnesses and past history of heart disease likely contributed to his incidence of aortic dissection."

He also reports feeling lightheaded.   Past Medical History  His past medical history is notable for untreated hypertension and a 35-year history of smoking  although he quit 10 years ago. He had a prior myocardial infarction 5 years ago  which was managed medically. No allergies were reported.  Demographics   Mr. Rodriguez is a retired teacher living with his wife in an urban area. They are socially active with their family and community. He smokes cigars occasionally and reports moderate  regular alcohol intake. He is a veteran and visits VA for regular check-ups. On examination  his weight is 70kg  with a height of 170 cm  blood pressure of 180/110mmHg in right arm  temperature of 98.5 F  and heart rate 105 bpm.  Family History  Mr. Rodriguez's father passed away from a stroke at 73  while his mother died at 78 due to heart failure. His older sister  68 years old  is currently living with hypertension and coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination & Diagnosis  On physical examination  Mr. Rodriguez looked uncomfortable  with mild distress. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. Pulses were symmetrical in all four extremities. CT scan confirmed a diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection.  Plan and Provisional Diagnosis  Mr. Rodriguez's presentation  coupled with his history of untreated hypertension  raises suspicion of aortic dissection. Arrangements were made for immediate transfer to the cardiothoracic surgery unit for a probable emergency surgical intervention. His wife and children were informed and stayed with him until transfer.  Comment  Aortic dissection is a serious condition  often linked to hypertension. Mr. Rodriguez's venerable age  Hispanic ethnicity  and male gender align with statistical trends for higher incidence of this condition. His history of smoking and coronary artery disease also add to his risk. Quick action and diagnosis are essential for the best patient outcome. This case emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring and control of hypertension. Additionally  it underscores the crucial role of prompt emergency care in managing acute cardiovascular events. Prompt intervention can potentially save lives in the case of aortic dissection.

Case Summary: Mr. X  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and smoking  came into the hospital complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the back. Clinical findings and imaging confirmed a diagnosis of aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.  Patient Management Plan: The condition is considered a surgical emergency due to its ascending nature. The patient was initially managed with pain control and blood pressure lowering therapy  to decrease shear stress on the aortic wall. After stabilization  Mr. X was referred to cardiovascular surgery for definitive management.  Patient Education: Discussed the significant risk factor of tobacco use  hypertension  and the importance of regular medical follow-ups. He was also explained about the potential complications of aortic dissection including heart failure and the risk of rupture leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding. Smoking cessation interventions and hypertension control measures were also discussed for preventing future cardiovascular risks.   This case reiterates the critical aspect of managing modifiable risk factors  especially hypertension and emphasizes the need for patients to be aware of their conditions and participate actively in their care."
Aortic Dissection,9,81,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  currently living in the United States  who was brought to the hospital with severe chest pain which started about three hours before his arrival. He described the pain as sudden  sharp  and “tearing” in nature starting from the center of the chest and radiating towards the back. He also reported episodes of nausea  vomiting  and profuse sweating.  Past Medical History   His past medical history highlights controlled hypertension. He has been on antihypertensives for the last five years. He also signs of early-stage chronic kidney disease.  Family History  The patient's family history includes cardiovascular disease and hypertension in multiple family members. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his older brother had an unspecified aortic aneurysm.  Social History  The patient admits to occasionally drinking alcohol but denies any illicit drug use or smoking. He is married and has three children. He is a retired school teacher living with his wife.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient appeared acutely ill  anxious  and pale. His blood pressure was noted to be 170/100 mm Hg  and pulse was 110 beats per minute (bpm). A loud diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space was noticed during cardiovascular examination.  Investigations  Considering the severity of pain and clinical findings  Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  revealing a type A dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending towards the aortic arch.  Treatment and Progress  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for immediate management of blood pressure. He underwent emergency surgery to repair the dissected aorta. His postoperative course in the ICU was complicated by transient renal insufficiency  but the patient gradually improved over time.    In conclusion  this case presentation details a typical presentation of a lethal condition affecting the geriatric population. High suspicion can facilitate early diagnosis and effective management which are crucial to improving survival in such cases.
Aortic Dissection,9,82,Patient Presentation:  Mr. T. Johnson is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired mechanic  whose primary language is English. He presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden  severe anterior chest pain that radiates to his back and has persisted for about 6 hours. He describes the pain as being tearing in nature. He doesn't smoke or drink and denies any illicit drug use.   Past Medical History:  His medical history includes hypertension which has been under control with medication (amlodipine 10mg daily) since he was diagnosed 10 years ago. Other medical alarming background includes slightly elevated cholesterol for which he takes atorvastatin 20mg. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin. He has no history of allergies.   Family History:  His mother died of a stroke at 72  and his father died in his early sixties due to myocardial infarction. He has one brother who currently has coronary artery disease. None of his family members to his knowledge had aortic disease.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a patient in moderate distress  diaphoretic  with a blood pressure of 190/100 on his right arm and 160/85 on his left arm. The radial pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right. Auscultation of the chest shows a blowing murmur over the aortic area. The rest of the examination is within normal limits.   Lab findings:  Troponin levels were within normal ranges. His CBC  CMP  and HbA1c came out within standard parameters.   Diagnostic Findings:  An immediate ECG was performed which did not show any signs of ischemia or infarction. Due to suspicion of aortic dissection  a CT angiography was requested  revealing an intimal flap in the ascending aorta consistent with a Stanford type A aortic dissection.   Discussion:  Mr. Johnson's presentation is typical of an acute aortic dissection. Risk factors are male sex  older age  high blood pressure  and atherosclerosis. His constant and uncontrollable hypertension is likely the predisposing factor behind this condition.   Plan:  This is a life-threatening condition and calls for immediate surgical intervention. The patient will be admitted to the cardiac surgery service in light of possible aortic dissection repair. In addition to surgery  the patient should commence on medication to lower the systolic blood pressure  thereby decreasing the sheer stress on the aortic wall. His other chronic conditions have to be managed carefully  avoiding a hypoglycemic event in the perioperative period.   Outcome measures:  The efficacy of management will be assessed by the relief of symptoms  stable vital signs  follow-up imaging after surgical treatment  and continual monitoring for complications. After discharge  regular outpatient monitoring is recommended  including imaging surveillance to detect any new or progressive vascular disease.  Patient and family education about the gravity of the situation  emergency signs and symptoms  the necessity for follow-up  and medication adherence are crucial.
Aortic Dissection,9,83,Patient Profile:  Name: George Thompson Age: 65 years Race: Caucasian Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Place: New York  USA  The patient  Mr. George Thompson  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male living in New York City who initially presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain that radiated to his back  with a history of hypertension and smoking.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a controlled history of hypertension over the past 10 years and has been prescribed amlodipine  which he's been taking regularly. Mr. Thompson has been a heavy smoker for the past 35 years and consumed on average a pack a day. He also has a history of high cholesterol  for which he takes simvastatin. He denies any known history of heart disease or peripheral arterial disease.  Family History:  There is no reported family history of aortic dissection  aneurysm  or connective tissue disorder on both paternal and maternal sides. However  his father died of a myocardial infarction at an early age (52) and his mom is diabetic.   Presentation:  The patient complained of excruciating  tearing chest pain that began suddenly while he was reading. The pain radiated to the back and no relief was observed with rest or nitroglycerin. The patient reports no other symptoms.   Physical Examination:  On general examination  he appeared distressed due to pain. Blood pressure is 170/110 mmHg; pulse is 110/min; respiratory rate is 20 breaths per min; body temperature is 37°C. Visualization of the chest showed no visible abnormalities  except the intercostal retractions.  Emergency Diagnosis:  Given the severe  sudden-onset chest discomfort  a range of conditions were considered  including myocardial infarction  pulmonary embolism  and aortic dissection. ECG did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia.  The high resolution CT chest angiography confirmed an ascending aortic dissection starting just above the aortic root  involving the aortic arch and abdominal aorta.  Mr. Thompson was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate and plans were swiftly put in place for his transfer to the cardiothoracic unit for surgical repair of the dissection.  The case of Mr. Thompson represents the typical demographic and risk factors for aortic dissection seen in the literature  including male gender  older age  a history of hypertension  and smoking. This case especially highlights the importance of rapid diagnosis and management in aortic dissection given its high mortality rate.
Aortic Dissection,9,84,Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old African-American male with a medical history of hypertension and smoking  presents to the emergency department (ED). He hails from an urban background  is divorced  and works as a truck driver. He has three adult children  lives alone  and belongs to a lower socioeconomic status. He denies having any other known familial medical conditions.  Case Presentation: Mr. Johnson was previously managed for hypertension but non-compliant with his prescribed medications. He smokes approximately 20 cigarettes a day for the last 40 years. He was brought in with a chief complaint of sudden onset  severe pain in the middle of his chest and between the shoulder blades. The pain is tearing in nature  constant  rates 8/10  and started about 3 hours ago.  On examination  there is a discrepancy in blood pressure measurements on both arms (+20mmHg on the right arm). Mild diaphoresis noted but no signs of heart failure and the lungs are clear. Neurological examination revealing no signs of stroke. He reports no episodes of fainting  no changes in vision  no shortness of breath  and no loss of consciousness.   The electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates left ventricular hypertrophy  but no signs of myocardial infarction. A rapid bedside Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a dilated aortic root which heightens our suspicion of aortic dissection. Subsequently  Computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) confirms the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Family History: Mr. Johnson's father had a history of chronic hypertension and passed away from a stroke in his late 70s. His mother died of breast cancer at 68. His siblings are alive and in good health. No known family history of any inherited connective tissue disorders (e.g.  Marfan's syndrome)  aortic diseases  or other cardiovascular diseases.  Conclusion: Mr. Johnson's situation is typical  as literature reveals that the highest incidence of aortic dissection lies among males in their 60s and 70s  particularly with a background of unmanaged hypertension  smoking  and advanced age. The case emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention in suspected aortic dissection cases  given their potential for severe complications like aortic rupture  cardiac tamponade  or end-organ ischemia. It also brings attention to the necessity of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications in hypertensive patients. The case serves as a reminder for regular check-ups and health education  especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged segments who lack comprehensive health care provisions and knowledge.
Aortic Dissection,9,85,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-years smoking history. He is a retired professional  lives with his wife of 35 years  and has two grown-up children. His father passed away at the age of 70 due to a myocardial infarction and his mother has a history of hypertension. He presents to the emergency department complaining of severe  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back  which started suddenly about an hour ago.   Mr. Smith's vital signs on arrival were blood pressure 170/90 mmHg  pulse rate 105/min  respiratory rate 18/min  and SpO2 94% on room air. On physical examination  he appeared to be in severe pain and distress. His cardiovascular examination revealed uneven pulses between upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical examination was within normal limits.  Initial workup included an EKG  which showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. However  a D-dimer test was positive. A stat CT angiogram was ordered  which revealed a dissection of ascending aorta consistent with a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Mr. Smith and his family were informed about his precarious condition. After consultation with cardiology and cardio-thoracic surgery  an urgent surgical repair was planned. Mr. Smith was admitted to the cardio-thoracic surgical ICU while awaiting emergent surgery.  Mr. Smith has an established history of cardiovascular risk factors including a strong family history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a significant smoking history. Early and aggressive control of these risk factors could have potentially delayed or prevented this life-threatening aortic complication. However  given the current circumstances  early detection and immediate surgical intervention are essential to Mr. Smith's survival.  Following recovery  Mr. Smith would likely benefit from comprehensive cardiovascular rehabilitation and aggressive risk factor management including smoking cessation  strict blood pressure control and lipid-lowering therapy. A multidisciplinary team approach comprising of his primary care physician  cardiologist  dietician  and physiotherapist would be beneficial for his long-term management. 
Aortic Dissection,9,86,Patient Overview:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back. He is a heavy smoker with a 40 pack-year history and was diagnosed with hypertension twenty years ago. His mother died from an unspecified cardiovascular event at age 75.   Presenting Symptoms and Hospital Course:  The pain started abruptly while the patient was watching television  which prompted him to seek emergency care. He rated the pain as a 10 on a scale of 0-10. The patient reported that he has never experienced this kind of pain before. His medical history reveals long-term  poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He currently takes antihypertensives and statins irregularly.  Evaluation and Treatment:  In the emergency department  his blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg and his heart rate was 98 beats per minute. An ECG was performed showing nonspecific T-wave changes  which can be seen in aortic dissections but didn't give us a definite diagnosis. Due to his presenting symptoms and hypertension history  he was suspected to have an aortic dissection.   A CT angiogram was performed  confirming a Stanford type A aortic dissection  involving the ascending aorta. The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate and was emergently taken to the operating room for surgical repair of the dissected aorta.  Post-Surgery Follow-up:  The surgery was successful  and the patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful. He was further evaluated by a cardiovascular specialist who made additional recommendations for his treatment plan  including closer management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The importance of medication adherence was reinforced. Given his history of heavy smoking  a smoking cessation program was also recommended.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates that aortic dissections can be initially challenging to diagnose due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. In this case  the patient's age  sex  hypertension history  and smoking history increased suspicion for aortic dissection. Early recognition of the disease can drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the condition  and aggressive blood pressure management post-operatively is critically important for these patients. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive history taking  suspicion of diagnosis based on risk factors  and the need for efficient multidisciplinary medical and surgical management of aortic dissection patients.
Aortic Dissection,9,87,Patient Information:  The patient is a 66-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain. He has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  heavy smoking for 20 years  and was recently diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder affecting connective tissues. The patient lives in a rural region in Southern United States and is of lower socioeconomic status  hence has limited access to healthcare facilities. He works as a construction worker and hence is involved in physically strenuous activity regularly. He remains unmarried and does not have children. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including aortic aneurysms and dissections.   Chief Complaint:  The patient complained of severe chest pain  described as a tearing or ripping sensation  which started abruptly around an hour before. The pain radiated towards the back between the scapulae. He also endorsed instances of light-headedness and dyspnea.  Clinical Assessment:  Blood pressure revealed a difference between the arms (right arm BP: 158/94 mmHg  left arm BP: 142/86 mmHg). Physical examination showed mild diaphoresis and pallor. A systolic murmur was heard upon auscultation. Neurological examination was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Procedure and Result:  Due to high clinical suspicion of aortic dissection  a CT scan was immediately ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the level of the renal arteries. There were no signs of rupture or malperfusion. Laboratory tests revealed raised D-dimer and elevated troponin levels.  Management and Follow-up:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate. Vascular surgery consultation led to an emergency surgical repair - an open ascending aortic replacement with a synthetic graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post-operative recovery was uneventful  and he was discharged on a regimen of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. The importance of strict blood pressure control  smoking cessation  and regular follow-up was emphasized upon discharge.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection. It also highlights how certain risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension  heavy smoking  and genetic disorders like Marfan syndrome can significantly increase the likelihood of developing aortic dissection. Experts recommend routine screening for aortic disease in high-risk populations and those with a family history of aortic dissection or aneurysms.   Given the patient's sociodemographic status  comprehensive efforts must be made to ensure follow-up and adherence to the treatment plan  thereby reducing the risk of recurrence or complications.
Aortic Dissection,9,88,Case Presentation  Patient Demographics:  Our patient  Mr. G  is a 69-year-old African American male with demographic factors aligned with the literature on patients more prone to aortic dissection. He lives in an urban area and is retired from his construction job. He is widowed with two adult children. In terms of socio-economic status  he is in the lower-middle class  as is consistent with the higher prevalence of aortic dissection in this group.  Medical History:  Mr. G has a significant past medical history that includes hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. He also has hyperlipidemia and type II diabetes mellitus  both controlled under medication. He has a 55-pack-year smoking history  but he quit about a decade ago. He is neither a drug user nor a heavy alcohol consumer. There's no history of any major trauma.   Current Complaint:  Mr. G presented to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden  severe  tearing chest pain that radiated to his back. He described it as unlike any pain he had experienced before. The pain onset coincided with him carrying a heavy bag of groceries  upon which he felt a sharp  tearing sensation in his chest. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  diaphoresis  but no syncope  weakness  or paraplegia.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  he appeared anxious and in distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 180/92 mmHg in the right arm and 210/100 mmHg in the left. This variation in blood pressure measurement is suggestive of aortic dissection. The cardiovascular examination revealed a slight diastolic murmur. There were no signs of neurological deficit  and his pulses were symmetrical in all limbs.   Family History:  His father reportedly died of a 'heart issue' in his early sixties  but the full medical record was not available for detailed study. There is no known family history of Marfan syndrome or any genetic connective tissue disorder linked to the increased incidence of aortic dissection.   Procedure & Diagnosis:  An urgent chest CT scan was done for Mr. G  which revealed an aortic dissection  confirmed as a Stanford Type A dissection. He was rushed into emergency surgery.   Discussion:  The patient's demographic details and medical history  including being an older male  being African American  having chronic hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  increase his risk for aortic dissection. Smoking history  even though he quit  still contributes to long-term cardiovascular damage. His immediate complaint of sudden severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back is typical of aortic dissection. Accurate clinical suspicion  quick diagnosis  and immediate surgery possibly saved his life.
Aortic Dissection,9,89,"Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male named Mr. Smith. He has been diagnosed with a Type B aortic dissection. His body mass index (BMI) is 28  suggesting that he is overweight according to standard BMI categories. Prior to this diagnosis  Mr. Smith had a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was non-compliant with his medications and regularly smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years.  Demographics:  Data shows that aortic dissection is more common in males and incidence increases with age  with most cases occurring between the ages of 60-80. African American race  like Mr Smith  is also associated with increased risk of aortic dissection.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith's major risk factor for aortic dissection is his long-standing history of hypertension. He had also been managing diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years. Additionally  his smoking habit contributed to his overall cardiovascular risk. There is no known history of connective tissue disorder or trauma  other common risk factors for aortic dissection.  Family History:  There is no known family history of aortic dissection  Marfan syndrome  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  Turner syndrome  or any other genetic disorders associated with vascular disease.   Presentation:  Mr. Smith presented to the ER with severe chest pain described as a """"tearing"""" sensation radiating to his back. He was also experiencing cold and numbness in his lower extremities. On examination  there was a notable difference in blood pressure between his arms  and his pulse was 110 bpm.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  An emergent CT angiogram confirmed a diagnosis of Stanford Type B aortic dissection extending from the descending thoracic aorta just beyond the left subclavian artery to the iliac arteries  without involvement of the aortic arch.  Management:  The management of Mr. Smith’s case involved aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control to decrease the aortic wall stress. This was initiated with intravenous labetalol followed by nitroprusside in the ER. He was admitted to ICU under close monitoring. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted but initially conservative management was opted as there is no evidence of complications such as malperfusion  uncontrolled hypertension or rapid aortic growth.   In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of risk factor modification  particularly for hypertension  to prevent serious complications such as aortic dissection. Primary care physicians can play a crucial role in identifying and managing these risk factors and educating patients on the importance of medication compliance. "
Aortic Dissection,9,90,Patient Case Presentation  Introduction  This is a case study of a 67-year-old African-American male diagnosed with aortic dissection  a rare but serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears. This condition is more common in men aged 60 and above  especially African American men who make up a sizable percentage of those diagnosed per CDC data.  Patient History  Mr. Smith  as we will refer to the patient  is a retired postal worker who presented with sudden chest and back pain. He has a medical history of poorly controlled hypertension for over 25 years  and he is also a 30-year-packet-year smoker  although he quit 5 years ago. His father died of a heart attack at an early age  around 60  suggesting a family history of cardiovascular disease. He does not have any history of connective tissue disorders nor a history of recent or past chest trauma.  Evaluations  Upon physical examination  he appeared in significant discomfort. The initial blood tests  inclusive of complete blood count  renal function  electrolytes  coagulation profile  and cardiac enzymes were taken. An emergency computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was conducted confirm his condition following the suspicion raised by the sudden onset of his pain and his historical profile.  Diagnosis  The CTA revealed a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta proximally to the iliac arteries distally. Mr. Smith's elevated blood pressure was suggestive of his aortic dissection.  Treatment  Due to the location of dissection (Type A)  Mr. Smith underwent emergency surgery. A spinal drainage catheter was placed to monitor and reduce the risk of paraplegia. Beta-blockers were administered to control his blood pressure  in addition to this he was recommended to maintain a low sodium diet to manage his hypertension post-surgery.  Prognosis  Post-discharge  Mr. Smith remained stable and compliant with his antihypertensive medications. He was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and has been following up regularly with out-patient cardiology. He was highly recommended to maintain a healthy lifestyle  including a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  and regular check-ups to monitor his aortic health.  Conclusion  This case exemplifies the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment in cases of aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition that presents with sudden chest or upper back pain. For patients with aortic dissection  surgery or medical management depending on the type of dissection is foundational  but the importance of continued medical management  lifestyle changes  and regular follow-up cannot be underestimated.
Aortic Dissection,9,91,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American male  Mr. X  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain that radiates to his back and has lasted for approximately 2 hours. The pain is described as 'tearing' in nature. He states that this type of pain is unlike anything he has experienced before. His past medical history consists of hypertension  for which he has been poorly compliant with his prescribed medication due to forgetfulness and fear of side effects. He also has a history of smoking  consuming a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use.   Family history revealed that both his father and brother had experienced a heart attack at the ages of 58 and 60 respectively. His father also had a known history of high blood pressure.   On examination  his blood pressure is found to be higher in his right arm (200/120 mmHg) compared to his left (180/100 mmHg). He also displays a weak left radial pulse compared to the right. He is diaphoretic and appears to be in distress.  Lab tests reveal slightly elevated troponin (0.05 ng/mL  with the normal range being 0.00-0.03 ng/mL) and D-dimer (0.55 µg/mL  with the normal range being 0.00 - 0.50 µg/mL). His EKG shows nonspecific ST segment changes.   Due to his history  symptoms  and clinical presentation  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) is ordered  which confirms the suspicion of aortic dissection  illustrating a Stanford type A dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending to the iliac arteries.   This case is of importance as it displays the demographic disparities seen in aortic dissection patients. African Americans and men  particularly those around 60-70 years old  are often seen in literature as being at higher risk of aortic dissection. Hypertension is also especially prevalent in this demographic and a major risk factor  making this case fairly typical. The patient's disregard for his anti-hypertensive medication and his heavy smoking habit also contribute to his elevated risk of vascular events like aortic dissection. The presence of cardiovascular disease in his family further raises this risk.
Aortic Dissection,9,92,"Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. E  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male currently living in an urban area. He presents today due to sudden  severe chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature and which started a couple of hours ago. The intensity of pain was 8/10  radiating towards his upper back. He has accompanying symptoms of mild dizziness and nausea. He has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mr. E has a history of hypertension for the past ten years and is currently under medication  using Lisinopril 20mg daily and Metroprolol 50mg twice daily. He also has a history of smoking for about 30+ years which he quit five years ago. He has no other significant disease history.  Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70. He has two brothers  both of them are also hypertensive.  Social History:  He is a retired military officer  currently living with his wife. He has two grown children who are healthy. He quit smoking five years ago. His alcohol consumption is moderate  up to 2 times per week.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 185/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  and respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute. On physical examination  his left radial pulse is weaker than the right. Auscultation of the chest reveals normal lung sounds and a faint early diastolic murmur. There are no signs of heart failure (e.g.  peripheral edema  jugular venous distention) or neurologic deficits. The Stanford classification of aortic dissection was Type B (involving descending aorta only) according to the CT scans.  Impression:  The patient was diagnosed with aortic dissection based upon his presenting symptoms  history of hypertension  and CT findings. His case represents a typical presentation of an older  male patient with a known history of hypertension and smoking  which are among the highest risk factors for aortic dissection.  Plan:  The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation and management. A team of cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to discuss possible intervention. The patient was told to remain on absolute bed rest  with antihypertensive treatment titrated to achieve the lowest blood pressure that maintains adequate organ perfusion. He was also offered psychological comfort measures to counter fear and anxiety-related factors that could contribute to hypertension. "
Aortic Dissection,9,93,Patient Information: The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male  a retired lawyer residing in a suburban area of Idaho. The patient is married with two grown-up children who live separately.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for the last 10 years and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 6 years ago. He also has a 30 pack-year history of smoking  but quit 2 years back. In his early 50s  the patient was diagnosed with coronary artery disease  for which he underwent a coronary bypass graft surgery approximately 7 years ago.  Presenting Complaint: He presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest and upper back pain. He described it as 'tearing' and 'ripping.' Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  dizziness  and profuse sweating.  Family History: The patient's father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 72. His mother  87  is still alive with a history of hypertension and arthritis. His younger brother  aged 59  recently suffered from a stroke.  Physical Examination and Diagnostics: Upon examination  the patient appeared in distress with a noted blood pressure disparity between his arms. His left arm BP was 160/85 mmHg  while in the right arm  it was 130/80 mmHg. His heart sounds were normal  but a faint early diastolic murmur was detected. Initial ECG findings revealed a nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality.   Given the classic presentation and discrepancies in arm blood pressures  the suspicion for aortic dissection was high. A computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed  which revealed an extensive type A aortic dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending into the descending thoracic aorta.  Management and Outcome: The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for surgical repair of the aortic dissection. He underwent successful procedures including a Bentall procedure with aortic valve  root  and ascending replacement. Four weeks post-op  his recovery is uneventful  and he is enrolled in a hypertension control management program  with a plan for stringent control of his blood pressure and hyperlipidemia in the future.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and other vascular risk factors who present with sudden severe chest or back pain. The emphasis should be on early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention  which significantly improves survival rates.
Aortic Dissection,9,94,Patient Presentation:  Subject: A 63-year-old African American male named Mr. Davis.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Davis arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Past Medical History: He is diagnosed with hypertension but is inconsistent with medication and follow-up visits to his primary care physician. Yesterday  he experienced restlessness and discomfort that made him fail to sleep through the night. He has a significant history of tobacco use (one pack per day for the last 40 years) and is a social drinker but denies any illicit drug use. No known allergies are reported.   Family History: His father passed away from a myocardial infarction in his late 50s. Two of his paternal uncles were also diagnosed with heart-related conditions.  Social History: Mr. Davis is retired and lives with his wife and has two children  who are both in their late 30s.   Physical Examination: On arrival  Mr. Davis looked uncomfortable and was diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg on his right arm and 170/90 mmHg on his left arm. His radial pulse rate was regular at 110 per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiovascular examination revealed a significant pulse differential between the upper and lower limbs.  Investigations: Laboratory tests showed elevated troponin T levels; chest X-Rays showed an enlarged mediastinal shadow. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta. CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection  Stanford type A.  Management: Given the patient's critical condition  he was stabilized with medication to control his blood pressure and referred to cardiothoracic surgery for emergency surgical intervention.  Discussion: Mr. Davis's case typifies the connection of aortic dissection with uncontrolled hypertension. His medical history  race  gender  and age align with demographic patterns observed for this condition  with men being more predisposed than women  African Americans having higher risks  and the average age group being 60-70 years. Timely intervention is crucial due to the life-threatening nature of the condition. 
Aortic Dissection,9,95,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information:  The patient being discussed is a 63-year-old African-American male from a middle-class socioeconomic background. He is recently retired  once working as an automotive technician. The patient lives with his wife. He has three adult children  none of whom live with them. He doesn't smoke or drink  but is known to have a high-sodium diet.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of controlled hypertension for the past 15 years and has been taking antihypertensive drugs regularly. He was also previously diagnosed with high cholesterol. He doesn't have any history of any other significant disease in the past such as diabetes  kidney disease  or chest trauma. The patient suffers from obesity and a BMI of 31.5 falls into the category of Class 1 obesity.  Family History:  The patient has a family history of hypertension as his father had a stroke at the age of 70 and his mother underwent hypertensive emergencies during her later years.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient arrived at the Emergency Department complaining of acute onset of severe chest and upper back pain that started 2 hours ago. He described it as 'tearing' and 'radiating'. He also felt weak  short of breath  and nauseous but denied any loss of consciousness  speech or vision disturbances or palpitations.  Diagnosis:  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared pale and sweaty  with a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg and a heart rate of 105 BPM. Due to the clinical suspicion of an aortic dissection  a CT angiogram was immediately performed  which confirmed a Type A (ascending) aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the level of left subclavian artery.  Management:  The patient was subsequently started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower his heart rate and reduce the force of cardiac contraction  thereby easing the pressure on the aorta. The patient was also given intravenous nitroprusside to control his blood pressure. An emergent referral to Cardiothoracic Surgery was made for definitive surgical repair of the dissected aorta.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a serious condition where there is a tear in the aorta's inner layer  causing blood to surge through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers to separate (dissect). If the blood-filled channel ruptures through the outside aortic wall  aortic dissection is usually fatal.  Although it can affect anyone  it's more common in men and people aged over 60. Aortic dissection is relatively rare. The condition most frequently happens in the ascending aorta (Type A) and can extend into the aortic arch  descending aorta or even the abdomen.  Risk factors include uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension)  atherosclerosis  age  and certain genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome. Lifestyle factors like smoking  poor diet  obesity  high cholesterol can also contribute to the risk.  Survival and prognosis depend significantly on rapid diagnosis and appropriate management strategies. Early surgical correction is associated with better outcomes. However  despite all medical advances  aortic dissection remains a condition with high morbidity and mortality. 
Aortic Dissection,9,96,Patient Presentation:  Mr. X is a 60-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension and smoking  who presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating towards his back. His BMI calculated at 32  indicating obesity. He has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit 2 years prior to presentation. His hypertension has been moderately managed on Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. He denies alcohol use and doesn't have diabetes.   Family history reveals that his father had a stroke at the age of 65 and his mother died of myocardial infarction in her late 50s. He has a paternal uncle diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome. Mr. X’s first cousin died prematurely in his 40s due to aortic dissection. There is no family history of high cholesterol or familial hypercholesterolemia.  On examination  his blood pressure was significantly different in both arms. A murmur was heard during chest auscultation and his pulses in the right leg were feeble when compared to the pulses in the left.   Investigations:  A CT angiogram revealed a Type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending up to the level of renal arteries. Laboratory tests showed an elevation in D-dimer level. His complete blood count  renal functions  lipid profile  and liver functions were within normal limits.   Working Diagnosis:  Given the clinical and radiologic findings  a diagnosis of aortic dissection was confirmed. His hypertension  smoking history  obesity  and likely genetic predisposition (based on his first cousin's history) seem to have significantly contributed to this diagnosis.  Management:  Mr. X was immediately started on aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy with intravenous beta-blockers and vasodilators to control the blood pressure and heart rate  reducing the force exerted on the aortic wall. Emergency surgery is being planned for aortic repair  owing to the patient's unstable condition and the dissection involving the ascending aorta.  Prognosis:  His prognosis is difficult to predict given the emergency nature of his condition  but early intervention can decrease morbidity and mortality rates associated with this condition.  The take-home message is to consider aortic dissection in patients with risk factors such as hypertension  family history  smoking  and obesity  who present with acute chest or back pain. Aortic dissection is a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and aggressive management.
Aortic Dissection,9,97,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 59-year-old African American male  holding an administrative job at a local company. He is a non-smoker and drinks moderately. He has a BMI of 29  falling under the overweight category. His father and grandfather both died of heart-related issues in their 60s.  Presenting Complaint:  He presented to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. He described it as a tearing sensation  with a pain scale of 9/10.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension for the past 15 years  moderately managed with Lisinopril and Hydralazine. He had been non-compliant with his medication quite frequently in the last two months. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  which is currently being managed with Metformin and a strict diet regime.  Examination:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was alarmingly high at 220/130 mm Hg  and the rest of his vitals were unstable due to acute distress. His heart sounds had a normal rhythm  and no murmur was appreciated. His lungs were clear to auscultation. A noticeable difference of pulse rates in both upper limbs was observed.  Investigations:  Lab investigations showed an increase in leukocytes  and D-dimer was significantly elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show any acute ischemic changes. An urgent computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) showed a dissection of the ascending aorta  thus confirming an aortic dissection.  Diagnosis:  Given his medical history of hypertension  male gender  race  the sudden onset of a tearing chest pain radiating to the back  indicating a possible involvement of the aorta  high blood pressure on examination  different pulse rates in the upper limbs  and corroborated by the confirmatory evidence from the CTA  the diagnosis of an aortic dissection was made.  Management:  He was immediately managed in the ICU with aggressive blood pressure control using IV beta-blockers and sodium nitroprusside drip to keep his systolic blood pressure around 100 - 120 mm Hg. Further management entailed prompt surgical intervention  involving placement of a graft in the ascending aorta. His postoperative period was uneventful.  Social History:  On further discussion  we learned patient was under significant stress at work  leading to poor compliance to medication. Post-discharge education focused on adherence to medication  regular follow-ups  blood pressure self-monitoring  stress management  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  The case presentation has tried to incorporate pertinent information about the patient  reflecting the complexity of the patients typically seen in clinical practice. Because demographic representation points to a higher incidence rate in African-American males and in those with a family history of cardiovascular diseases  these elements were integrated into the patient profile. The case also emphasized the critical role of risk factors like uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  stress  and poor drug compliance in progressing to aortic discharges.
Aortic Dissection,9,98,"Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. Joseph Martinez Age: 58 years old  Race: Hispanic    Occupation: High School Physical Education Teacher  Residence: Albuquerque  New Mexico  USA   Chief Complaint: Sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has been a hypertensive patient for the last ten years  managed on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril). Despite recommendations for lifestyle changes  Mr. Martinez has struggled with chronic obesity (BMI 32) and has an extensive smoking history  about a pack-day for 20 years.   Family History:  There's a history of cardiovascular disease on Mr. Martinez's paternal side; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.   Presentation:  Mr. Martinez presented in the Emergency Department (ED)  complaining of sudden severe chest pain that he described as """"tearing"""" which started an hour prior to his coming to the ED. The pain radiated to his back.   On examination  he was diaphoretic  pale  and appeared distressed. His blood pressure was markedly asymmetrical: 180/95 mmHg in the right arm and 150/90 mmHg in the left arm.   Further diagnostic tests  including a computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  confirmed an ascending aortic dissection  requiring immediate surgical intervention.   The patient was started on intravenous esmolol to lower his blood pressure and heart rate  following which  he was rushed to operating theatre for an emergency surgical repair.  Patient's Course: Mr. Martinez underwent successfully a Bentall procedure. Postoperative recovery was complicated by wound infection requiring prolonged hospital stay  but his recovery trajectory was otherwise favourable at his recent follow-up visit.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with severe  sudden onset chest pain  particularly in those with risk factors like hypertension  smoking history  family history of cardiovascular disease and older age.   Aortic dissection mortality is high  but prompt recognition and surgical intervention can significantly alter the course of the disease  as illustrated in Mr. Martinez's case. As his high school's physical education teacher  Mr. Martinez's active role in his school community and his plans to advocate for healthier lifestyles in his students may serve as an opportunity for primary prevention interventions within this community."
Aortic Dissection,9,99,Patient Presentation  Patient X is a 67-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with aortic dissection. He is a retired mechanic who lives with his wife and has two grown daughters. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol socially.  Past Medical History:  Patient X has a history of hypertension  diagnosed around 10 years ago  for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril. There is mild control but the patient occasionally misses doses. In the past  he has been treated for elevated cholesterol levels  managed effectively with statins. He had been diagnosed and treated for peptic ulcer disease around 12 years ago. There are no previous surgical interventions in his medical history.  Present Illness:  He presented to the emergency department with a complaint of intermittent severe chest pain radiating to his back  episodes of shortness of breath  and occasional dizziness for the past 4-5 days.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at 72 years  and his mother had a stroke at 79 years. His older brother has been managing diabetes and hypertension  while his younger sister has an underactive thyroid.  Examination:  On examination  the patient showed varied blood pressure readings in both arms. A radiological investigation (CT) confirmed a diagnosis of aortic dissection. Laboratory findings showed mildly elevated cardiac troponins and he had an elevated D-dimer level. EKG highlighted nonspecific T wave abnormalities and left ventricular hypertrophy.   Summary:  Given the patient's age  long history of smoking  and untreated hypertension  he is in the high-risk group for aortic dissection. These factors  combined with his family's heart-related health history  justify this diagnosis. He is scheduled for emergency intervention and long-term management includes lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  regular medication for hypertension and regular follow-ups.  This case highlights that regular monitoring and effective control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients  especially with other risk factors  is of paramount importance to prevent severe conditions like aortic dissection.   NOTE: This case is a representative case typically found in the literature and does not disclose any information about a real patient. Always ensure to provide personalized care tailored to each patient’s individual circumstances.
Aortic Dissection,9,100,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: A 62-year-old African American male.  Presenting Complaint: Severe back pain  described as sharp and tearing  extending down the back  with associated shortness of breath and dizziness.  Past Medical History:  Hypertension diagnosed 12 years ago  poorly controlled. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol drinker  BMI within an acceptable range. No history of diabetes or hypercholesterolemia.  Family History: Mother died at age 72 due to myocardial infarction. A paternal uncle had an unknown cardiovascular disease.  Social History: Retired engineer  widower  lives alone  2 adult children living in another city.  Clinical Examination: On clinical examination  the patient was in distress due to pain. Vital signs showed blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 24/min. Examination showed unequal pulses in upper limbs. The cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Blood tests revealed a slight increase in D-dimer. CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  starting just after the origin of the left subclavian artery  and extending to the common iliac arteries.  Diagnosis: Type B Aortic dissection.  Plan/Therapeutics: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure. The patient was referred for urgent vascular surgical consultation for potential endovascular aortic repair.  In doing so with this hypothetical patient  it is important to understand his high risk for aortic dissection is primarily due to his history of poorly controlled hypertension and his family history of cardiac disease  both factors often documented in literature. The demographic background of the patient also raises interest  as studies indicate that aortic dissection has a higher incidence among males and African American individuals.  Please note:  This is a simulated case for educational purposes and should not be used as a medical reference.
Aortic Dissection,10,1,Case Report: Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year old Hispanic male  Past Medical History: Known case of Chronic Hypertension  Moderate Alcohol usage (20 years)  and History of Cigarette Smoking.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez presented in the ER with high-intensity chest pain that began sudden and peaked within minutes of its occurrence. The pain is described as tearing or ripping in character  radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. He also reported a feeling of faintness and severe anxiety. He denied experiencing any other associated symptoms such as sweating  nausea  vomiting  or palpitations remarkably.   It's important to consider that aortic dissection occurs more commonly in males aged 60-80 years and is also more common in the Black population  but with higher mortality in the white population. Risk factors highlighted in the case  such as hypertension  smoking and alcohol use  accurately represent the risk factors found in literature.  This case should provide a good cue for students about the possibility of an aortic dissection with acute onset tearing chest pain radiating to the back  especially in patients with a history of hypertension or other risk factors. They should learn the importance of immediate diagnostic steps  considering this as a surgical emergency. An inclusion of physical exam findings like differences in upper extremity pulse or blood pressure strengths  a new aortic insufficiency murmur  neurologic symptoms and so on into the case can demonstrate the high index of suspicion required for diagnosing aortic dissection. To further complicate the scenario  the clinical case could be developed to mimic myocardial infarction symptoms  reminding students of the fine differentiation required in real-life scenarios.
Aortic Dissection,10,2,"Patient Case:  Patient Information: Mr. Jerry Johnson  a 65-year-old African American retired military officer  presented to the emergency department in late evening. He lives with his wife in a suburban home and is a lifelong non-smoker with a moderate alcohol intake restricted to social events.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known diagnosis of hypertension which has been inconsistently managed over the past ten years. He has no known allergies. His family history includes a father who died suddenly in his 50s of a presumed heart attack and a brother with coronary artery disease.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson reported a sudden onset of severe chest pain  like a """"ripping"""" sensation  earlier in the evening  which radiated to his back and intensified over a span of hours. He reported shortness of breath and feeling lightheaded but denied sweating  nausea  or vomiting. He also mentioned a vague sensation of weakness in his legs.   Reason for demographics:  The majority of aortic dissection cases typically occur in men aged 60-80 years. It is slightly more common in African Americans than Caucasians. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. While Mr. Johnson does not smoke  which is also a risk factor  his hypertension and family history of sudden death and heart disease increases his likelihood of having an aortic dissection. Representing Mr. Johnson as a retired military officer may suggest a prior lower risk lifestyle  indicating the prominence of his poorly controlled hypertension as a major risk factor in his current condition."
Aortic Dissection,10,3,"Case Report:  Patient Profile: Mr. Thompson  a 62-year-old African-American male with a history of untreated hypertension and smoking  presented to the emergency department.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson had been diagnosed with hypertension five years ago but had been non-compliant with his medication due to financial issues. He also admitted to a 40-year history of smoking  although he has significantly reduced his tobacco use in the past decade. His family history revealed his father had died at the age of 58 from a stroke  also having had untreated hypertension.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Thompson arrived at the ER complaining of a sudden  severe chest pain that radiated to his back  describing it as """"tearing"""" in nature. The pain had started roughly an hour before his presentation. He also reported a sudden onset of sweating and feelings of anxiety. Upon further questioning  the patient admitted to vague symptoms of fatigue  malaise  and shortness of breath over the last several weeks  which he attributed to his work demand.  Note: Aortic dissection is more common in men  frequently in the sixth to seventh decade of life. There is a higher prevalence amongst African Americans and those with a history of hypertension. The demographic and medical history of this case should sensitize medical students to the significant risk factors and common clinical presentation of aortic dissection."
Aortic Dissection,10,4,CASE REPORT  Mr. John Davis is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department with sudden  severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mr. Davis is a retired carpenter with a history of uncontrolled hypertension despite being on regular antihypertensive medications. He also has a 30-years pack history of smoking and is known to consume alcohol occasionally. There is no known family history of aortic or other cardiovascular diseases.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He reports associated symptoms of slight breathlessness  mild sweatiness and a light-headed feeling  but denies any nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was lifting heavy furniture  describing it as the worst he's ever felt  unlike anything before.   DEMOGRAPHICS: Mr. Davis is a widower residing with his daughter and grandkids in the city for the last decade. He quit his job as a carpenter a year ago due to the declining stamina. His diet is predominantly home-cooked meals per his daughter  but uncontrolled despite medication  hypertension continues to be a problem.   SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient has a history of being a heavy smoker for the past 40 years  with a 30 pack-year history and drinks alcohol occasionally  with a weekly intake of about 6-7 drinks.  STATISTICS: Demographically  Mr. Davis's profile is similar to the majority of individuals diagnosed with aortic dissection  an occurrence more common in males than females with a ratio of 2 or 3:1. The average age at incident is 63 years old  with two peaks in those around the ages of 40 and 70  with the majority of patients being of Caucasian descent. Patients often have a history of smoking  hypertension  and high alcohol consumption.
Aortic Dissection,10,5,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  retired military veteran. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. The patient lives with his wife and is generally independently functioning.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on regular medication including Amlodipine (10 mg/day) for hypertension and Atorvastatin (20 mg/day) for hyperlipidemia. There is a recent history of moderate-levels of uncontrolled blood pressure. There is no known history of diabetes mellitus  ischemic heart disease  or rheumatic heart disease. His family history is significant for hypertension in his father.   Key Complaints:  The patient was brought to the emergency department with a complaint of severe  ripping  and sharp chest pain radiating towards the back  which started approximately 1 hour before his admission. He also reported trouble breathing and feeling lightheadedness. Before seeking medical attention  he had an episode of syncope. On arrival to the emergency room  his blood pressure was found to be disproportionately elevated (180/110 mmHg)  and he was conscious but seemed anxious and in distress.  By presenting this case featuring an elderly African American male  we align with reported literature that highlight increased prevalence of aortic dissections in males  individuals in their 60's  as well as those with hypertension  and more frequent among the black population.  Materials in this case report were fictitious and were used for educational purposes only. The descriptions for symptoms and characteristics of diseases were cited from """"Assessment and management of aortic dissection"""" published by the Liverpool Heart and Chest hospital in 2014."
Aortic Dissection,10,6,Patient Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  retired from a high-stress corporate position. He is a pack-a-day smoker with an approximate smoking history of 30 pack-years. He is a moderate drinker and leads a sedentary lifestyle. He lives in a suburban area with his wife. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father passing from a heart attack at age 65 and his brother diagnosed with aortic dissection at age 57.  Past Medical History: Patient has been diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension around a decade ago. However  patient admits to erratic compliance with his antihypertensive medication  frequently missing doses due to forgetting or dismissing its importance. He has no history of diabetes or endocrine diseases. The patient has high cholesterol levels  for which he has been prescribed statin therapy which he infrequently takes as well. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient presented into the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden  severe chest pain that started an hour ago. He described the pain as a tearing or ripping sensation in the center of his chest  which seemed to radiate to his back between the scapulae. Along with this  the patient also felt a sense of impending doom  shortness of breath  and a faint feeling. The pain did not alleviate with rest or any changes in position. He denied any gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms  any trauma or any recent strenuous activity.  This case study draws upon the fact that aortic dissection occurs in a significantly disproportionate number of middle-aged to older males  particularly with Caucasians being overrepresented. The risk factors  such as hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol  high-stress occupation  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  aligns with the common demographic and health profile associated with this condition.
Aortic Dissection,10,7,Patient Information:  Mr. William Smith  a 62-year-old African American male  retired engineer  who doesn't smoke and resides in Durham  North Carolina  reports to the emergency department on a Wednesday evening.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is known to suffer from uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years. He has been inconsistent in taking his hypertensive medications. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disorders. His father died due to aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 72. He does not have diabetes  dyslipidemia  or any known allergies. He denies alcohol or drug use.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Smith primarily complains of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. He also mentions that he has been feeling short of breath for the past few hours. On questioning  he reports having experienced intermittent chest pain over the last week which he dismissed as a result of exhaustion. He also admits to occasional instances of unexplained dizziness and nausea over the past few days.  Mr. Smith's case represents a prevalent demographic for aortic dissection. African Americans are reportedly at higher risk to suffer from aortic dissection  especially over the age of 60. Please note that it's crucial for students to always consider social determinants of health while discerning differential diagnoses and crafting a treatment plan. Mr. Smith's inconsistent adherence to his hypertensive medication regimen and his past medical history make him particularly susceptible to conditions like aortic dissection. Therefore  recordings of his reported symptoms and signs such as severe chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and dizziness should alert healthcare providers to consider conditions such as aortic dissection  angina pectoris  or myocardial infarction.
Aortic Dissection,10,8,Patient Information: Mr. Williams  a 67-year-old African American male who works as a school janitor. He has a past medical history of hypertension which is poorly controlled  as well as a 30-year history of smoking.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain that started suddenly about two hours ago. He describes the pain as sharp and tearing  radiating to his back.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. Williams was at work when he suddenly began experiencing intense chest pain. He said the pain was unlike anything he's ever felt before. The pain intensified progressively with the exertion of his duties and was not relieved by resting. The patient also reports experiencing mild shortness of breath but no dizziness  palpitations or fainting episodes. No symptoms of tingling  numbness  or paralysis were reported. He is not on any anticoagulants.  Past Medical History:  Hypertension  poorly controlled despite medication Longstanding smoker (30 pack-years) No known allergies  Family History: The patient's father died of a heart attack at the age of 73. His mother is alive and has hypertension. He has two brothers  one of whom has diabetes  and the other has heart disease.  Review of Systems: The patient denies any history of recent trauma  headaches  syncope  seizure  stroke  changes in vision  difficulty swallowing  change in bowel or bladder habits  unusual bleeding or bruising.   Current Medications: Hydrochlorothiazide  Amlodipine.  Social History: He has smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for the last 30 years. He drinks beer socially  no illicit drug use. Lives alone since his wife passed away two years ago.  Physical Examination:  Blood pressure: 175/110 mmHg  Pulse: 105/min  Respiratory Rate: 22/min  Temperature: 98.7°F.  Patient appears diaphoretic and anxious  his skin is pale and there are signs of cyanosis in his lips.  This concise case is meant to simulate a real-life scenario of an individual with demographic risk factors - African American male  advanced age  hypertension  smoking - presenting with an aortic dissection. The case is detailed enough to create a differential diagnosis and is followed-up with thought-provoking questions and discussions about the management of such a critical cardiovascular emergency. 
Aortic Dissection,10,9,Patient Case Report:  TITLE: Acute Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient   Patient Demographics: Name: “Patient X”    Age: 70 years Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired teacher Residency: Urban  East Coast USA   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension – Diagnosed 10 years ago. 2. Smoking – 40 pack-years. 3. Occasional alcohol consumption. 4. No known drug allergies.  Key Complaints: Patient X arrived at the emergency department accompanied by his daughter. He complains of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as 'ripping' in nature that started a few hours ago. The pain seems to radiate to his back  more toward the interscapular region. He also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath  mild profuse sweating  and a feeling of impending doom. He denies any abdominal pain  nausea  or vomiting. No recent physical exertion or emotional stress was reported prior to the episode. He states that his hypertension medication helps control his blood pressure  but he has been irregular with it over the past few months.  NOTE: As per the literature  acute aortic dissection incidence is more common in males and peaks in the 7th decade of life  thus a male patient in his 70s is chosen. Hypertension is the most significant risk factor and is present in as many as 75% of cases. Smoking is also a contributing factor. African Americans are also at a disproportionately higher risk for aortic dissections. The key complaints presented are typical of aortic dissection  providing students with a hands-on learning situation.
Aortic Dissection,10,10,Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Allen Hawthorne  a 68-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department (ED) at 8 am on the 20th of March. He is a retired lawyer  married with three adult children. Mr. Hawthorne is a non-smoker  with a moderate consumption of alcohol (i.e.  3-4 standard drinks per week). He leads a primarily sedentary lifestyle after his retirement  without any notable exercise routine.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Hawthorne was diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension around ten years ago  resistant to multiple treatment regimens. For the last three years  Mr. Hawthorne has been on a treatment regimen of a calcium channel blocker  an ACE-Inhibitor  and a thiazide diuretic  without much improvement in his blood pressure.   He reported a myocardial infarction (MI) eight years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty. Other than cardiac disease and hypertension  he has no known history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  stroke  or any other chronic illness.   Family history includes sudden cardiac death in his father at age 62  likely secondary to aortic dissection.  Key Complaint:  His chief complaint was an acute onset severe pain  which began at 7:30 am on the day of presentation. Mr. Hawthorne described the pain as a sudden and severe sharp tearing pain in the center of his chest  which radiated to his back. He also complained of accompanying shortness of breath and palpitations  but denied symptoms of nausea  vomiting  syncope  or diaphoresis.  Mingling medical professionalism and empathy  the medical team's primary objective is to deliver prompt diagnosis and management for this gentleman  bearing in mind that individuals aged over 60  African American  male  as well as those with a history of longstanding hypertension and cardiovascular disease are at increased risk for aortic dissection as noted in existing literature.  Subsequent sessions will review diagnostic tools  management principles  and preventative strategies in aortic dissection  using Mr. Hawthorne's case as a starting point for focused learning. 
Aortic Dissection,10,11,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection   Patient Demographics:   Mr. Williams  a 66-year-old African American male  presents himself to the emergency department. He is an ex-smoker with a 40-pack year history but quit ten years ago  drinks alcohol moderately  and is currently retired from a career in finance. He is from an urban setting and is married with grown-up children.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Williams was previously diagnosed with hypertension  controlled with medication for the past 20 years. He has no record of prior hospitalizations or surgeries  and there is no history of congenital heart disease. He has a BMI of 29  falling in the 'overweight' category. His cardiovascular risk factors include high cholesterol and a family history of heart diseases  with his father passing away from an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 70. Mr. Williams maintains a moderate activity level with brisk walking as his primary exercise.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Williams presents with an abrupt onset of severe chest pain that started approximately 4 hours before arriving at the emergency department. He describes the pain as sharp  """"tearing""""  and radiating to his back  also associated with a sensation of extreme anxiety. He self-administers his usual  as-needed nitroglycerin with no relief. He also mentions feelings of shortness of breath but denies any other associated symptoms like dizziness  nausea  vomiting  or sweating. When asked  he states he has never experienced anything like it in the past.  Clinical Presentation:  On examination  Mr. Williams has a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg on the right arm and 155/85 mmHg on the left arm  pulse rate is 102 beats/min  and respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min. On auscultation  no murmurs are heard. His pain score is 9/10. Other systemic examinations are unremarkable.   Based on his clinical presentation  demographic and risk factors  aortic dissection is suspected and further diagnostic procedures are indicated.   [N.B: Aortic dissection has a higher incidence in males  and even more so in the black population. Moreover  it typically presents in the sixth to seventh decade and is commonly associated with hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol  obesity  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Emotional stress can sometimes be a triggering factor  which is plausible in our patient's retirement life.]"
Aortic Dissection,10,12,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient's information: Name: John Doe Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Past Medical History: Patient has a 15-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 10-year history of type II diabetes mellitus. In addition  he reports to have a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 13 years ago. His father died of a stroke at the age of 72.  Key Complaints: The patient came into the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain that started at rest. The pain is described as sharp and tearing  radiating to his back. The patient also reports mild shortness of breath. He denies associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  dizziness  or loss of consciousness. Physical examination indicates a blood pressure discrepancy between arms and a weak femoral pulse.  Discussion: This case is designed to represent a typical case of a patient at risk for aortic dissection. According to literature  this condition is most likely to occur in men aged between 60 and 70 years. It is also more common in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking and family history  all of which are incorporated into this patient's past medical history. The key complaint of chest pain radiating to the back is characteristic of aortic dissection and should raise suspicions. The physical exam findings can further point to aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,10,13,Case Study: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. John Anderson Age: 69 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Army General Location: Colorado Springs  Colorado. Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a medical history of essential hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  which is under control with medication (thiazide diuretics) and lifestyle changes. He is also a former smoker of 30 years and stopped smoking around 20 years ago. He has mild atherosclerosis noted in his last cardiology review a year ago. He is non-diabetic  has no history of any heart disease or surgeries  and maintains a fairly active lifestyle for his age. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease with his father having had a stroke at 72.  Key Complaints: Mr. Anderson was enjoying a quiet mid-day meal when he experienced a severe  sharp  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The extreme discomfort caused him to sweat profusely and feel nauseated. The pain was sudden and did not subside on rest  unlike a chest pain typical of angina which he occasionally experienced during his morning walks. The severity of it prompted him to immediately reach out to his neighbor  who called for an ambulance. In the ambulance  the complaining of his symptoms did not relent. The paramedics noted an episode of syncope but were able to revive him with no cognitive impairment.  This case report presents a typical scenario of an aortic dissection for your medical students. The elements highlighted such as demographic information  medical history  and symptom presentation can act as potential indicators for considering aortic dissection as a diagnosis. Please note that aortic dissection is more common in males  and the average age at presentation is between 60 and 70 years of age. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  age  atherosclerosis  and a family history of cardiovascular disease.
Aortic Dissection,10,14,Patient Case:  Name: John Smith Age: 66 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Complaint: John came to the ER complaining of severe chest pain that started suddenly while watching television at home. The pain is described as sharp  ripping or tear-like  located in the center and upper part of his chest and radiating to his back. He also reports shortness of breath and excessive sweatiness.  Past Medical History: John's medical history includes hypertension  controlled with hydrochlorothiazide  which he has been taking for about 8 years. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history  but he quit smoking around 20 years ago. He reports a couple of episodes of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) but no confirmed stroke or myocardial infarction. No known drug allergies. Family history of aortic dissection in his late father.  Review of Systems: On cardiovascular review  Smith admitted to intermittent episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but denies any pedal edema or orthopnea. He has been experiencing fatigue and unintended weight loss over the past six months.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appears acutely distressed. His initial vitals show blood pressure of 200/110 mm Hg and pulse rate of 100 bpm. The pulses in his right arm are weaker compared to his left arm. No significant murmurs or pericardial rub are identified on auscultation. Lung fields are clear.  Based on the case above  students will continue with potential diagnosis  investigations  and treatment options for a patient who presents with findings suggestive of an aortic dissection.  Demographics in this case  such as age  gender  and a history of hypertension  align with epidemiological data suggesting that aortic dissection most commonly affects men aged 60-70  and hypertension is a known risk factor. John's smoking history further increases his risk  and his family history indicates a potential genetic predisposition.
Aortic Dissection,10,15,Case Study: Aortic Dissection   Patient Information: Mr. J  a 65-year-old African-American male with a BMI of 32.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years  smoking for 40-pack years  and a familial history of heart diseases. He was diagnosed with moderate arteriosclerosis three years ago. His current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.  Key Complaints: Mr. J arrived at the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain which began three hours ago. The pain was described as sharp  tearing  and radiating to his back. He also reported shortness of breath  mild confusion  and a feeling of anxiety.  Note: Aortic dissection is seen more in males than in females  with a ratio of approximately 2 to 3:1. Also  the average age at diagnosis is approximately 63 years. Hypertension is a major risk factor  present in two-thirds of patients. Smoking represents another risk  contributing to inflammation and oxidative stress in the aortic wall  producing degeneration of its structure. Familial predispositions are noted in nearly 20% of cases of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. African-American populations have higher risk for hypertensive heart disease and related complications like an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,16,Case Study: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. Albert Johnson Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Occupation: Retired civil engineer Residential Location: Urban residence   Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for 15 years  irregularly controlled. 2. Type II diabetes mellitus for 10 years  under control with oral hypoglycemic agents. 3. Previous smoker  having quit 5 years ago. 4. Myocardial infarction 3 years ago  managed with medical therapy and lifestyle modification. 5. Father died of a stroke in his late 60s.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson repeats his earlier call to his primary care physician  informing them about severe chest pain that started about an hour ago while he was having his morning coffee. The pain is tearing and radiates to his back between the shoulder blades. He describes the onset as sudden and states that the pain's intensity is unlike anything he has ever experienced before. He also mentions feeling sweaty and has vomited once since the pain began.   This case represents a typical scenario for aortic dissection  considering our patient's age group  ethnicity  and a history of hypertension—factors that are commonly associated with the condition according to medical literature. The specific nature of the pain  its abrupt onset  and the patient's underlying cardiovascular diseases should guide learners towards considering aortic dissection in their differential diagnoses.
Aortic Dissection,10,17,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. Johnson is a 63-year-old African-American male. He works as a construction worker and is a habitual smoker with around 40 pack-years history.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension about eight years ago but has been non-compliant with antihypertensive medications. He states he occasionally takes Metoprolol whenever he feels his 'pressure is high'. He has had no hospitalizations or surgeries in the past. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father died at 65 from a heart attack. His BMI is 29 indicating overweight and living in a food desert  his diet is noticeably unhealthy.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe chest pain that surged in intensity around an hour ago. He described the pain as 'tearing' and rated it 10/10. The pain seemed to radiate to the back  especially between the shoulder blades. He appeared diaphoretic and pale. In addition  he admitted to feeling weak and almost faint.  (Note: African Americans and males are statistically at a higher risk for aortic dissection  with a peak incidence in the 6th and 7th decades of life  hence the demographics for this case. Hypertension and smoking are major risk factors for aortic dissection.)
Aortic Dissection,10,18,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. X is a 65-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  residing in an urban environment. He is a smoker with a 40-pack-year history and has moderate alcohol consumption habits.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a medical history significant for hypertension (well-controlled on prescribed medication)  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of early Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in his father (died from a heart attack at the age of 53). He has no history of surgeries or allergies. The patient is on regular medication for hypertension (amlodipine) and hyperlipidemia (simvastatin).  Presenting Complaints: Mr. X presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset  severe chest pain of about 2 hours duration. He described the pain as 'tearing' that started at the center of his chest and radiated to his back. The pain was not associated with exertion and did not improve with rest. Accompanying symptoms were profuse sweating  shortness of breath  and a feeling of faintness.  This case effectively illustrates a high-risk individual predisposed to aortic dissection  considering the demographic probability  established risk factors like hypertension  smoking  and a family history of CVD. According to the literature  these elements raise the overall likelihood statistically and provide a useful teaching opportunity. The characteristic symptoms presented in this case should help medical students distinguish this medical emergency from other differential diagnoses such as myocardial infarction or musculoskeletal chest pain. This teaching case can be further used to discuss the importance of timely intervention and management of aortic dissection  thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.
Aortic Dissection,10,19,"Patient Case Report:  Patient Information and Demographics:   Name: Mr. J.E. Age: 63 years old Sex: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired University Professor  Past Medical History: -Hypertension for 15 years -High cholesterol for 10 years  -Former smoker quit 20 years ago -None known drug allergies  Key Complaint:  Mr. JE came into the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset  severe and tearing chest pain that radiated to his back. The pain started an hour ago while he was at home making breakfast. He has been experiencing occasional mild chest discomfort for the past week  but ignored it given his busy schedule. He also reported a feeling of breathlessness and was slightly dizzy since the pain started.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that disproportionately affects men more than women  especially of ages 60 to 70 years old. Hypertension is the number one risk factor associated with aortic dissection. African Americans have slightly higher rates of aortic dissection compared to other racial groups  which is attributed in part to higher rates of hypertension in this population. Symptoms often include sudden and severe chest or upper back pain  often described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping """" along with symptoms like breathlessness and dizziness with potential cardiovascular collapse. It's crucial to consider aortic dissection as an important differential diagnosis in these cases since the consequences of a missed diagnosis are devastating."
Aortic Dissection,10,20,Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  a current tobacco user with a 30-pack-year smoking history. He is a retired construction worker  living with his wife  and has three adult children.   Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 10 years and is on amlodipine 5mg daily. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and takes simvastatin 40mg daily. The patient also reports an incidental finding of a small abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.2 cm) on a CT scan five years ago that has been followed periodically with subsequent scans. Over the past five years  it has shown gradual enlargement. Additionally  his father died from a heart attack at 66 and his mother from a stroke at 70. He denies any diabetes  asthma  or any other known chronic disease.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez reports a sudden  severe  tearing chest pain that started about two hours ago while he was doing yard work. He describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced. The pain radiates to his back and also mentions a mild associated shortness of breath but denies any nausea or vomiting. He has no reported lightheadedness  palpitations  cough  or fever. Word of the abrupt onset and severity of his pain had scared him  prompting his visit to the emergency department.   Given the patient's history  age  race  and presenting symptoms  aortic dissection should be highly considered  as Hispanic populations and males aged 60-70 are among the most affected demographic groups.  Remember that while hypertension is a risk factor for aortic dissection  it often presents with normal or even low blood pressure due to decreased left ventricular preload from redirection of flow away from the left ventricle. This will be your medical challenge.  The exceedingly sudden onset of severe pain in a hypertensive patient is the clinical hallmark of acute aortic dissection. Therefore  it is vital to consider this in the differential diagnosis urgently to initiate prompt treatment and prevent potentially catastrophic outcomes.
Aortic Dissection,10,21,Case Report - Aortic Dissection:  Patient Information:  - Name: Mr. Jackson - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired military officer - Social History: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol drinker (moderate)  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for the past 10 years - Hyperlipidemia - History of smoking (quit 5 years ago) - Family history of cardiovascular diseases (Father died at 56 due to myocardial infarction) - No history of diabetes   Key Complaints:  Mr. Jackson came to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe anterior chest pain. He described it as the worst pain he had ever experienced  and it was radiating towards his back. The pain initiated one hour prior to hospitalization  while he was watching TV.   Mr. Jackson also reported mild shortness of breath but denied symptoms of nausea  vomiting  dizziness  or fainting. He had no symptoms of infective endocarditis  including fever  weight loss  or night sweats. No past history of surgeries were noted.  The above case representation aligns with the demographic profile for aortic dissection  which is more common among males  individuals of African American descent  and particularly those above the age of 60. Factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and family history of cardiovascular diseases are known predispositions for aortic dissection. The acute onset of severe chest pain with radiation towards back is a classic symptom of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,22,Patient Case:  Patient Information:   Mr. Thomas Lane is a 65-year-old African American male. He used to work in construction; he is now retired  and lives with his wife. He has two grown children and four grandchildren. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day  but he stopped drinking alcohol since his retirement  5 years ago.   Past Medical History: Mr. Lane was previously diagnosed with hypertension. Despite regular follow-up visits with his primary physician  control of his blood pressure was not entirely successful. He also has a 10-year history of tobacco use. He does not have a history of diabetes  heart diseases  or any surgeries. There is no family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Lane has come into the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden chest pain. He describes it as a tearing sensation  radiating to his back. He also has slight shortness of breath and feeling flush all over his body. He denies experiencing any nausea  vomiting  or palpitations. His Blood Pressure measurement in the right arm was notably higher than in the left arm.  This case is representative from a demographic perspective  as aortic dissection is more common in men than women  and the average age at the time of disease onset is 60-70 years. The patient's history of hypertension and tobacco use align with two of the primary risk factors for aortic dissection. This case scenario also reflects the typical nature and distribution of pain in aortic dissection  which is often described as a tearing or ripping sensation in the anterior chest or back. 
Aortic Dissection,10,23,"Case Title: Acute Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old African-American man currently living in South Dakota. He is a retired military officer living with his wife. He is a heavy smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history  and is known to have high blood pressure for the past ten years  which is managed by hypertensive medication. He also has a family history of heart disease.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson came to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden severe chest pain. He described it as a sharp  tearing sensation in his upper back  between his shoulder blades  which seemed to radiate to his chest. The pain appeared 2 hours before his ED visit  while he was carrying grocery bags.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  there was noted to be a blood pressure difference between his two arms. Auscultation revealed diastolic murmur. He looked visibly distressed due to the pain and had a slight shortness of breath.  Assessment: The sudden onset of severe  cutting chest pain and the difference in blood pressure readings in both arms suggest a possible aortic dissection.  Notes for the Discussion: The case revolves around an African-American male in the appropriate age range where aortic dissections are most common. The demographic representation  including geographical location  age  race  and risk factors  has been adhered to accurately as per medical literature. This case can be utilized to educate medical students about the clinical presentation  risk factors  examination findings  and early identification of acute aortic dissection.

Aortic Dissection,10,24,"Case Report: Acute Type A Aortic Dissection   Patient Demographics:  Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department (ED) of our teaching hospital. He is a retired navy officer  lives with his wife and has two adult children. His BMI was in the overweight range.  Past Medical History:  His medical history is significant for chronic hypertension managed with amlodipine and lisinopril for the past 15 years. He has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father passing away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Mr. Johnson has not had any surgical procedures in the past. Other than that  he has no known drug allergies.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson arrived at the ED complaining of experiencing sudden  severe chest pain for the past few hours. He described it as """"tearing"""" and radiating to the back. He also reported mild shortness of breath but denied any other symptoms such as sweating  nausea  or dizziness. He also mentioned he felt an abrupt onset of the pain while lifting some heavy boxes at home.  This case represents an instance of aortic dissection  an emergency condition which is seen more commonly among males  in the age group of 60-70 years. Hypertension is a major risk factor  as seen in this patient  along with smoking history. African American race has also been associated with increased incidence of hypertension as well as aortic disease. The classical presentation of severe 'tearing' chest pain radiating to back should be highlighted to the medical students.  Prepared by: Medical Educator   Date: 25th January 2022"
Aortic Dissection,10,25,"Case Report:  Name: Mr. John Thompson Age: 65 Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 15 years. He is also a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and has moderate chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy. His medication history includes metformin  lisinopril  and hydrochlorothiazide. He has a known allergy to penicillin leading to rash and itching.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Thompson arrived at the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain that started while he was lifting some heavy furniture an hour ago. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"radiating"""" from the chest to his back. The pain was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. He started to experience difficulty breathing  and he had profuse sweating. No associated symptoms of palpitation  nausea  vomiting  or syncope were reported. The patient denied any recent illnesses  trauma  or changes in medication.  This case report example of aortic dissection is in line with the demographic representation in literature (older age  uncontrolled hypertension  male gender  smoking  and African-American ethnicity). It also incorporates classic presentation features such as the sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to the back."
Aortic Dissection,10,26,Case Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Hypertensive  Smoking Older Adult Male  Patient Information:  Mr. AleX Thompson  a 67-year-old African-American male.  Primary Complaint: Presented to the emergency department (ED) experiencing severe and sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back  along with intermittent bouts of dizziness.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has lived with uncontrolled hypertension for the past 12 years and has consistently had poor medication compliance. He is a 30 pack-years smoker and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. He denies any history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or known connective tissue disorders.   According to the literature  hypertension is considered to be the major predisposing factor for aortic dissection (accounting for about 72% of cases). Aging  male gender  smoking  and a personal or family history of cardiovascular disease also increase risks. Black men  particularly in America  are disproportionately affected by hypertension and its complications.  Clinical findings on arrival: Mr. Thompson presented with high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg)  tachycardia (110 bpm)  and mild tachypnea. On physical examination  an apparent difference in pulses and blood pressure between arms was notable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the left sternal border.   The combination of his primary complaint  demographics  and clinical findings point towards a possible diagnosis of aortic dissection  but further diagnostic procedures are required to confirm this suspicion. This case  therefore  presents an opportunity to discuss differential diagnoses  diagnostic strategies  and management for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,27,Case Report: Aortic Dissection   Patient Demographics:  Mr. Albert Johnson  a 66-year-old African-American male  retired military personnel.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of persistent essential hypertension and a 25 pack-year history of cigarette smoking but quit 15 years ago. His father died at 68 due to a stroke  and his mother had hypertensive heart disease. His lipid profile done a year ago showed borderline high total cholesterol and LDL levels. He is not a diabetic  does not have any respiratory illness  or any history of previous surgeries or major illnesses. Currently  his medications include thiazide diuretics and a beta-blocker for hypertension.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Johnson presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of sudden-onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. He describes the pain as 'tearing' and 'radiating to the back'. He seemed anxious and worried due to the pain severity.   In this case  we introduce Mr. Johnson  an elderly African-American male with risk factors such as long-term hypertension  previous smoking  and dyslipidemia  representing a demographic that is indeed more prone to aortic dissection  according to the literature. Moreover  his presenting symptoms align with the classic presentation of aortic dissection  a condition that can often be overlooked due to its resemblance to other cardiovascular conditions.   Preceptors can utilize this case to teach students about aortic dissection's risk factors  clinical presentation  diagnostic procedures  and management approach.
Aortic Dissection,10,28,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Williams. He is an ex-smoker but quit 5 years ago and occasionally consumes alcohol. He is married and lives with his wife in a suburban environment.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Williams has a history of uncontrolled hypertension; his recent clinic appointment revealed a slightly elevated blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus which is fairly controlled (HbA1c 7.2%). He also had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago with complete neurological recovery. There is no known drug allergy and he is currently on an aspirin  a statin  an ACE inhibitor  and low dose metformin.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Williams presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an abrupt onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. He noted that the pain began while he was mowing his lawn  and it intensified over the next hour. The pain is not associated with shortness of breath  nausea  or diaphoresis. There were no symptoms of stroke or TIA. His current pain severity is about 8 on a scale of 0 to 10.  Note:  The majority of patients with aortic dissection are men  and the mean age at the time of presentation is approximately 63 years. Hypertension is the most common associated condition  present in up to 75% of cases. Aortic dissection occurs more frequently in whites  but the risk of rupture or death is higher in African Americans.  By constructing a case with a minority patient with classic but not stereotypical presentations  you can help students learn to consider a wider range of differential diagnoses and improve their understanding of who can be affected by the medical condition. 
Aortic Dissection,10,29,"Case Study: Aortic Dissection   Patient Profile:  Mr. Richard Thompson is a 68-year-old African American male retired Army veteran  who currently works part time as a security guard. Mr. Thompson lives alone after losing his wife of 30 years to cancer three years ago. He has two adult children and four grandchildren who live out of state but visit frequently.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a known history of hypertension  managed with Amlodipine  and high cholesterol for which he takes Atorvastatin. He has maintained these regimens for five years  with his blood pressure consistently within controlled limits. A smoker for 30 years  he quit the habit 12 years ago. His dietary habits are generally poor – usually skipping breakfast  and opting for fast food options for most meals. He also rarely exercises.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Thompson visits his primary care clinic complaining of severe  sudden-onset chest pain since this morning  which he describes as 'tearing' in nature  radiating to his back. The pain has remained severe with no relief from rest or nitroglycerine spray he had leftover from his late wife's angina treatment. He also notes a sudden shortness of breath and dizziness upon standing  which he attributed at first to stress from work and lack of sleep in the past few days.   The pain is unrelated to eating  deep breathing  movement  or any particular body position. A phone conversation with his son made him realize these symptoms should not be ignored and prompted him to finally visit his physician.  In this scenario  Mr Thompson's demographics align with known statistics  given that aortic dissections are more common in males between 60 to 80  and are more frequently seen in African Americans. The key symptoms of a sudden onset severe chest or upper back pain  often described as """"tearing or ripping"""" is characteristic of aortic dissection. Furthermore  uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for aortic dissection  making our patient's case a high probability one."
Aortic Dissection,10,30,Case Report: Aortic Dissection – Acute Presentation   Patient Demographics:  Mr. Flores  a Hispanic male aged 67 years  currently residing in San Diego  CA. He is a retired construction worker  married  with three adult children.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Flores has a 10-year history of uncontrolled hypertension. He also suffers from high cholesterol and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus three years ago  which is moderately managed with oral hypoglycemic medications. He has been a smoker for 35 years  although reduced in frequency in the past decade. There is no known drug allergy found in his medical records. He has a family history of coronary artery disease; his father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 71.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Flores reports to the emergency department with acute severe chest pain that began abruptly approximately 2 hours ago. He describes the pain as 'tearing' and says it started in his chest and radiates to his back. The pain is unlike anything he has previously experienced. He also complains of profuse sweating and admits feeling a sense of impending doom. He denies any associated shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  or leg pain. Upon examination  one can notice signs of anxiety and discomfort.  According to literature  the majority of aortic dissection patients are male and over 60 years old. Risk factors encompass hypertension  smoking  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of aortic disease. Symptoms typically include sudden  severe chest pain  often described as tearing or ripping  which can radiate to the back.
Aortic Dissection,10,31,Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African-American male  currently retired. He has been living in an assisted living facility for the last 2 years and is widowed with three adult children.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively. He also has a history of cigarette smoking for 40 years (one pack per day) but quit 10 years ago. Family history is notable for heart disease  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67. Mr. Johnson exercises irregularly  due to his hip osteoarthritis for which he takes occasional over-the-counter NSAIDs. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest pain that radiated to his back between his shoulder blades. The pain began while the patient was performing his regular morning bathroom routine  which includes light stretching exercises. The pain was described as originating in his chest and then moved to his back over a period of a couple of minutes. Accompanying symptoms included diaphoresis  shortness of breath  and nausea  but no palpitations  headache  or loss of consciousness. The patient reported that the severity of the pain was unlike any he had ever experienced.  The demographic  past medical history  and key complaints of Mr. Johnson align with typical risk factors and symptoms observed in aortic dissection patients  including age  male sex  hypertension  history of smoking  and African American race. The penetrating chest pain  migrating to the back  is the most common clinical symptom in aortic dissection as reported in several literature reviews.
Aortic Dissection,10,32,Case Study: Aortic Dissection  Patient Info Name: Mr. James Howard Gender: Male Age: 63 Race/Ethnicity: African American  Past Medical History: Mr. Howard is a retired manual laborer and has a medical background of chronic hypertension. He is a former smoker and quit approximately 15 years ago. He also drinks alcohol moderately. He has a history of occasional chest pains for which he uses over-the-counter antacids  attributing it to indigestion.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Howard visited the hospital Emergency Department complaining of sudden  high-intensity chest pain that radiated to his back. He described the pain as a sharp  tearing sensation. Accompanying these symptoms  he also reported experiencing shortness of breath  profuse sweating  dizziness  and faintness. He mentioned that the chest pain started following physical exertion  and it was unlike his usual indigestion pains.  Family History: No immediate family history of cardiac diseases. His father passed away due to lung cancer and his mother had diabetes mellitus.  Notes: - The patient's symptoms and history fit the demographic and risk factor profile of aortic dissection  with hypertension being a significant predisposing factor.  - Male sex  age above 60 years  and African-American ethnicity make the patient more susceptible to aortic dissections. - The nature of the pain (sharp  tearing)  its sudden onset  location (chest  back)  and accompanying symptoms align with the typical presentation of aortic dissection. - The symptom of chest pain following physical exertion could potentially mislead towards an angina or myocardial infarction diagnosis  re-emphasizing the importance of comprehensive differential diagnosis. - Given the seriousness and urgency of aortic dissection  immediate diagnostic action is required.  [This case is intended for educational purposes only  and should not be taken as medical advice. The patient demographics were selected in line with general trends in aortic dissection epidemiology.]
Aortic Dissection,10,33,"Patient Case Profile:  Name: Mr. Robert Alvarez Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired School Principal Residence: San Antonio  Texas  Presenting complaints:  Mr. Alvarez presents with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain that he described as """"tearing"""" in nature. The pain radiates to his back and feels worse when coughing. He also reports feelings of shortness of breath  mild syncope  and malaise.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Alvarez has a history of poorly controlled hypertension  diagnosed 12 years ago. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father dying of myocardial infarction at 72 years old. The patient is a former smoker  having quit 16 years ago  and drinks alcohol socially.   Rest Medical History: No Diabetes Mellitus  no hyperlipidaemia  and no known kidney diseases. He has not had any surgeries. His current medications include Lisinopril and Amlodipine for blood pressure control.  Allergies: None known. Family History: As mentioned above  cardiovascular diseases have been reported in his family  particularly on his father’s side. Social History: Mr. Alvarez has a history of tobacco use  but quit smoking 16 years ago. He admits to consuming alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug usage.  Upon physical examination  Mr. Alvarez appears anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was significantly different in the two arms. Both his lung and heart sounds are normal.  This case presentation is consistent with a patient who could potentially have an aortic dissection. Training based on this case should integrate comprehensive modules on symptom recognition  physical examination findings  diagnostic strategies  risk stratification  and management protocols for aortic dissection. It will help students to better appreciate the critical nature of the disease and equip them with a structured approach to avoid diagnostic delays for better clinical outcomes."
Aortic Dissection,10,34,CASE REPORT:  Patient Information: A 69-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  managed through medication for the past 15 years. He used to smoke one pack a day for 30 years but quit 10 years back. There is also a history of hyperlipidemia  and the patient is currently on statin medication. He has no known familial history of cardiovascular disease.  Chief Complaints: Presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset severe chest pain. The pain which is tearing in nature  started suddenly about an hour ago. It's located in the anterior chest region and radiates to the back. The pain didn't relieve with rest.  Notes:  This case was chosen because it includes the most common risk factors associated with aortic dissection: hypertension  male gender  advanced age  smoking history  and hyperlipidemia. While aortic dissection is relatively rare  it is more common in men than women and has a high mortality rate. African Americans have a higher rate of hypertension  which is the most significant risk factor for aortic dissection. The complaint and history are also typical for aortic dissection  with acute severe  tearing  or ripping type chest pain radiating to the back being a 'classic' presentation.   It's important to highlight that while this represents a stereotypical case  aortic dissection can also present atypically and has been reported in younger and otherwise healthy populations. Also  it crucial to stress the importance of a thorough physical exam  diagnostic imaging  and labs to confirm aortic dissection  as well as the gravity and urgency of the situation due to its high mortality rate.
Aortic Dissection,10,35,Patient Case:  Mr. Abraham Johnson  a 64-years-old African-American male presenting with sudden serious pains in his chest and back is brought to the emergency department. Abraham  a retired painter  is a resident of Montana  USA  and lives with his wife. They have three grown-up children with grandkids.   Past Medical History:  The patient has controlled hypertension for the past ten years. He has been using daily medication to control blood pressure  namely Lisinopril. He is also a chronic smoker with a history of nearly 45 years of tobacco usage. In addition to hypertension  he also has a history of high cholesterol and mild obesity. As highlighted in his medical records  he has been slightly non-compliant with the prescribed statin therapy for lipid management. Family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.  Key Complaints:  The patient describes the onset of pain as 'tearing' and 'sharp'  and the pain migrated from his chest to back. He rated it as a severity of 9 on a scale of 10. Accompanying symptoms include dizziness  excessive sweating  and transient loss of consciousness. He also mentioned that he has been feeling unwell with generalized weakness for the past few days. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the chest and back.  Note: Literature suggests men are more likely to experience aortic dissection than women  and it is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. Age and hypertension are also strong risk factors. Hence  the demographic details and medical history are reflective of these trends. Photosensitive epilepsy should also be considered among possible prognosis  as African Americans and elderly patients are high-risk groups. The presence of tobacco abuse further raises the risk of aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,36,Patient Case:   Demographics:  Mr. Idris  a 62-year-old African-American male  who is married with three grown children. He is a retired truck driver living with his wife in Raleigh  North Carolina. His city living conditions are accommodating  and he enjoys light gardening.  Past Medical History: Mr. Idris is known for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His condition has been somewhat controlled with medications: hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He also has a 40-pack year smoking history  although he quit after a mild heart attack ten years ago. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Idris was brought in by his wife to the ER complaining of sudden onset severe tearing chest pain that radiated to his back earlier this morning. The pain was so intense that it woke him from his sleep  and the pain was unrelieved with rest or nitroglycerin. He also reported shortness of breath and mild sweating. There were no other associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  or syncope.  Additional Context: Studies have shown that an increased proportion of African-American patients compared with white patients are diagnosed with aortic disease  including dissection  making race an important aspect of our demographic representation here. In addition  more than 75% of individuals who have aortic dissection are male  and the average age of individuals who experience aortic dissection is between 60 and 70 years. Risk factors such as smoking  hyperlipidaemia  and hypertension  as observed in our patient  are also linking factors leading to aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,37,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient: Mr. Samuel McKinley  Sex: Male Age: 63 years Race: African American Occupation: Retired fireman Marital Status: Married Location: Urban  Past medical history:   - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker - Current smoker (averaging 20 cigarettes/day) for past 40 years  - History of high cholesterol - Family history of cardiovascular diseases  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. McKinley reported to the emergency department with severe  tearing chest pain that started abruptly while engaging in moderate physical activity. He described it as the worst pain he has ever experienced  and it radiated to the back between his shoulder blades. He felt a sensation of a heavy weight on his chest. An episode of sweating and shortness of breath accompanied the chest pain. He denied any history of recent trauma.  Note: According to literature  aortic dissection is more common in males and in the 6th or 7th decade of life. Risk factors include poorly controlled hypertension  smoking  hypercholesterolemia  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Most aortic dissections occur in patients with a history of aortic aneurysm or existing atherosclerotic disease. The ethnic disparity with African Americans having higher rates is reflected in this case. Pain  described as a tearing or ripping sensation  usually abrupt at onset is a classic symptom of aortic dissection. The depiction of the patient's occupation and lifestyle contributes to his risk factor profile and could prompt learners to consider socio-economic factors in patient care and management.
Aortic Dissection,10,38,"Case Study: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Name: Jack Steward Age: 67 years old Race: African American Sex: Male Occupation: Retired chemical engineer  Past Medical History:  Mr. Steward has a known history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication (Losartan). He quit smoking around 20 years ago after a 30-year habit. Has a family history of atherosclerosis  with his late father having suffered from congestive heart failure. He also has mild obesity and hyperlipidemia. He has undergone regular checkups with primary care and adheres fairly consistently to his medication regimen.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Steward came into the emergency department with sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back  coupled with feelings of general weakness and dizziness. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and rated it as a 9 out of 10 severity. He also has a slight shortness of breath. He states that he hasn't experienced a similar episode of pain in the past.  On initial examination  blood pressure readings were found to be uneven between the left and right arm  raising the suspicion of aortic dissection. The EKG was normal  however  indicating a need for urgent diagnostic imaging to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection.   This case report highlights important signs and symptoms for aortic dissection that medical students must be aware of. It also presents the need to correctly interpret clinical signs such as uneven blood pressure amongst other dissection markers. The complexity of the case—characterized by the acute onset of symptoms and a significant background of risk factors like hypertension  age  race  and family history of atherosclerosis—makes it a fitting example for educating medical students effectively."
Aortic Dissection,10,39,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Carl Thompson  a 65-year-old African American male. He is retired from the US Army and lives in Texas with his wife. Former smoking history  quit 20 years ago. Drinks alcohol occasionally.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a medical history of hypertension  for which he has been receiving treatment for the last eight years. His blood pressure has been reasonably well-controlled with amlodipine 5 mg daily. He also has diagnosed hyperlipidemia and is on atorvastatin. He has not been diagnosed with diabetes  and his BMI is 28 indicating overweight. Family history is notable for a late elder brother who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson presented to the ER with sudden onset severe chest pain which he describes as """"tearing"""" that radiated to his back. The pain began approximately 2 hours before  while he was gardening at home. He looks distressed  his left hand was clutching his chest. He also reported shortness of breath  palpitations and mild lightheadedness. The patient denied any symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis.   Such clinical scenario is suspected to be an aortic dissection  given the patient's age  race  gender (male)  hypertension status  and description of pain. Hypertension is a known risk factor  and sudden severe chest pain is a classic symptom of aortic dissection. More males are affected than females  and incidence increases with age. African Americans are reported to have higher risks compared to Caucasians. Case studies like this will help medical students identify and manage patients with aortic dissection effectively."
Aortic Dissection,10,40,Patient Information:   Mr. Henry Davis  a 62-year-old African American male  retired plumber  who smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Davis has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He's on antihypertensive meds but is often non-compliant  attributing to poor blood pressure control.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Davis was brought to the emergency department by his worried wife due to sudden  severe pain in the chest and between the shoulder blades that started about two hours ago. The pain could be described as tearing or ripping. He's also feeling short of breath  unusually sweaty  and has a sudden onset severe headache.   Discussion:  The case presents with classical symptoms of Aortic Dissection  a relatively rare but catastrophic illness. It is most common in males and in individuals between 60-70 years. Risk factors include hypertension and smoking  both of which our case has. Symptoms generally include severe chest pain with a ripping or tearing sensation migrating to the back  shortness of breath  and sweating due to pain.  This case is useful to test students' ability to differentiate between common but less fatal conditions (like myocardial infarction) and rare but immediately life-threatening conditions. The diagnosis should be followed by emergent imaging via CT  MRI  or Transesophageal Echocardiogram for confirmation and to determine the type of dissection. Immediate treatment to control blood pressure and heart rate  and active monitoring in an intensive care setting is crucial. The course of treatment may involve endovascular surgery or open-heart surgery.   Emphasize to students the importance of communicating effectively with the patient  empathetic displaying  and maintaining calm during these critical moments. They must learn to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team  which could involve a cardiologist  cardiac surgeon  and radiologist. Communication with family members is also crucial  ensuring they are aware of the patient's condition  the prognosis  and the available interventions.
Aortic Dissection,10,41,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 64-year-old African American male who is a former smoker presented himself to the emergency department.  History:  The patient is known to have hypertension  which is a primary risk factor for aortic dissection. He has also suffered from coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to his smoking habit of 20 years. His medications include daily doses of aspirin  lisinopril  and amlodipine.   Presenting Complaints:  The patient reported a sudden  tearing chest pain that started at rest along with shortness of breath. The chest pain radiated to his back and upper abdomen. The patient also mentioned that the pain was intense and unlike any discomfort he had previously felt. There is no nausea  vomiting  sweating  or loss of consciousness. He does not report any weakness or parasthesia in limbs  no urinary incontinence  or vision changes.  This case stands as a reminder that although the occurrence of acute aortic dissection is higher in men and individuals over 60  it can affect anyone. It highlights the importance of a thorough and prompt evaluation  especially in patients with a history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease  when patients present with sharp and tearing chest or back pain. The case also indirectly underscores the importance of preventive health measures  such as blood pressure control  in patients at risk.
Aortic Dissection,10,42,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 63-year-old African-American male  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which has been inadequately controlled over the past ten years. He also has a history of past cigarette smoking  having stopped ten years ago. He reports no surgical history. Family history is notable for hypertension in his mother and an unspecified heart condition in his father.  Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the emergency room complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain. The pain began about an hour prior to presentation and radiates to the back. The pain is sharp  tearing in nature and the worst pain he has ever experienced. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  palpitations  and profuse sweating. He denies having any similar previous episodes.  This case focuses on the complaints and risk factors commonly associated with an aortic dissection. The age of the patient aligns with the typical age range for aortic dissections  usually occurring in individuals aged 50-70 years. The patient's race  African-American  is also represented in the literature with higher risks associated with aortic dissection. Hypertension and smoking are among the most well-established risk factors for aortic dissection. It should be noted that while his symptoms could suggest various diseases  the severe nature and specific description of the pain are highly indicative of an aortic dissection  a medical emergency often leading to sudden death if not promptly diagnosed and managed.
Aortic Dissection,10,43,"Patient Case:   Patient Information: Mr. Miguel Torres  a 65-year-old Hispanic male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Torres has a documented history of hypertension that has been managed with thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers for the last ten years. He also has a 20-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking around eight years ago. He does not have diabetes mellitus or any other significant medical condition. There's no family history of aortic dissections.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Torres presents to the Emergency Department (ED) describing a sudden onset """"tearing"""" chest pain radiating to his back that initiated around three hours ago. He also complained of shortness of breath. He denied fever  cough  GI symptoms  or any similar previous episodes.  Considering the demographic data and risk factors  aortic dissection is commonly seen in hypertensive males (60-70 years old)  and the majority of the patients describe the pain as sudden and """"ripping"""" or """"tearing"""" in character. His ethnicity also aligns with statistics that show the Hispanic population at elevated risk. Also  the patient's history of smoking is a significant risk factor even though he had quit smoking. Hence  this profile provides a suitable case for exploring aortic dissection.  Please remember  this case is designed for educational purposes and does not constitute medical advice or clinical guidance. It is important that the students consider a broad differential diagnosis and recognize how presentation may differ between patients."
Aortic Dissection,10,44,Patient Information:  Full Name: John Smith Age: 60 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Chief Complaint: Sudden severe chest pain that radiates to the back.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a 20-year history of hypertension. Despite medication  he has oftentimes a poorly controlled blood pressure  mainly due to non-compliance with medication. He is also a 40 pack-year smoker  meaning he has smoked one pack a day for 40 years. Previously  he was treated for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and has a history of high cholesterol. Although his father died from a heart attack at an early age  there's no other significant family history. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  Case Presentation:  Mr. Smith presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that started about 2 hours ago while he was gardening at home. He describes the pain as 'tearing' in character  10/10 in intensity  and radiating from the front of his chest to the back. He also reports he felt dizzy and short of breath immediately after the pain started. Apart from hypertension  he denies any previous similar episodes.  Discussion:  Given the patient's demographic profile (a Caucasian male aged over 60)  risk factors (hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol)  and the nature and location of the pain  aortic dissection is a major concern. This case could aid medical students in understanding key symptoms  risk factors  and the urgency for diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection. The course of the teaching session may include a simulated examination of the patient  interpretation of specific diagnostic tools such as chest X-ray  CT scan or MRI  and discussion on potential management and treatment strategies.
Aortic Dissection,10,45,"Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection  Demographics:  Mr. Joe Gomez is a 63-year-old African-American male  with a profession in construction work. He is a chronic smoker for 40 years  averaging about a pack of cigarettes a day.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Gomez has a 15-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and had been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications due to the lack of symptoms. He is also suffering from early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his long-standing smoking history. The patient also reported incidental findings of a thoracic aortic aneurysm in a previous health check-up but did not follow-up due to a lack of understanding of the severity.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Gomez presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back for the last three hours. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"worst pain of my life."""" He reported feeling sweaty and dizzy and stated the pain made him so uncomfortable that he needed to move around for relief. He also reported acute shortness of breath.   This case is designed to reflect higher incidence rates of aortic dissection among males over 60 with untreated hypertension  tobacco use  and a history of cardiac conditions - factors often seen in literature. African-Americans also have been found often late to be treated for cardiovascular diseases due to lack of access to healthcare  contributing further to the patient's presentation. A profession involving heavy lifting is included  given both occupational factors and socioeconomic status often influence this condition's prevalence."
Aortic Dissection,10,46,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. John Clarke  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  residing in an urban area. He is a retired military officer and currently works part-time as a security consultant.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain that started suddenly about an hour ago. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping """" rating it 10 out of 10 in severity. The pain radiates to his back between the shoulder blades and to his abdomen. He also reports shortness of breath  profuse sweating  dizziness  and feelings of anxiety.  Past Medical History: Mr. Clarke is a 20-year smoker with a 1-pack per day history. He has hypertension  diagnosed around five years ago  and he is on Lisinopril 20 mg daily for it. His blood pressure has been poorly controlled with systolic readings frequently above 160 mmHg. Known familial predisposition with his father dying at the age of 50 due to """"unknown heart condition """" for which he has never been tested but always been concerned. He also has a history of elevated cholesterol levels currently managed by Atorvastatin 10 mg. No known history of diabetes  blood thinner use  or illicit drug abuse.   Key Indicative Facts: The hallmark symptoms of excruciating chest pain radiating to the back  poorly managed hypertension  and history of smoking predispose the patient for aortic dissection.   Discussion: Aortic dissection occurs more frequently in males  particularly those aged 60-70 years old. It is associated with hypertension  smoking  dyslipidemia  and genetic conditions that affect the connective tissue. Being a hypertensive smoker with a family history of potential heart conditions  Mr. Clarke falls into the high-risk group for this condition. The nature and intensity of his chest pain  along with his systemic symptoms  push aortic dissection to the top differential diagnosis  which should be immediately evaluated in this high-risk patient. "
Aortic Dissection,10,47,Case Report: Aortic Dissection   Patient Information:   - Mr. Zhang  a 60-year-old Asian male presented to the emergency department. - Occupation: Retired Engineer. - Residence: Lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife.  Past Medical History:  - Has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years  poorly controlled  often non-compliant with the medication.  - 6 months back  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  - Smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history  tries to quit but relapses frequently. - No known drug allergies.   Key Complaints:  - Mr. Zhang complained of sudden  severe tearing chest pain radiating to his back that started approximately 4 hours before arriving at the hospital. - He reported no signs of relief with rest. - The ongoing pain was accompanied by dizziness and shortness of breath. - He took his home supply of nitroglycerin with no relief.   This case is representative of the typical demographic affected by aortic dissection  which is more common among hypertensive middle-aged to elderly males  and particularly higher rates have been reported in Asian populations. Smoking and uncontrolled hypertension are considered major risks. The hallmark symptom of a sudden onset severe chest or back pain  often described as tearing or ripping  is evident in this scenario.
Aortic Dissection,10,48,"Case Study:  Patient Information:   Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has been diagnosed with hypertension for over five years and is on an angiotensin II receptor blocker (Losartan). However  he admits to being non-compliant with medication in recent weeks. Furthermore  he has a 10-year history of frequent tobacco use but quit 3 years ago. He denies alcohol use. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 75. No history of connective tissue disorders in the family.   Chief Complaint:  Mr. Rodriguez was brought into the emergency department (ED) with sudden and severe chest pain that started an hour ago while he was at home. He described his pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  localized in the middle of his chest  radiating to his back  particularly between the shoulder blades. He also mentioned feeling nauseous but has not vomited. He denied shortness breath  cough  fever  or any recent trauma.  Note:  Aortic dissection typically occurs in males over 60 years old with hypertension (like Mr. Rodriguez). While it's common in all ethnicities  it is relatively more prevalent in whites and slightly less common in Hispanics. Tobacco use is a known risk factor  making Mr. Rodriguez's case fit right in the demographic profile of aortic dissection patients. The symptom of """"tearing"""" chest pain radiating to the back is classic for aortic dissection. As Mr. Rodriguez has many risk factors and symptoms for the disease  students will need to consider aortic dissection at the top of their differential diagnosis  with conditions like myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism also considered."
Aortic Dissection,10,49,Patient Information:  Mr. James Washington  a 67-year-old African American male.   Background:  Mr. Washington is a retired mailman  a widower living alone in urban Chicago. Mr. Washington is a father to two adult children who visit occasionally. He is active in his community church and enjoys gardening.   Past medical history:  Mr. Washington has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years. Additionally  he has a smoking history of about 30 pack-years but quit smoking 5 years ago.   Key Complaints:  He presented to the emergency department with an abrupt onset of severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back  which started a few hours ago while gardening. He also mentioned mild shortness of breath  but no other symptoms such as weakness  tingling  loss of consciousness  or fevers.  In line with demographic trends seen in medical literature  Mr. Washington's age  race  and history of hypertension place him at risk for aortic dissection. This case has been designed to highlight those risk factors  as well as the classic presentation of severe chest pain radiating to the back. These key points should be stressed when teaching medical students about potential presentations of this life-threatening condition. Students should also consider differential diagnoses in similar presentations such as myocardial infarction  pericarditis  and pulmonary embolism.
Aortic Dissection,10,50,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. John Brown  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  an accountant by profession  with past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  History of present illness: Mr. Brown experienced sudden onset  sharp  tearing chest pain radiating to his back after lifting heavy boxes at home. He also reports difficulty breathing. He describes the pain as unlike any he has previously experienced.  Past medical history: He has been managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years with amlodipine and simvastatin  respectively. He has a 25-pack year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago. He denies any history of substance abuse.  Surgical history: Underwent appendectomy at the age of 30.  Family history: Father died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and mother has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.   Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Review of systems: Denies fevers  nausea  vomiting  or sweating. He's not experiencing any neurological symptoms such as dizziness or fainting.  Social history: Lives with his wife and retired a few years ago. Enjoys gardening and occasional golf. Drinks socially  around 4-5 drinks per week. Stopped smoking 5 years ago.  This case is based on the fact that hypertensive  older Caucasian males are more susceptible to aortic dissections  as per medical literature. It's worth noting that the incidence of aortic dissection is also high amongst those who smoke or have a familial history of the condition. Aortic dissection should be suspected in older patients who present with acute onset severe chest or back pain.
Aortic Dissection,10,51,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol presented to the emergency department (ED). His weight is 75 kg and is a retired construction worker. He has lived with type II diabetes for 20 years.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed 15 years ago with hypertension and has been taking medication (Lisinopril) since. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol ten years ago and prescribed Statin therapy. A smoker for 45 years  Mr. Rodriguez quit ten years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol consumption. His father died of a myocardial infarction in his 50s.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez reported sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back  difficulty in breathing  and a sense of impending doom. He described the pain as 'tearing ' rating it a 10 on the pain scale. Accompanying these symptoms were syncope (passing out)  nausea  and excessive sweating.  On further probing  he elucidated that he was gardening when he suddenly felt an intense pain in his chest  unlike anything he had experienced before. The severity of the pain forced him to the ground. After 10-15 minutes  he was able to get up and call an ambulance. On arrival at ED  Mr. Rodriguez appeared to be in distress.  According to available data  elderly males  especially those with hypertension  diabetes  and a history of smoking  are at a higher risk for aortic dissection. The sudden onset  location  and quality of the pain described by the patient in this case are characteristic of aortic dissection. Mr. Rodriquez's presentation fits within the commonly observed patient profile for this diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,10,52,Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. Brown  a 65-year-old African American male  retired from his managerial job.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years but has a history of medication non-compliance. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years  and drinks alcohol occasionally. He lives a sedentary lifestyle and has a family history of cardiac disorders. He also reports having Type II Diabetes Mellitus for 5 years. No known drug allergies have been identified.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Brown came to the emergency room reporting abrupt onset of severe chest pain  which he described as 'tearing' and 'ripping'  starting from the front of his chest and radiating to his back. On further questioning  he reported that the pain started suddenly while he was watching TV and has been persistent for over an hour. Accompanying symptoms included breathlessness  mild syncope  and profuse sweating. He denied having any fever  chest trauma  cough  palpitations or lower limb swelling.  The demographic representation in this case  including race  age  sex  and risk factors such as hypertension  smoking  and a family history of cardiac diseases  is reflective of epidemiologically identifiable risk factors for aortic dissection as represented in the literature. African American men aged 60-70 with hypertension have a relatively higher incidence of this condition.  Learning Objectives: 1. Recognize the typical clinical presentation of aortic dissection. 2. Understand the importance of early detection and management of aortic dissection. 3. To appreciate the risk factors associated with aortic dissection  including lifestyle factors and non-compliance with anti-hypertensive medication.  4. Importance of immediate referral to a cardio-thoracic surgeon in suspected aortic dissection. 5. Consideration of a holistic management plan  which considers the psychosocial aspect of the patient's condition  particularly in relation to compliance with medication and smoking cessation support.  6. Highlighting the importance of early radiological investigations like CT angiogram in early diagnosis and management.
Aortic Dissection,10,53,Case Subject: 60-year-old African American male  Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year-old African American male. He lives in an urban area and works as a cab driver. He is college-educated and divorced with two kids. He has an average BMI of 25  is a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol socially.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history that includes moderate hypertension  which he manages with an ACE inhibitor. He also has a history of high cholesterol for which he takes statins. There is no record of diabetes and he has no known allergies.   Key Complaints: The patient presented at the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest and upper back pain. The pain was described as 'tearing' or 'ripping ' radiating to the back. He additionally reported feeling a general malaise and had elevated anxiety levels. The patient also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath and palpitations.  This case has been developed with the knowledge that Aortic Dissection has a heightened prevalence in males  particularly those of African American descent who are around 60 years old. The patient's reported clinical symptoms also directly align with common symptoms associated with aortic dissections. Moreover  the past medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol increases the risk of aortic dissection in this patient. Given these factors  this case allows medical students to understand the correlation between risk factors  symptoms  and high-risk populations for aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,54,Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Jones Age: 66-years-old Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired Police Officer  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Jones presents to the emergency room with sudden severe chest and back pain  which he describes as tearing and radiating down to the abdomen.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones is hypertensive  with a 15-year history. He maintains his blood pressure with a daily regimen of Lisinopril. He has a 20-year history of smoking  but quit 10 years ago. He occasionally manages his persistent stress and insomnia with Alprazolam. He also has a family history of cardiovascular pathologies  particularly his father who suffered an aortic aneurysm.  High-yield Case Notes:  Considering Mr. Jones' sudden onset of severe chest and back pain  his known history of hypertension  and his familial history of cardiovascular disease  there is a high degree of suspicion for aortic dissection. This condition tends to be more prevalent in males and in the black population  and hypertensive patients are at especially high risk. As his symptom of chest pain radiating to the back occurs in more than 90% of aortic dissection cases  his presentation warrants immediate clinical attention to rule out this diagnosis.  Further steps in his evaluation would involve advanced imaging techniques like CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiogram. Upon confirmation of diagnosis  prompt treatment strategies should be implemented  including strict blood pressure control and potentially surgical intervention.  The patient would stand as a significant learning case for trainees to recognize the symptomatology  understand the risk factors  and appreciate the urgency in diagnosing and managing aortic dissection. It also highlights the need for prophylactic cardiovascular care in hypertensive patients with a relevant family history. 
Aortic Dissection,10,55,"Patient Demographics:  Mr. Allen Jones is a 65-year-old African-American male  employed as a bus driver.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years  smokes about a pack of cigarettes daily  and has mild obesity (BMI of 30). His father had a fatal stroke in his early 70s. He is compliant with his antihypertensive medication and has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Jones was driving his bus when he started feeling an abrupt  severe pain in the chest which he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature and radiating to his back. He pulled over and his colleagues called an ambulance. He denied any loss of consciousness  nausea  vomiting  or any other symptoms.  NOTE: Here we cover a case of aortic dissection  which is more prevalent among males and African-Americans. Two definitive risk factors for aortic dissection are present: hypertension and smoking. Moreover  the patient's family history of cerebrovascular accident might indicate a polycystic kidney disease  which can also be associated with aortic dissection. The classic presenting symptom (""""tearing"""" chest pain radiating to the back) is included."
Aortic Dissection,10,56,Case Report  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 69-year-old African American male  employed as a construction engineer  residing in an urban setting. He is a former smoker  having ceased smoking 10 years ago  and drinks socially. He is married with three grown-up children.  Past Medical History: The patient has a notable medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels for the past ten years  which have been managed with medication and lifestyle changes. As a teenager  he suffered a minor traumatic chest injury during a football game that did not result in any long-term sequelae. His father suffered from an aortic aneurysm in his late 60s.   Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department late in the night with a severe  tearing pain in his chest extending to his back. The pain is reported to have occurred suddenly while he was asleep and waked him. The patient also mentions episodes of lightheadedness and transient loss of consciousness. He reports shortness of breath but denies any complaint of palpitations  nausea  or vomiting.   This case primarily points towards an aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The demographic data and medical history align with literature as African Americans and those with a history of hypertension are at a higher risk. The complaint of sudden severe chest pain  commonly described as tearing or ripping  moving to the back aligns with classic symptoms  as does faintness or dizziness. It's also worthwhile to consider the patient's history of high cholesterol and his father's aortic aneurysm in assessing the risks.
Aortic Dissection,10,57,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Leon Jackson  an African-American male aged 65 years  currently residing in the local urban area  comes in for a consultation. He is a retired schoolteacher and lives with his wife. His socioeconomic status is middle-class.   Past Medical History: Mr. Jackson is a known case of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  both diagnosed ten years ago and under medication. He also has a history of tobacco use  though he quit about two years ago. There is no known allergy or family history of cardiovascular disease.   Key Complaints: Mr. Jackson reports sudden onset severe central chest pain radiating to his back  which started around an hour ago while he was doing household chores. Associated symptoms include sweating and a mild disturbance in the vision. He denies any shortness of breath  palpitations  or loss of consciousness.   Note: This case scenario represents a typical representation of the demographic distribution of individuals with aortic dissection with prevalence being highest in the 65-70-year age group; males having a higher predilection than females; high prevalence in African-American ethnicity; and associations with risk factors like hypertension  smoking  and diabetes.
Aortic Dissection,10,58,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. John Hayes  Age: 65-years-old   Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Patient's Medical History: Smoking History: 40-pack years Alcohol History: Moderate drinker  Dietary History: Regular consumption of high-fat foods and processed meats Medical History: Hypertension for 20 years  managed with medication. Family History: Father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 73 years old.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Hayes presented in the emergency department with severe and sudden onset of chest pain. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back. He also reported shortness of breath and feeling faint.  Rationale: The choice of presenting a 65-year-old Caucasian male is representative of the typical demographic group impacted by aortic dissection. According to literature  aortic dissection is more common among males  aged 60-70 years  with risk factors such as hypertension and smoking history  which is portrayed in this case study. The chief complaint of sudden  severe chest pain that radiates to the back is characteristic of aortic dissection. This case will give an opportunity to students to learn about recognizing and managing this potentially fatal condition."
Aortic Dissection,10,59,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  who works as a construction worker.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past five years due to irregular medication intake. He also has a history of tobacco use  having smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years. No personal history of other cardiovascular diseases  chest injury or connective tissue diseases.  Key Complaints: The patient arrives at the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden severe sharp pain in the front of his chest  which radiates to his upper back. He rates the pain as a 10 on a scale of 1-10 and states that it started about two hours ago while lifting heavy objects at work. He also mentions feeling short of breath and experiencing a loss of consciousness for a brief moment.  Notes: This case presentation represents the higher prevalence of aortic dissection in males around the 6th and 7th decade of life  with risk factors higher in African Americans  hypertensive patients  smokers  and those with physically demanding jobs.   The chief complaints reflect the classic presentation of aortic dissection which is severe  tearing anterior chest pain radiating to the back  dyspnea  and sometimes syncope  demonstrating a classic Stanford Type A dissection clinical picture.
Aortic Dissection,10,60,Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection   Patient Demographics: Mr. James Carter is a 67-year-old African American male with a weight of approximately 230 pounds and a height of 5 feet 11 inches. He is a retired civil engineer who lives with his wife. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years and drinks socially. He has a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Mr. Carter has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled adequately with prescribed antihypertensive and statin therapy. There has been a significant history of cardiovascular diseases in his paternal lineage. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his older brother suffered from an aortic aneurysm at the age of 62. He is compliant with his medications which include lisinopril and atorvastatin.  Key Complaints: Mr. Carter presented to the emergency department with acute  severe  unrelenting chest and back pain for 4 hours. The pain is described as ‘tearing’ and ‘ripping’ in nature radiating to the neck and lower back. The pain started abruptly  has persisted  and grown in intensity over the hours. He was also feeling lightheaded  had profuse sweating  and shortness of breath with moderate activity. On further inquiry  he also admitted to feeling a weak pulse in his left arm compared to the right.  Please note: The scenario was created in the context of ensuring accurate demographic representation  as aortic dissection is often seen more frequently in males over 60  particularly those of African American descent  and those with a history of hypertension.  For instructional use  this case can then proceed to diagnostic  therapeutic  and prognostic discussions.
Aortic Dissection,10,61,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Ethan Thomas  a 65-year-old African-American male  a retired primary school teacher  living with his wife in an urban area  non-smoker with moderate alcohol use.  Past Medical History: Highly notable for uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years  known with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy. No prior history of any surgeries or major illnesses. Family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  with his father having suffered from a myocardial infarction at age 70.  Key Complaints: Ethan presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden-onset  severe chest pain  which he described as ‘tearing’ in nature  radiating to the back. It started while he was having dinner. He also described feeling nauseous  severe sweating and shortness of breath. On examination  there was a notable difference in blood pressure between the two arms.  This case presents a classic scenario of aortic dissection  a clinical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management. This case was designed considering the fact that the aortic dissection is more common among males  particularly of African-American ethnicity  around sixth to seventh decade of life [1  2]. Hypertension is the single most significant risk factor  which Ethan has been dealing with for a decade now [1  2].   References: 1.

Aortic Dissection,10,62,Patient Profile:   Mr. Rodriguez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male who works as a semi-retired contractor. He is a widower and lives with his daughter and two grandchildren. Mr. Rodriguez has a 40-year history of smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day but quit ten years ago. He is also diagnosed with hypertension and has been managing the condition with lifestyle modifications and medication  specifically Lisinopril  for 15 years.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that he described as sharp and tearing  radiating to the back. The pain was sudden in onset and was not relieved by rest. He also complained of shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and dizziness. His daughter reported noticing her father's skin appearing paler than usual.  Past Medical History:  Apart from hypertension  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia two years ago  for which he is taking Simvastatin. He also has a history of intermittent claudication. His father died of a myocardial infarction at 72  and his mother had a stroke at 80.   Social History:  Mr. Rodriguez is a former smoker who quit about ten years ago but still occasionally drinks alcohol. He admitted to having a relatively sedentary lifestyle  consuming a high-salt diet  and being under severe stress due to recent financial troubles. He denies any recreational drug use.   Discussion Point:  This case is a classic presentation of aortic dissection  wherein the key complaints of radiating chest pain align with the associated literature. Considering the patient’s age  male gender  race  and history of smoking and hypertension  he fits into the typical demographic profile for aortic dissection. It is worth noting that this condition has a higher incidence rate in males  aged 50-70  particularly in those with a history of hypertension or smoking. The ethnic component is also critical as aortic dissection is noted to have a considerable prevalence in the Hispanic population due to poorly controlled blood pressure.
Aortic Dissection,10,63,"Subject: Aortic Dissection - Case Study  Patient Information:  Mr. A  a 65-year-old African American male  retired  living in an urban environment.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension for the past 15 years with a documented high systolic pressure of 180 mmHg several times. Additionally  he has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his father dying of myocardial infarction at the age of 70. He has dyslipidemia  with high levels of LDL cholesterol  and has had intermittent complaints of chest discomfort over the past few years. However  he has not yet sought medical intervention for the same. He is overweight and has a sedentary lifestyle. He has not been taking his medications consistently due to financial reasons and neglect.  Key Complaints:  Mr. A presented to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back  described as """"tearing"""" in nature  and started about an hour ago. He also complained of shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and feelings of impending doom. He mentioned experiencing lightheadedness with a near syncope episode. No associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  palpitations  or fever were reported. He denied any recent trauma or heavy weightlifting.  Clinical Examination: On arrival  the patient seemed distressed  anxious and his skin was cold and clammy. Blood pressure reading was significantly different between the two arms with the right being 150/90 mmHg and the left 110/70 mmHg. Heart sounds were heard with a diastolic murmur noted. The remainder of the physical exam did not reveal significant findings.  Note: It is imperative to remember that aortic dissection usually occurs more commonly in men  the incidence increases with age  and is highest in individuals aged 65–75 years. Hypertension  smoking  dyslipidemia  and genetics play vital roles in the development of this condition. Several studies have also highlighted the increased risk in Black people."
Aortic Dissection,10,64,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male  retired from military service. His BMI is 28.2  classified as overweight.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 15-year history of hypertension  controlled with daily metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide. He has no history of diabetes or significant heart disease but has a 20-pack-year history of smoking. He’s been treated for high serum LDL (+190 mg/dl)  borderline high triglycerides (+150 mg/dl)  and moderate chronic renal disease (Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dl). The patient stopped alcohol consumption 5 years ago and reported occasional use of recreational drugs in the past.  Key Complaints: The patient was brought in by ambulance after experiencing an abrupt  severe chest pain after carrying groceries that radiated to his back and abdomen. In addition to this pain which he described as “tearing”  he reported shortness of breath  nausea  and profuse sweating. His lower extremity seemed relatively cold and pulseless comparing to upper extremity.  Case Background: Upon review of the medical literature  aortic dissections appear most commonly among male patients in their 60s and 70s  with a particular predisposition in the African-American population. Hypertension is frequently a significant risk factor. As per the National Institute of Health  people who are male and from an African-American background are at a greater risk.   The patient's history of hypertension  smoking  hyperlipidemia and his account of sudden severe  tearing chest and back pain along with differential pulses indicate an aortic dissection until proven otherwise.
Aortic Dissection,10,65,"Patient Case:   Mr. Jackson  a 65-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  presents to the emergency room with a chief complaint of sudden and severe chest pain. The pain is described as """"tearing"""" and """"raging"""" from the chest to his back. The pain began at rest two hours prior and has gradually grown worse. No other associated symptoms are reported except a mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jackson has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years. However  he acknowledges poor adherence to his antihypertensive medications  citing affordability issues. He also has a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking but quit five years ago. Furthermore  he denies any history of heart disease  diabetes  or other chronic illnesses.  Demographics: Mr. Jackson is retired but previously worked as an auto mechanic. He lives alone since his wife’s death two years ago. He’s a father to three grown children who live in other states but communicate regularly. He uses VA services for his medical care  adherently attending check-ups until recently due to escalating concerns about cost.  Note: The demographic details and past medical history align with the increased predisposition of older males  specifically in the African American population with long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  toward aortic dissection. The notable risk factors here include the age (>60 years)  gender (male)  hypertension  and history of smoking."
Aortic Dissection,10,66,Case Study: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Mr. William Byrd  a 68-year-old African American male.  Key Complaints: The patient arrived at the emergency room complaining of severe chest pain that started abruptly and radiated to the back. The chest pain was described as a ripping or tearing sensation. Mr. Byrd mentioned that the pain had reached a maximum intensity almost instantly after onset. He seemed very anxious and struggling to breathe  with mildly disoriented speech.  Past Medical History: Mr. Byrd has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years  non-compliance with antihypertensive medications  and a 20-year history of smoking. He had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) around two years ago but had not followed up for medical care since then. He also reports occasional alcohol consumption and denies any illicit drug usage.  Background: African American men are at a higher risk level for developing hypertension  and uncontrolled hypertension may increase the risk of aortic dissection. Other risk factors  including smoking  advancement in age  and male sex  align with the patient's demographics and history. The presence of a previous TIA highlights the potential of vascular disease.  Training Points: This case serves as a platform to discuss the cause and the management of aortic dissection  focusing especially on the consequences of uncontrolled hypertension. The abrupt onset of severe pain  patient's demographics (race  age  gender)  smoking history  previous TIA  and poorly managed hypertension alert us towards a potential aortic dissection  highlighting the importance of clinical history and vigilance in managing such high-risk patients.   The case can also be used to educate students on recognizing and managing hypertensive emergencies and the value of preventive care in vascular diseases. Additionally  it would be beneficial to touch on disparities in healthcare  especially considering the combination of racial and socioeconomic factors influencing this patient's access to health resources and adherence to medication.

Hypertension 2. High cholesterol 3. Previous smoker (quit 10 years ago) 4. History of sporadic recreational drug use (cocaine  in the distant past)  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain described as """"sharp"""" and """"tearing."""" The pain began approximately 2 hours prior to admission while he was mowing the lawn. Its intensity seems to fluctuate  but it does not completely subside.  He also mentions feeling a similar pain radiating to his back between his shoulder blades. The patient also describes recent episodes of weakness and feeling of faintness.    The patient’s wife observes that his skin looks slightly hollower and paler than usual  but denies any loss of consciousness  convulsions  or bowel/bladder incontinence.   The patient does not report any cough  fever  or other systemic symptoms. He also hasn’t noticed any changes in his vision or speech. He denies any modern medication  herbal remedies  or ongoing recreational drug use.  This case highlights the key presenting features observed in patients with aortic dissection. Including a patient with these specific demographics and past medical history also importantly allows for a discussion around risk factors such as hypertension  older age  smoking history and cocaine use."
Aortic Dissection,10,68,Case Report: Aortic Discombination   Patient Demographics:  Mr. Anderson is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who is a former smoker with a high stress corporate job which involves significant travel. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with both his father and grandfather dying of heart diseases. He lives in a suburban area and is generally uninterested in physical activities. His diet largely comprises of high fat  high cholesterol foods.  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a past medical history significant for hypertension which he has been managing with antihypertensive medication (losartan) for the past 10 years. His hypertension is poorly controlled  often spiking during high-stress events. He is also inflicted with hyperlipidemia and takes statins occasionally. The patient has been non-compliant in regard to medication and does not follow a regular exercise regimen. Mr. Anderson had a minor myocardial infarction 5 years ago  managed conservatively  and has no history of any other surgeries.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Anderson presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe interscapular pain which he describes as tearing and radiating anteriorly towards the chest. The pain started while he was in a stressful company meeting. He also reports shortness of breath  anxiety  and palpitations. His vitals showed an elevated blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. Upon arrival  he looked pale and was profusely sweating.  From recent literature  a majority of aortic dissection cases occur in men aged over 60 years with risk factors including hypertension  smoking  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. This case discusses a patient with the risk factors and classic presenting symptoms that should alert trainees to consider aortic dissection as a potential diagnosis. Care should be taken to instruct students on the urgency of this condition and the importance of a focused history and physical examination. 
Aortic Dissection,10,69,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 59 Race: African American Sex: Male Occupation: Truck Driver  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - managed with antihypertensive drugs - Lisinopril (since the last 10 years) 2. Marfan Syndrome - diagnosed during his late teens 3. History of smoking - approximately 2 packs a week for the past 30 years 4. Hyperlipidemia - managed with diet modification and statin therapy  Presenting Complaints: John Doe presents to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden  excruciating tearing pain in the center of his chest  radiating to his back. He describes the pain as sharp and stabbing  the worst he ever experienced. He mentions an additional unusual pain between his shoulder blades. The pain started while he was lifting heavy objects at work approximately 3 hours ago.   The patient reports feeling dizzy and had an episode of syncope just before arriving at the ED. He also mentions experiencing shortness of breath but no other respiratory symptoms like coughing or wheezing. There is no nausea or vomiting but he does feel a little sweaty and anxious.  He denies similar past episodes  no prior history of heart problems apart from hypertension. He travels long distances in his truck but denies recent long-period immobility. His father died suddenly at the age of 62  the cause of which was never determined.  Note: African American men aged 50-70 with a history of smoking  hypertension  and Marfan Syndrome form a demographic group at an increased risk of aortic dissections. This case presentation aims at teaching medical students to recognize the typical symptoms and risk factors to reach a prompt diagnosis and select appropriate medical interventions.
Aortic Dissection,10,70,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents at the emergency department.  Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been managed with medication for the past ten years. He's also a smoker with a 25-pack-year history  and he drinks alcohol socially. He had also been diagnosed and treated for hypercholesterolemia for five years. There's no family history of cardiovascular disease.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Johnson reports a sudden onset of sharp and severe chest pain that began at rest. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and says it radiates to his back  between the shoulder blades. The pain intensity has remained constant since onset and is not alleviated by positional changes. He also reports associated symptoms of light-headedness  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating.  NOTE to Educator: This case reflects the demographic trends noted in literature related to aortic dissection. According to the literature  aortic dissection is more common in males aged 60 to 80 years. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for aortic dissection  being present in up to 75% of cases. It tends to affect people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds differently  with the highest incidence rates reported in African-Americans. Other risk factors include smoking and hypercholesterolemia."
Aortic Dissection,10,71,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:   Mr. J. Martinez is a 66-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 40-year pack smoking history. He is retired from a job as a factory worker and has limited physical activity due to accompanying osteoarthritis.   Chief Complaint:  Mr. Martinez presents to the ER complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain that started an hour ago. He described the pain as 'tearing' and 'radiating' from his chest to his back.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Martinez has been treated for hypertension for over 10 years and for high cholesterol for approximately 5 years. His hypertension has been poorly controlled  with recent office readings consistently >140/90 mmHg. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years  averaging one pack per day  with several failed attempts at cessation. His father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. He has osteoarthritis  which has been managed by over the counter NSAIDs.  Medication History:  His current medications include Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily for hypercholesterolemia.  Social History:  He lives with his wife and has two adult children living nearby. He regularly consumes alcohol  averaging at two standard drinks per day.  Overview:  Patients like Mr. Martinez represent a key demographic at risk for aortic dissection  with male sex  advanced age  and uncontrolled hypertension serving as noteworthy risk factors. Upon the presentation of sudden severe chest pain  especially one described as 'tearing' and 'radiating ' aortic dissection should be highly suspected. This case allows medical students to grasp the importance of recognizing such symptoms promptly  stratifying patient risk  and initiating appropriate and timely measures.
Aortic Dissection,10,72,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics: The patient is Mr. Harold Smith  a Caucasian man  65 years old  retired high school teacher. He lives in suburban America  Massachusetts with his wife. Mr. Smith is a moderate smoker for the past 40 years  with a moderately unhealthy diet high in saturated fats and low in fiber. He has a BMI of 29  bordering on obesity. He doesn't exercise regularly. Immutable risk factors include him being male and his age  both of which correlate with a higher prevalence of aortic dissection.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension for 15 years which has been moderately controlled on antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors). He has been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  which is moderately controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents. Also  a year ago  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and placed on statins. He has no history of surgeries or major illnesses apart from above. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother had a stroke in her late sixties.  Key Complaint: Mr. Smith arrived in the emergency room complaining of sudden unbearable sharp chest pain that started an hour ago while he was watching television. The pain started in the middle of his chest and radiated to his back  described as """"tearing"""" in character. He also reported mild shortness of breath  excessive sweating  and discomfort associated with nausea. He denied any symptoms of fever  cough  or sudden weight loss. The pain didn’t improve with rest or nitroglycerine that he had at home for angina episodes. He looked extremely anxious and was in obvious distress.  All these symptoms point towards a suspicion of aortic dissection; prompt diagnosis and management is crucial due to the disease's life-threatening nature. The aim of this case study is to further delve into the diagnostic and management pathway while managing such critical patients.  [Note for medical educators: Although these demographics and predisposing factors are typical of many aortic dissection cases  it’s important to stress to the students that the disease can occur outside this demographic too  and they should always suspect it when presented with the classic """"tearing"""" type of chest pain and associated symptoms.]"
Aortic Dissection,10,73,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  divorced  and a retired mechanic. He is a lifelong resident of the Northeastern United States and reports a previous smoking history of 20 pack-years  having quit about 10 years ago. He also has a history of alcohol use but really decreased his intake after retirement.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Additionally  there is a family history of atherosclerosis and stroke in his mother.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the Emergency department complaining of a severe  sharp pain in the lower back and abdomen. The pain started abruptly two hours ago and has been progressively worsening. The severity of the pain he describes is unlike anything he has experienced before. He also reported feeling clammy  slight nausea  and dizziness. The patient denied any recent trauma or injury and no recent strenuous activity.  Upon physical examination  the patient was observed to be hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg  pulse of 100/min  respirations of 20/min  and saturation of 92% on room air. On auscultation  there was a discrepancy in blood pressure between the right and left arms  a significant sign of aortic dissection.  This case provides an example of patients most commonly affected by aortic dissection  namely males older than 60 with a history of hypertension  as the literature indicates. Combining the classic symptoms of unexplained severe back/abdominal pain  history of smoking  and vascular diseases would allow medical students to hone in on crucial clinical components of diagnosis and management.   The case will further lead to detailed explanation and understanding of aortic dissection's clinical presentation  risk factors  diagnostic techniques  and treatment options  emphasizing the high degree of suspicion required for early diagnosis and treatment.
Aortic Dissection,10,74,Case Report: Aortic Dissection   a. Patient Information  Patient: Mr. Eugene Smith Age: 65 years Race: African American Gender: Male Occupation: Retired engineer  b.

Social History  He is unmarried and lives with his younger sister. His daily activities involve light housework and gardening. He doesn't drink alcohol.   e. History of Present Illness  The patient was asymptomatic until one hour before presentation. He was doing some light gardening when he suddenly started to feel severe chest pain. The pain worsened over time  leading to a fainting episode.  Note: Aortic dissection has a male predominance  and is often seen in patients aged 60-70 years. Risk factors include hypertension (primary risk factor)  smoking  hyperlipidemia  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and African American ethnicity. This case was created maintaining these demographics and risk factors in mind for better representation.
Aortic Dissection,10,75,"Case Report: Acute Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Mr. Jones  a 70-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and heavy smoking  presents to the emergency department.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a history of essential hypertension  which has not been adequately managed due to medication non-compliance. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years. In addition  he has brief history of high cholesterol  although he refuses to take prescribed statins. He denies any significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His only medication currently is Lisinopril  which he admits to rarely taking.  Key Complaints: The patient reports a sudden severe pain in his chest and upper back  which he describes as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping""""  that started approximately 2 hours ago. The intensity of the pain escalated quickly and led him to seek immediate medical attention. He also complains of mild shortness of breath  but denies nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. He denies experiencing prior episodes of similar pain.  Clinical findings and other relevant information will be explored further in the teaching session.  Clinical context: Acute aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening emergency that requires swift recognition and appropriate management. The patient is a representative example of demographic and risk factors that have been linked to aortic dissection: older age  male gender  African American race  uncontrolled hypertension  and tobacco use. This case aims to contrast the traditional chest pain presentations  highlight the importance of a thorough medical history  and stress urgent management of this condition."
Aortic Dissection,10,76,Patient Profile:  Name: David Miller Age: 67 years Sex: Gender Occupation: Retired military officer  Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Rural Midwest  Past Medical History:   Mr. Miller has a history of hypertension for the past 15 years which is currently managed by medication. He has also been smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a stroke at the age of 72. His lipid profile shows moderate hyperlipidemia. Mr. Miller drinks alcohol occasionally and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to arthritis.   Key complaints:  Mr. Miller presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden  severe chest pain that started an hour ago. The pain is described as tearing  radiating to the back  and not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. He also reported shortness of breath  abnormal pulse  and a feeling of impending doom. He showed signs of sweating  pallor  and was visibly distressed.   Note:  Aortic dissection is often seen in elderly men with risk factors including uncontrolled hypertension  atherosclerosis  and tobacco use. This case is representative as it portrays a typical patient demographic  along with a typical presentation of severe chest pain and other features that would make aortic dissection a high probability in the differential diagnosis.
Aortic Dissection,10,77,"Patient Case:  Mr. Thomas  a 62-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with severe  abrupt onset chest pain. He described the pain as “tearing” that radiated from the front of the chest to the back. The pain started about two hours ago and has become progressively worse.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thomas is a long-term smoker with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol  cardiovascular disease  with no known diabetes. He is currently taking antihypertensive medicine Amlodipine and cholesterol-lowering medication  but he admits that he doesn't take it consistently due to irregular follow-up with his primary care provider. Per his reports  he started feeling unwell last night with general malaise but dismissed it as fatigue.   Evaluation of Literature-based Demographic Representation: According to medical literature  males are more prone to developing aortic dissection  with a peak incidence at 60-80 years old. People with hypertension  particularly uncontrolled as in Mr. Thomas's case  are at an increased risk. African Americans are also believed to have higher predisposition due to increased prevalence of hypertension. Smoking can also increase the risk due to yielding changes in the aortic wall. Thus  Mr. Thomas's demographic and medical history align with the typical risk factors associated with aortic dissection.   Key Complaints: The primary complaint in cases of aortic dissection is typically acute onset severe chest pain  often described as a """"ripping"""" or """"tearing"""" sensation that radiates to the back. This pain is typically sudden  sharp  and may vary in intensity. Mr. Thomas's description of his pain fits this classic presentation.   In this training case  students should be able to recognize the symptoms of aortic dissection and the importance of thorough history taking  particularly focusing on cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. It will also provide lessons on the urgency and critical nature of aortic dissection and the importance of time-specific interventions. "
Aortic Dissection,10,78,Case Report  Patient Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old African American male from a lower-middle-class neighborhood. He is a retired mechanic  who smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for over 30 years. He admits regular alcohol consumption but denies any illicit drug use.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years  for which he has been prescribed multiple medications. His blood pressure often remains above 140/90 mm Hg. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Commendably  he has been compliant with his therapy but admits he does not participate in regular physical exercise. His father passed away due to a stroke while his mother has a history of coronary artery disease. He also admits avoiding regular follow-ups for monitoring his hypertension due to financial constraints.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson arrived in the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain that started while he was doing household chores. He described it as a sharp  tearing pain radiating to the back and associated with shortness of breath. The pain was not relieved by nitroglycerin that he uses for regularly occurring chest discomfort. He also noted feeling light-headed and having a vague  undefined sense of anxiety. No similar incidents were reported in the past.  Demographic Justification: Aortic dissection is more common in males and the incidence increases with age  with peak onset in the sixth to eighth decades of life. This condition is also more prevalent among African American individuals and those with a history of hypertension. Smoking  age  race  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of vascular diseases play a significant role in the risk posed to the patient. It's also important to note that low socioeconomic status influences both the incidence and control of hypertension. 
Aortic Dissection,10,79,Patient Information: Mr. Clarence McDaniel  a 66-year-old African American retired factory worker  residing in an urban area.  Past Medical History: Mr. McDaniel has a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  Stage 2 (moderate) chronic kidney disease  and he is a 30-pack-year tobacco smoker. He has been prescribed Lisinopril and Amlodipine for hypertension but is non-compliant with taking medications regularly. He doesn't exercise regularly and his diet consists mainly of high salt and high fat foods.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. McDaniel presented in the emergency department with acute sudden onset severe chest pain described as 'tearing' in nature that radiated to his upper back. The pain started while he was lifting a heavy bag of groceries. He reports the pain as being different from any he has experienced before  rating it 10/10 in intensity. He also mentioned a feeling of persistent coldness in his left leg and an unexplained weight loss over the past month.   Note: This case study represents a population (males  African Americans  and age group of 60-70 years) which  as per literature  is more prone to develop aortic dissection. The presence of uncontrolled hypertension  chronic kidney disease  tobacco smoking history  and weight lifting (increase in hemodynamic stress) further enforces the risk factors associated with this condition. The clinical complaints are also designed to be characteristic for aortic dissection - severe tearing pain  radiation to the back  as well as systemic and peripheral signs such as weight loss and limb coldness. This should encourage a discussion on early recognition  differential diagnoses  and management of aortic dissection. 
Aortic Dissection,10,80,Case Report: Aortic Dissection   Patient Information:  Name: Mr. James Williams Age: 67 years old Sex: Male  Race: African American Occupation: Retired Civil engineer  Past Medical History:  Mr. Williams has been treated for hypertension for the past 15 years and has kept it relatively controlled with medication  diet  and lifestyle changes. He also suffers from hyperlipidemia and is a former smoker  having quit twenty years ago. He has had no previous surgeries or hospitalizations. He does not have a family history of heart disease.  Present Complaint:  Mr. Williams came to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden severe chest pain that started about 2 hours ago. He describes it as a sharp  tearing sensation that radiates to his back and seems to be intensifying. He denies any recent trauma or heavy lifting prior to the onset of symptoms. Additionally  he reports symptoms of light-headedness  nausea  and sweaty palms  but negates any shortness of breath  cough  or fever. He doesn't recall any similar episodes previously.   Social History:  Mr. Williams is widowed and lives alone. He is a social drinker  consuming about 3-4 units of alcohol per week  and denies any illicit drug use. He is fairly active  engaging in regular walks and light exercises.   This case is designed to represent the typical case of aortic dissection  which more frequently affects males and is associated with ages over 60. The African American population and individuals with a history of hypertension are at an increased risk. The acute onset of severe chest pain described as 'tearing' that radiates to the back is a key symptom reflective of an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,81,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Demographic Information: Patient: Mr. J.D. Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired Engineer  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension controlled on meds from age 55 2. Two pack per day smoker for 50 years 3. Family history of heart disease 4. Cholesterol controlled on meds from age 60  Chief Complaint: The patient arrived complaining of sudden  severe chest pain.  History of Present Illness: Mr. J.D. is a retired engineer who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset chest pain. Pain began two hours before presenting to the ED. Describes pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping """" radiating to his back between his shoulder blades. Denies any recent trauma or injury. Pain is not relieved by positional changes or any other approaches. The patient looked anxious and sweated profusely.  Note: The Age  Sex  Race  and medical history are consistent with risk factors for aortic dissection  a condition markedly higher in men  those over 60  African-Americans  and prominently related to hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol and family history of heart diseases. The patient's key complaint  severe chest pain with a tearing or ripping sensation  is a classic clinical characteristic of aortic dissection.  Through this case  medical students should understand the typical symptoms and risk factors associated with aortic dissection and the immediate steps necessitated to confirm diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment. Subsequent focus on echocardiography  computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to diagnose  and treatment involving blood pressure control and possible surgical intervention would complete the training case."
Aortic Dissection,10,82,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Mr. Samuel Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and high cholesterol.  Reason for Visit:  Mr. Johnson presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe chest and back pain described as tearing or ripping  that started approximately 2 hours ago. He also mentions a notable difference in blood pressure between his left and right arms.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago but has been inconsistent with his anti-hypertensive medication due to concerns about side-effects. He has been a heavy smoker (2 packs per day) for the last 30 years. He was also diagnosed with high cholesterol five years ago but has not taken any cholesterol-lowering medications due to financial constraints. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 65. He has one older brother who currently has uncontrolled hypertension.  Social History: Recently retired  Mr. Johnson previously worked as a bus driver. He continues to smoke heavily  consuming approximately 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He admits to low levels of physical activity and a diet rich in fried foods and red meat. He doesn't consume alcohol excessively and denies any illicit drug use.  Risk Factors: Several risk factors for aortic dissection should be emphasized to students. These include history of hypertension  smoking  advanced age  male sex  and high cholesterol levels. It is important to note that African-Americans have a higher incidence rate of aortic dissection  likely due to a higher prevalence of hypertension.  Presenting Complaints: Key symptoms the students should focus on are the sudden onset of severe chest or back pain  described as tearing or ripping  and discrepancies in blood pressure between the arms. Other potential symptoms include shortness of breath  fainting  heavy sweating  nausea  and signs of shock. However  these may not always be present in all patients.   Clinical guidance: A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis as aortic dissection although not very common  may be fatal if not diagnosed promptly. Initial evaluation should include a thorough history  physical examination  and appropriate diagnostic imaging such as a CT scan. Management would often require emergent surgical repair but may vary based on the type of dissection and overall patient condition.
Aortic Dissection,10,83,"Patient Information: Mr. John Thompson  a 67-year-old African American male  with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and tobacco use. The patient is a retired automobile mechanic  and he lives alone. He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications and has a 30-pack year smoking history.  Chief Complaint: The patient reports sudden onset of severe back pain  described as """"tearing"""" in nature  since 3 hours.  Case Presentation: Mr. Thompson presented to the emergency department with acute  severe  tearing chest and back pain that radiated to his abdomen. The pain started while he was carrying groceries. He also reported feeling dizzy and faint. He is normally quite active and has not experienced symptoms like this before. The patient’s blood pressure at admission is elevated  there are differences in the pressures observed in each arm  and a faint diastolic murmur is noticed on his cardiac examination.  Past Medical History: Medical records indicate that he has been diagnosed with hypertension for over 10 years but is inconsistent with his medication. He's also been advised repeatedly to quit smoking.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Based on his severe  sharp chest pain  the acute onset of symptoms  and his demographic and medical history  aortic dissection is suspected.   Teaching Topics: This case could be used to discuss typical presenting symptoms  methods of confirming the suspected diagnosis  potential complications  and treatment plans for aortic dissection. We can discuss the importance of blood pressure control and its implications in the prevention of cases such as aortic dissection. Students should also understand how to educate patients about the adverse effects of smoking and hypertension. The moment should also be seized to discuss healthcare disparities and the importance of cultural competence in healthcare."
Aortic Dissection,10,84,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. A.B. is a 62-year-old African-American male  working as a construction supervisor.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 8 years and has been a smoker for about 40 years. He also has a mild renal deficiency along with a high cholesterol level which was noted in his last annual check-up. His father succumbed to heart disease in his early 60s.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. A.B. came to the emergency department (ED) with acute  severe chest pain that started about an hour ago. He described the pain as a tearing sensation localized in the anterior chest and radiating towards the back. The patient also reported suffering from mild shortness of breath and feeling anxious.  This case was selected considering the literature evidence where the incidence rate of aortic dissection is alleged to be higher among African-American males  older adults  smokers  and those with hypertension and high cholesterol levels. Moreover  a family history of heart disease increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders. The symptoms presented by Mr. A.B. are typical for aortic dissection  i.e.  abrupt and intense chest pain with a ripping or tearing sensation and anxiety. Yet  the physician should rule out other pathologies—such as myocardial infarction—that can present with similar symptoms.
Aortic Dissection,10,85,Case Report Title: Understanding Aortic Dissection in an Older African-American Male  Subject: Mr. James  a 72-year-old African-American male  Past Medical History: Mr. James has a well-documented history of hypertension  smoking (35 pack-years)  and hyperlipidemia. He does not have diabetes  a family history of heart disease  or any history of connective tissue disorders. Mr. James is compliant with his antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily) and statin (Rosuvastatin 20mg daily).  Presenting Complaints: Mr. James presented to the emergency department (ED) with a reported sudden  intense chest pain described as tearing in character and radiating to the back. Accompanying symptoms included a shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and near-syncopal episodes.   Medical literature shows that African-American men have higher rates of hypertension and aortic dissection than others. They are often underrepresented  and addressing this specific demographic allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse patient population. The case is designed to illustrate common risk factors (hypertension  smoking  hyperlipidemia) and typical presentations of aortic dissection. The aim is to increase the students' diagnostic suspicion required to combat the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
Aortic Dissection,10,86,Case Report:   Patient Demographics:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 63 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired Plumber - Location: Urban Midwest  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for 10 years  irregularly medicated with Lisinopril - Type 2 Diabetes mellitus for 7 years  managed with Metformin. - Smoker: 1 pack/day for 35 years - Occasional Alcohol consumption  - 1 prior episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) about 3 years ago - No known allergies   Key complaints:  Mr. Doe reported to the emergency department describing severe  sharp chest and back pain that started suddenly about 2 hours ago. The pain began while he was at rest  watching television. He describes the pain as a tearing or ripping sensation radiating from his anterior chest to his back  and progressing to his upper abdomen. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  sudden onset sweating  and dizziness. No history of trauma or injury.   This fictitious case is representative of key risk factors and demographic patterns seen in aortic dissection. African American men especially have been reported to have a higher risk of this condition. Age  tobacco use  hypertension  and a history of circulatory issues like TIA are among leading causes  along with genetic factors not indicated here. This case scenario should provide a helpful training resource to illustrate a typical presentation of an aortic dissection.
Aortic Dissection,10,87,"Patient Case:  Patient Information: Mr. Lewis  a 65-year-old African American male  working as a retired high school principal.  Past Medical History: Confirmed chronic hypertension  with inconsistent management over the past decade. Family history reveals a father who died at the age of 70 due to a myocardial infarction. A non-smoker but drinks alcohol moderately. No previous surgeries. Body mass index (BMI) has ranged within overweight (27-30) for the past 15 years.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Lewis visited the emergency department with a sudden severe pain in his chest and back  which he described as """"tearing"""" in nature. He also reported dizziness  nausea  and shortness of breath. His blood pressure reading was enormously different in each arm  and he appeared pallid and sweaty.  Clinical Reasoning: The combination of a sudden onset of severe  tearing chest and back pain  differences in blood pressure between the arms  and history of hypertension suggests a high likelihood of aortic dissection. This condition more often affects males over 60  with hypertension being the leading risk factor. There is a higher prevalence among African American males  although it is a disease process that can affect any race or ethnicity. This profile matches perfectly with our patient. However  other diseases  such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  should be considered.  Additional Information: Terrifying pain often is a characteristic symptom that leads patients with aortic dissection like Mr. Lewis to seek emergency care. They might arrive in shock because the dissection has caused aortic regurgitation  leading to cardiac tamponade. In Mr. Lewis’ case  his reported dizziness  sweating  and feelings of faintness might be associated with this.   Remember  this condition is a medical emergency with high morbidity and mortality rates. Teaching case like these help medical students recognize and respond promptly to such clinical emergences.   Suggest going forward with medical imaging such as Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis."
Aortic Dissection,10,88,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. Joseph Rodriguez is a 62-year-old Hispanic male. He is a retired automobile mechanic and currently resides in Miami  Florida with his wife. He consumes alcohol socially and is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago.   Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia  for which he has been prescribed medication. However  his blood pressure control has been inconsistent  often fluctuating in clinics. His lipid profiles reveal elevated levels despite regular statin therapy. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his older brother recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. A year ago  he experienced a minor stroke but made a full recovery following rehabilitative therapy. Additionally  he is overweight (BMI:30.4) with no known history of diabetes or other endocrine disorders.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Rodriguez was rushed to the emergency department presenting with a sudden onset  intense chest pain radiating to his back. He described the pain as “tearing” and it started while he was lifting a heavy box. The pain is not eased by rest or nitroglycerin  and it's the worst pain he's ever felt. This was accompanied by profuse sweating and he reports a mild shortness of breath. His wife also reports that he appeared pale and was visibly shaken by the pain.  The case provides a realistic scenario of a patient at high risk of aortic dissection  given his male gender  age  and uncontrolled hypertension. Traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis such as hypercholesterolemia and a family history of cardiovascular diseases are also present. His Hispanic ethnicity takes into account the demographic representation in the literature showing a lower prevalence of aortic dissection in this group compared to non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks  thereby challenging the stereotypical patient archetype and encouraging broader critical thinking. The intriguing nature of this case mainly lies in the fact that despite his significant cardiovascular risk factors  he has never reported experiencing anginal chest pain before.
Aortic Dissection,10,89,Case Report: Aortic Dissection   Patient Demographics:  64-year-old African-American male. Occupation: Retired electrician. Lives alone in a suburban environment. Smoker for 40 years  approximately 1 pack a day. Moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of high blood pressure and peripheral artery disease. His M.D. has been regularly prescribing antihypertensives. There is no known familial history of aortic dissections noted but he has a deceased brother who passed away suddenly in his 60s  reason undetermined. Patient exhibits poor medication adherence due to forgetfulness and financial constraints.   Key Complaints:  The patient came to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of severe  knife-like chest pain radiating to his back  described as the worst pain he has ever felt  starting approximately 2 hours prior to presenting. He also complained of shortness of breath and profuse sweating. No reported nausea  vomiting or dizziness. The pain did not improve with rest or nitroglycerin taken at home. He denied any trauma or heavy lifting before the pain.  Note: Aortic dissection is most commonly found among middle-aged and elderly men  particularly among the African American population. It also often occurs in those with a history of high blood pressure and tobacco smoking. Based on literature  we opted to make non-adherence to medication an issue because it is a significant real-world challenge in the management of chronic conditions.   This case is simplified and abbreviated for educational purposes. In real-life  several additional clinical  lab  imaging investigations and differential diagnoses would normally be considered.

He is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife and they have two grown-up children. He has a 20-year history of poorly controlled hypertension and has been a smoker for over 30 years. He has no known drug allergies.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Walker complained of sudden onset severe chest pain that started an hour ago. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" in nature  with the intensity as 10/10. Initially  the pain was localized to the anterior chest and later radiated to his back between the scapulae.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Walker has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 20 years  however  due to inconsistent medication adherence  it has remained largely uncontrolled. He does not have any history of diabetes mellitus  ischemic heart disease or hypercholesterolemia. He has also undergone surgical repair of a hernia 10 years ago with no postoperative complications.   Social History:  Mr. Walker has been a heavy smoker since his early 30s  smoking 1.5 packs per day. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He admits to having a diet high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables. He lives a sedentary lifestyle with little to no physical exercise.   NOTE:  This case is clinically relevant as it represents an important emergency pathology - aortic dissection  commonly seen in hypertensive patients with a greater prevalence amongst Black men. It emphasizes the devastating consequences of untreated hypertension and the importance of timely management. It also encourages learners to recognize the crucial differences between chest pain due to aortic dissection vs. other causes  thereby focusing on clinical reasoning  differential diagnosis  and medical decision-making.   Please customize this case as needed to fit your instructional objectives and learners' levels."

His length is 178cm and weight 86kg  with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.1 kg/m2. He is a lifelong resident of Detroit  MI. He admits to having smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years  although he stopped 3 years ago. He is moderate alcohol drinker.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension diagnosed for about 10 years and type-2 diabetes for the past 5 years  both being managed with medication (Lisinopril and Metformin respectively). He was also diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 7 years ago and is on statin therapy. He had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago and since then  has been advised to take aspirin daily as a preventive measure. No history of any surgeries or any known allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient attended the emergency department reporting a sudden onset  severe chest pain which he also felt in his upper back. The pain was described as sharp  like being torn or ripped apart. The onset was sudden without any precipitating factors and it did not relieve with rest. The pain was associated with feeling of faintness and mild shortness of breath. There was no associated nausea  vomiting  or sweating. He denied any history of fever  loss of consciousness  palpitations  or weakness in any body part.  This case represents the demographic mostly affected by aortic dissection which include older males  African Americans  those with hypertension  and smokers. It aligns with accompanying diseases  such as hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and high cholesterol  as well as symptoms – severe  sharp chest  or upper back pain  described as a tearing sensation  and concurrent symptoms such as shortness of breath  faintness which may sometimes present in such cases.   Please note: Aortic dissection is relatively rare  and the above representation is based on commonly reported demographic trends in medical literature. However  it might vary and can also present in any individual irrespective of these demographics.

He's a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He lives with his daughter and grandchildren but maintains his independence.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the years. His blood pressure readings have consistently been above 150/90 despite being on antihypertensive medications. He stopped his regular follow-ups with his cardiologist due to transportation issues.   He was treated for type 2 diabetes for the past 5 years with oral hypoglycemics. His last HbA1c was about 7.0% 6 months ago. Moreover  his family history includes his father who died due to a stroke at the age of 72.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain radiating to his back. He described it as the worst pain of his life. It was associated with shortness of breath  weakness  and a sense of impending doom.   Teaching Points:  This clinical vignette provides an opportunity to delve into the presentation and management of aortic dissection. Students should recognize that risk factors in this patient presented include long-standing  poorly controlled hypertension  and male gender. They should also appreciate the life-threatening nature of this condition  and understand the urgent need for investigation via imaging and subsequent surgical intervention.   Further  this case can also be used to draw attention to the importance of effective patient communication and the challenges posed by social determinants of health  as evidenced by this patient's sporadic follow-ups due to transportation issues.
Aortic Dissection,10,94,Patient Information:   Mr. James Lee  a 62-year-old African American male.  Past Medical History:  Previous history of high blood pressure and smoking  which he quit five years ago. He also has a family history of aortic disease  with his father having suffered an aortic dissection at 65.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Lee presented to the emergency department reporting sudden onset of severe tearing pain in his chest radiating to his back  beginning around two hours ago. He has also noted a missed or irregular pulse and general feeling of anxiety.  Literature Reference:  According to available clinical literature  the prevalence of aortic dissection is higher in males than in females and African Americans are at a higher risk than other races. Also  hypertension  smoking  and family history of aortic disease are significant risk factors for aortic dissection.  Note:  This patient represents a picture perfect case of aortic dissection given his gender  race  age  and his past and family medical history. The severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back is a characteristic symptom of aortic dissection. This brief simulation  thus  aims to help educate medical students on what to look out for in a typical presentation of an aortic dissection patient.
Aortic Dissection,10,95,"Case Report for Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male. He is a retired truck driver and a veteran. His height is 5'10"""" and he weighs 210 lbs. He resides in rural Georgia with his wife of 45 years. The literacy level of the patient is high school education. He quit smoking 10 years ago but used 1.5 packs a day for more than 40 years. Moreover  he drinks socially - usually a couple of beers during family gatherings on weekends.  Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history includes a clinical diagnosis of hypertension which has been controlled on medication for the last 20 years. He suffered from myocardial infarction 12 years ago and has been on regular follow up with cardiology. He has also Type 2 diabetes  controlled with metformin  for the past 10 years.  For the past 5 years  he has had a mixture of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia  which are managed by statins. Occasionally  he has episodes of chronic lower back pain caused by lumbar spondylosis  but he refused surgical intervention and wanted to control it conservatively with postural correction  exercises  and NSAIDs when necessary.  Key Complaints:  The patient came to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to the back. He described the pain as 'tearing' in nature. This was not like the chest pain he experienced during his previous heart attack. There were no accompanying symptoms like nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or palpitations. His blood pressure was found to be significantly different in the two arms. His wife also mentioned that he seemed confused and his speech was slightly slurred just before they arrived at the hospital."
Aortic Dissection,10,96,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: - Patient X is a 66-year-old African American man from urban areas. - He's a retired mechanic  living alone since his wife passed away a couple of years back. - He has smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for the past forty years. - He is not a habitual drinker but does consume alcohol socially. - He has no known allergies.  Past Medical History: - Patient X is a known hypertensive for the past fifteen years and has been on antihypertensive medication (Amlodipine) inconsistently. - He was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 5 years ago and is on statins. - He does not have a known history of diabetes or any cardiac disease. - There is no family history of cardiac disease. - His most recent blood pressure on a regular check-up six months back was 165/95mmHg. - He has associated obesity with a BMI of 30.  Key Complaints: - Patient X presented to the emergency department with a sudden severe sharp (like 'tearing' or 'ripping') chest pain that started about an hour ago. - The pain is primarily in the anterior chest area and radiates to the back. - He also states that the pain seemed to move downward. - Shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and symptoms of anxiety are present. - No complaints of any loss of consciousness  weakness or paralysis  palpitation  or anginal chest pain. - No associated abdominal pain  nausea  or vomiting. - He denies any previous episode of a similar kind.  Note: This case represents demographic groups at a higher risk of aortic dissection  including the older age group  males  African Americans  smokers  hypertensives  and those with high cholesterol levels. The advancing age  male gender  race  and unhealthy lifestyle (smoking) are all risk factors for aortic dissection. Moreover  poor control of blood pressure and high cholesterol levels also significantly contribute to this life-threatening condition. The key complaints are also typical of aortic dissection  which is often described as severe 'tearing' or 'ripping' pain that radiates to the back.
Aortic Dissection,10,97,"Case Report:  Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  35 year-long smoking habit  high total cholesterol  and obesity who presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe """"tearing"""" chest pain. He describes the pain as radiating from the front of his chest  through to his back between his shoulder blades.  Patient History:  Mr. Johnson's hypertension has been managed with hydrochlorothiazide for the last 15 years and he reports compliance with his prescribed therapy. Despite repeated medical advice  he has been unable to quit smoking or lose weight. His cholesterol has been historically unstable despite treatment with statin therapy. He reports no known allergies and his family history includes a brother who suffered a heart attack in his early 60s.  Key Complaints:  His primary concern is sudden  severe chest pain that is different from any pain he has ever experienced. The pain started abruptly about an hour before presenting to the ED. Mr. Johnson reports a history of occasional minor chest discomfort with exertion  but he had never experienced pain this intense before and explains it feels like """"something is tearing"""" inside his chest. The pain radiates to his back and is not relieved with rest or change in position. He denies symptoms of shortness of breath  cough  fever  nausea  vomiting  palpitations  or diaphoresis.   Conclusion:  Considering Mr. Johnson's background  sudden chest pain of severe 'tearing' nature  and its radiating pattern  a strong clinical suspicion for aortic dissection needs to be kept in mind. As a next step  appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be pursued promptly. Therapeutic intervention should follow in order to prevent fatal complications such as cardiac tamponade  organ ischemia or aortic rupture.  This case as illustrated ensures diverse representation as African Americans have been noted to be particularly predisposed to hypertension  a major risk factor for aortic dissection. Additionally  studies indicate elevated rates of aortic dissection occur in males over the age of 60  and smokers."
Aortic Dissection,10,98,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  hailing from a middle-income background. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. His body mass index (BMI) is 28 m/kg2  which indicates overweight. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases but no personal history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J had been largely healthy with no significant previous hospitalizations. He was diagnosed with moderate hypertension about two weeks ago and was prescribed anti-hypertensives. However  compliance with medication has been poor. He also had a gallstone surgery about ten years ago.  Key Complaints:  Mr. J presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe pain in his chest and back. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" that began about 2 hours earlier while he was gardening. It has been continuous and increasing in intensity since then. There were no other symptoms like shortness of breath  syncope  or abdominal pain.  Reasoning Numerous studies have shown that aortic dissection is more prevalent in males and older adults  usually 60s and 70s. Racially  African-Americans have been found to have a higher rate of hypertension  a risk factor for aortic dissection  compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Furthermore  patients with aortic dissection often recall significant emotional or physical stress shortly before the beginning of the symptoms  hence the inclusion of gardening. The demographic data and specificities of this case were composed bearing all these realities in mind.   Learning Objectives: 1. Recognition of aortic dissection and its presentation. 2. Understanding the importance of risk factors in aortic dissection like hypertension and age. 3. Consciousness about the challenge of diagnosing aortic dissection as the symptoms and clinical features can mimic other medical conditions. 4. Learning to prioritize aortic dissection as an immediate medical emergency that requires a quick diagnosis and treatment.   References:  Clouse WD  Hallett JW Jr  Schaff HV  et al.

Aortic Dissection,10,99,Case Report:  Demographics and Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson  a 69-year-old African American male  recently retired  presents for evaluation. He has a medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  despite medication  and high cholesterol. Mr. Thompson also has a 20-pack year smoking history but quit smoking ten years ago. His father died at an early age due to sudden cardiac death.  Key Complaints: Early in the morning  Mr. Thompson woke up with an intense  tearing chest pain radiating to the back  between his shoulder blades. He described it as the worst pain he has ever experienced  reaching maximum severity almost instantly. Along with the pain  he also reports experiencing shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom. On arrival at the emergency department  Mr. Thompson was found to be diaphoretic  anxious  and pale.   Physical Examination:  Initial vitals showed BP 160/95 mmHg on right arm and 145/90 mmHg on left arm; heart rate was 105 beats/min  respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  oxygen saturation 92% on room air  and the body temperature was normal. Physical examination revealed that the patient had unequal brachial and radial pulses.  Initial Epidemiologic considerations: Aortic dissection is most common in men  especially men of African American descent  often between 60 to 70-years of age. Hypertension is a common risk factor  present in 70-90% of cases. Also  a history of smoking substantially raises the risk of aortic dissection.  Diagnostic testing: Given the patient's concerning symptoms  physical exam findings  and relevant personal and family medical history  immediate diagnostic testing was performed to confirm suspected aortic dissection. These tests include electrocardiography (ECG)  chest X-ray and subsequently  a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.
Aortic Dissection,10,100,Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male  named Mr. Johnson. He lives with his wife in a suburban area and he recently retired from his job as a school teacher. The patient has two adult children and 4 grandkids.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and is on regular medication. He is also a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has borderline diabetes that is being managed by diet and lifestyle interventions. He does not have any known drug allergies. He has no history of any surgical interventions.  Key Complaints: Today  Mr. Johnson presents himself to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden  severe  sharp  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back between his shoulder blades. He mentions the pain started a few hours ago  and it is unlike any other pain he has ever experienced. He states he felt a sudden sharpness followed by an intense pain while he was doing yard work. The pain was not relieved by rest. He also reports feeling clammy  light-headed  and having a sporadic pounding heartbeat.  Aftermath: Potential complications such as cardiac tamponade  aortic valve insufficiency  or organ ischemia were considered  given the key complaints and medical history. Moreover  the awareness of Mr. Johnson's hypertension rendered him a potential candidate for an aortic dissection. The medical team decided to promptly investigate the condition under these suspicions.  This case report is created considering demographic representation. The prevalence of aortic dissection is relatively high among African American individuals  and data show that hypertension is an important risk factor. Additionally  the condition disproportionately affects males  especially those over the age of 60. The presentation of abrupt  severe  tearing chest pain also aligns with a typical first symptom of aortic dissection. This case scenario can be built on to include physical exam findings  diagnostic workup  and management plan to provide medical students a comprehensive understanding of aortic dissection.
