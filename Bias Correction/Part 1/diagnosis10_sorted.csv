Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,1,"Title: Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Good day everyone   Today  we present the case of Mr. John Smith  an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a history of a symptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This patient's profile is consistent with known epidemiology. According to literature  most cases of AAA are found in Caucasians  and the risk of aneurysm increases significantly after age 65.  Mr. Smith  a retired engineer has been a smoker for the last 60 years and is known to have developed high blood pressure for which he has not been optimally compliant with his antihypertensive medications. He also reports significant alcohol use  which together with smoking and hypertension puts him at higher risk for AAA as per literature.  Mr. Smith’s past medical history is significant for peripheral vascular disease and ischemic heart disease  having had a PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) about 5 years ago. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercholesterolemia. These previous cardiovascular disorders  along with smoking  are commonly associated with the occurrence of AAA in the male population aged 65 years and older per the literature.  Now  let's take a look at the patient’s presentation. Mr. Smith came in complaining of a nagging pain spanning from his abdomen to his lower back  which he mentioned felt different than his usual """"aches and pains"""". On examination  a palpable mass was detected in the abdomen with a characteristic pulsation. His vitals were stable at the time of examination.  In terms of diagnostic evaluation  we confirmed the AAA with an abdominal ultrasonography  which revealed an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm consistent with an AAA.  In conclusion  the patient's age  sex  race  history of smoking  hypertension  and previous peripheral and heart disease places him at significantly increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. His AAA is a crucial finding and the care team should proceed with urgency given the risk and implications of rupture.  This case  in summary  brings to light the vital link between demographics  lifestyle habits  and existing co-morbidities in the occurrence and progression of an AAA. It also underscores the importance of compliance to treatment for disorders like hypertension and the necessity for lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation  both of which play a significant role in AAA management.  Thank you for your attention. Let's discuss this case further."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,2,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  I. Introduction We present the case of Mr. Richard Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  representative of the highest risk category as per demographic distribution for AAA in the literature. According to Mosquera et al (2020)  white males aged 65–75 years have the highest prevalence of AAA  while African Americans have the lowest.  II. Presenting complaint Mr. Smith was referred by his general practitioner to our vascular surgery clinic with a newly diagnosed AAA  detected during an abdominal ultrasound performed for unrelated symptoms of dyspepsia. He has been asymptomatic in terms of AAA symptoms.  III. Past Medical History His medical history is significant for Hypertension for the past ten years and he is a current smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history  each being major risk factors for AAA development. Mr. Smith does not have a family history of AAA  making genetic predisposition unlikely in his case. His lifestyle includes minimal physical activity but he has a balanced diet. He doesn't have diabetes  which paradoxically  according to De Rango et al. (2014)  can have a protective effect against the development of AAA.  IV. Conclusion In summary  Mr. Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male smoker presenting with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm  identified incidentally during an ultrasound carried out for dyspepsia. His past medical history of hypertension and a high smoking index places him at an increased risk for AAA-related complications. His next steps include a detailed evaluation to decide on either surveillance or surgical intervention  depending on the aneurysm size and risk score.   References: 1.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,3,Slide 1: Introduction:  Subject of today's presentation is a patient presenting with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   Slide 2: Patient's Summary:  Our patient is a Caucasian male  aged 70  hailing from a middle-income urban setting. In alignment with the literature  Caucasian males over the age of 65 display the highest prevalence rates for AAA.  Slide 3: Patient’s Medical History:  His past medical history subjects: - Hypertension which he's managing with medication - A 50-year pack of smoking history  which is common among many AAA patients as tobacco use is directly related to the development and rupture of AAA. He quit smoking 10 years back.  - Family history of cardiovascular diseases  specifically AAA in his elder brother. Familial predisposition and genetics do play a significant role in the development of AAA.  Slide 4: Clinical Features:  He is symptomatic with classic symptoms of severe  sudden pain in his lower abdomen and back  feeling pulsating enlargement resistant to pressure in the abdomen  syncopal conditions  and general health degradation for the last few weeks.  Slide 5: Diagnosis:  He underwent an ultrasound revealing a large AAA of 5.8 cm in diameter. It is essential to measure the diameter  as the risk of AAA rupture increases once the aneurysm grows above 5.5 cm.  Slide 6: Management:  His management included an immediate surgical consult. Given his age and the size of the AAA  doctors opted for an elective surgical intervention to prevent rupture.  Slide 7: Conclusion:  The patient represents an important demographic group for AAA - older  Caucasian males with a history of smoking. His case underlines the importance of early detection  particularly in patients with a high-risk profile which includes a family history of the disease  hypertension  and significant smoking history. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,4,Title: Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction  We would like to present the case of a patient diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) seen in our internal medicine ward.  Demographics and Past Medical History  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a recent record of pulmonary disease and hypertension. His primary language is English. He is a retired car mechanic. The patient is an ex-smoker  having quit about 10 years ago  with a 35-pack year smoking history. He reported moderate alcohol use and denies illicit drug use.  The patient’s family history is noteworthy for heart disease - his father died of myocardial infarction  and his mother suffered from hypertension. He has one brother who had an AAA repaired 5 years ago.  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension for the past 20 years  adequately managed with medication  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease following his smoking habit  and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Presentation  The patient visited the Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic complaining of a pulsating feeling in his abdomen and lower back pain. He described the pain as dull and constant  5 on a 10-point scale  and he denied any aggravating or relieving factors. No symptoms of claudication  extreme fatigue or unexplained weight loss were reported.   The patient is 5’9” tall  weighs about 210 lbs (BMI: 31 kg/m2)  blood pressure was found to be 146/92 mmHg  heart rate of 78 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal area. No bruits were detected over the mass.  Conclusion  Considering the patient's demographic data  past medical history  habits  and age  he falls into the most common risk group for AAA  i.e.  Caucasian male  over 65  with familial history  smoking history  and hypertension.   The diagnosis was confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound  which showed a 5.5 cm aneurysm in the infra-renal portion of the abdominal aorta. The patient was educated about the need for immediate surgical intervention due to the risk of rupture and was admitted for an elective open surgical repair.   This case exemplifies the typical presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  emphasizing the importance of early detection and management  given the risk of an aortic aneurysm rupture  which carries a high mortality rate.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,5,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Good day everyone  I would like to present to you a case of a patient who has been diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired electrician and lives in a retirement facility. The patient is socially active  a non-smoker  and rarely consumes alcohol. He has been married for 47 years and has three adult children.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension since his mid-forties and is currently managed on hydrochlorothiazide. He was also diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia at the same time and manages it with simvastatin. He experienced an ischemic stroke at the age of 68  with a good recovery and minimal residual neurological deficit. There is no known history of aortic aneurysm in his family.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden-onset abdominal and back pain which started an hour ago. He describes the pain as sharp  radiating to his lower back and  unlike anything he has experienced before. Associated symptoms include mild dizziness and shortness of breath. There have been no changes to his bowel habits  and he denies any nausea  vomiting or fever.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the abdomen. His blood pressure was found to be slightly lower than his usual readings  and the pulse was rapid but regular. Initial laboratory workup showed slightly elevated white blood cell count and normal kidney function.   Conclusion: Based on the patient’s age  sex  the sudden onset of symptoms  the location and nature of pain  and physical findings  he was suspected to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The diagnosis was confirmed with a Computed Tomography (CT) scan that showed a 7cm diameter abdominal aortic aneurysm  which indicates a high risk of rupture. Immediate surgical intervention was recommended.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are more common in males and those above 65 years old. Important risk factors include smoking  hypertension  family history  and peripheral artery disease. This case reflects the typical demographic and risk factor profile seen in AAA patients and the workup that confirms the diagnosis. The sudden onset of severe abdominal and back pain in an older patient  particularly with a pulsatile abdominal mass  necessitates an immediate investigation for AAA.  Thank you for your attention. I am available now for any questions.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,6,Title: Presentation of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Introduction The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer  presenting with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is married  a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol occasionally. The patient resides in a suburban area and reports living a relatively sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Medical History The patient's medical history reveals the presence of multiple risk factors for AAA. He has hypertension  controlled with medication (Losartan 50mg daily). His lipid profile reports elevated LDL cholesterol levels  and he has been on statin therapy (Simvastatin 20mg at bedtime) for the past five years. He has a history of intermittent claudication - pain in his legs on exertion  which is relieved by rest. The patient also reports reduced appetite and unintended weight loss over the past two months. There is no history of diabetes  renal disease  or any other significant chronic illnesses. No known drug allergies. Family history significant for father dying in his 70s from 'ruptured artery'.  Symptoms Today  the patient reports experiencing a constant  unsettling pain in the lower back and abdominal region  which he describes as deep  throbbing and different from any he's experienced before. He rates the pain as a 7 on a scale of 10 and explains the pain does not seem to radiate or shift. He denies any recent trauma to the area.   Conclusion The patient's age  male gender  family history  and presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and high cholesterol  along with the mentioned symptoms  strongly suggest abdominal aortic aneurysm. Though men over 65 who have ever smoked are most at risk for AAA  cessation of smoking and control of blood pressure can help manage the condition. This patient will require an immediate diagnostic workup for further evaluation and treatment planning. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,7,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: I present Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who has been brought in complaining of a pulsating feeling in his abdomen accompanied by constant and severe abdominal and back pain.  Background and Demographics: Research indicates that approximately 80% of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) occur in males over the age of 65. Caucasian populations are also more susceptible  with Hispanic and Asian populations having the lowest rates. Our patient's age  gender and race  therefore  aligns closely with the typical demographic profile for this disease.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a former smoker and has been managing hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for the past 15 years. For both conditions  he has been on medication (ACE inhibitors for hypertension  and statins for hypercholesterolemia). His family history reveals that his father passed away due to an AAA rupture in his late sixties. Mr. Smith's smoking history  age  the presence of cardiovascular disease  and family history are significant  as they are recognized risk factors for developing an AAA.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith describes feeling a throbbing sensation in his abdomen for the past couple of weeks  which he initially assumed was related to digestive issues. Today  however  he reports the onset of sudden and severe pain in the middle and lower parts of his abdomen and back. He denies any associated nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel movements. He also reports feeling lightheaded recently. The nature and location of his pain  his lightheadedness  together with his demographics and medical history  raise a high suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  As the case is presented  further investigations such as an ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT) scan would be recommended to confirm this preliminary diagnosis and assess the size and location of the aneurysm. It's also crucial to evaluate signs that might indicate imminent rupture  given the severity of his symptoms and his father's medical history. The goal must be to stably manage the patient and prevent rupture if confirmed AAA is in its early and intermediate stages. If the AAA is at significant size or any signs indicate a risk of rupture  surgical intervention may be necessary.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,8,Presentation  Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting from his primary care's office.  Chief Complaint: The patient reports experiencing a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain  accompanied by lightheadedness and a rapid heart rate.  Demographics: The patient is a retired military officer  a lifetime non-smoker  moderate drinker  and has an active lifestyle including regular exercise. He has a well-rounded diet but a family history of cardiovascular disease. He is currently living independently with his spouse.  Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia about five years ago  which is under control with medication. The patient also experienced myocardial infarction ten years prior  which was managed with angioplasty and a stent placement. He is currently on medication including a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  a statin (Rosuvastatin)  and a daily aspirin. His most recent blood work had shown elevated cholesterol levels  slightly above his target range.   Present Illness: The patient has been healthy until about 4 hours before his admission when he experienced a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The pain is described as sharp  constant  and radiating to his lower back. He also reports feeling lightheaded  which made him see his primary care physician immediately.  Conclusion: This patient's complaints may signify a potentially life-threatening condition like an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which is common among older Caucasian men  particularly among those with a history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.  Plan: An immediate imaging study (such as a CT scan or ultrasound) is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of AAA. Should AAA be confirmed  the patient must be immediately referred to the vascular surgery team.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,9,"Title: A Case Presentation with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Subject: Mr. Green  a 72-year-old Caucasian male.   Introduction:  Mr. Green presented at the hospital today with severe abdominal pain. He is a retired construction site foreman living in a suburban residential setting and is a nonsmoker. As per CDC's report  individuals aged 65 and older  males  and Caucasian demographic are at the highest risk of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) and Mr. Green’s symptoms suggest a possible AAA.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Green has a significant medical history relevant to his current possible diagnosis. He has been diagnosed with hypertension and atherosclerosis  both of which are potential risk factors for developing an AAA. His blood pressure is well-controlled with medications (Lisinopril)  and he takes low-dose Aspirin for his cardiovascular disease. He does not have any known allergies to medication. It is to be noted that he has got a family history of AAA  as his father passed away due to an AAA rupture at the age of 75. Mr. Green's lipid panel conducted six months ago showed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  a potential risk factor for AAA.  Social History:  Mr. Green is a widower who lives with his daughter. He is a nonsmoker and a social drinker. He has a limited exercise routine primed by general flexibility and strength workouts. He follows a balanced diet but loves indulging in sugary delicacies on weekends.   Current Condition and Symptoms:  Mr. Green reports severe  sudden-onset abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back. He also complains of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  similar to a """"heart beating."""" There is no history of trauma. He has never had similar symptoms before.   Potential Diagnosis: Considering his past medical history  age  ethnicity  typical clinical symptoms  and risk factors such as hypertension  high LDL-C levels  atherosclerosis  and family history of AAA  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is strongly suspected.   Further assessment will focus on confirming the abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosis and staging its severity. This will typically involve a physical examination  a detailed medical and family history  and diagnostic tests such as an ultrasound or CT scan.   Management and plan: If confirmed  the treatment approach will depend upon the size and rate at which the aneurysm is growing. Patients with smaller aneurysms may require careful observation and regular monitoring. However  patients with larger or rapidly growing aneurysms might need surgical intervention.   Our next steps will include initiating conversations with Mr. Green about the potential diagnosis and arranging for appropriate diagnostic tests. We will also consider referring him to a vascular surgeon for further management."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,10,Subject Title: A Case Presentation on a 65-year old Caucasian Male Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year old male of non-Hispanic  Caucasian ethnicity. He is retired  lives with his wife in a suburban locality  and is a current smoker with a smoking history of about 40 years. He has no known drug allergies. He has a BMI of 27 and is mildly obese.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  controlled through medications. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease five years ago and had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) performed. There is also a family history of cardiovascular disease  as his father passed away at the age of 57 due to myocardial infarction. No history of diabetes  peripheral vascular disease  liver disease  kidney disease or stroke. He frequently drinks alcohol  indicative of a lifestyle quite associated with common risk factors.  Current Symptoms: The patient presented with a newly noticed pulsating mass in the mid-upper abdomen  associated with a dull ache in the lower back region. No complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  or lower extremity edema. No presenting signs of hypotension  claudication  or limb ischemia  suggestive of rupture or dissection.  Initial Presentation: On physical examination  a palpable  pulsating mass around 3 cm in diameter is found in the epigastrium region. Abdomen is soft  non-tender  and bowel sounds are normal. No auscultated bruits. No visible distention  and no signs of peripheral cyanosis or pallor. His vitals are stable with blood pressure recorded as 140/90 mm Hg  heart rate - 78 bpm  respirations – 16 per/min  and temperature – 98.7 F.  In concordance with the patient’s demographic and clinical presentation  this fits well to the epidemiological data around Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm which is more prevalent among Caucasian males  in the age group 65-75 and closely associated with smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. His complaints and examination findings further raise the suspicion of AAA.   Course of Action: The patient has been advised for an urgent abdominal ultrasound and other necessary cardiovascular investigations  including blood profile  for the confirmation and assessment of AAA. Contact with a vascular surgeon has been initiated for pre-operative assessments in case surgical interventions are needed. The patient is also referred to a smoking cessation clinic to help manage his risk factors better.   Conclusion: From the case-specific factors and risk stratification  it can be observed that the patient falls under a high-risk category for AAA. Prompt diagnosis and management  screening for other possible atherosclerotic diseases and lifestyle modifications need to be part of this aging male's comprehensive care plan.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,11,Title: Clinical Presentation of A Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: The presenting patient is Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired engineer living with his wife in a suburban community.  Medical History: Mr. Doe is a former smoker  having quit a 10-year  one-pack-per-day smoking habit 20 years ago. His medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been controlled for the last 15 years with a regimen of beta-blockers and diuretics. His father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 84. Mr. Doe's BMI is 27  indicating that he is slightly overweight. Additionally  he enjoys a diet high in fats and cholesterol  and has an irregular exercise routine. There is no history of diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease. He consumes alcohol socially.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Doe visited his GP with complaints of dull constant pain in his lower back and abdominal area for the past two weeks. The pain occasionally radiates to the groin area and is not associated with any particular food intake or physical activity. He reports no changes in bowel habits  urinary symptoms  weight loss  or appetite.  Provisional Diagnosis: Given the patient's age  gender  history of smoking  hypertension  high-fat diet  family history  and consistent pain in the abdomen and back  there is a suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Epidemiological Data: AAA has a propensity to be asymptomatic until rupture. AAAs are most commonly found in males aged over 65 years  predominantly in those of Caucasian ethnicity. The risk factors present in our patient — age  gender  hypertension  smoking history  and family history — support this diagnosis.  Conclusion: While AAA is a life-threatening condition  early identification provides a good prognosis. Mr. Doe's demographic profile and symptoms warrant further diagnostic examinations  such as ultrasound  CT scan  or MRI  to confirm the AAA diagnosis and establish the aneurysm's extent. Once confirmed  a treatment plan including possible surgery  lifestyle changes  and close watch for any aneurysm growth will be implemented.  References: Li.  X. & Zhao.  J. (2018).

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,12,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation   Slide 1: Presentation  Patient: Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and back discomfort  persistent over the last week. The pain is a dull ache that is intermittent but recently has become constant.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson has been hypertensive for 25 years  managed by antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril). Additionally  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago and is currently on Atorvastatin. Patient has a 40 pack-years history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. No known history of any other systemic disease.   Slide 3: Patient Distribution in Literature   Research shows that the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is higher in older male populations  particularly those of Caucasian descent  with traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history. Our patient Mr. Johnson  hence  falls into the high-risk category.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation  At presentation  Mr. Johnson appears uncomfortable due to pain. On examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable in the abdominal region. The severity of his symptoms and clinical presentation raise concern for an impending rupture of AAA.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests  Laboratory findings indicate an elevated white cell count (leukocytosis) that suggests possible inflammation/infection. An abdominal ultrasound reveals an aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm in diameter  confirming the diagnosis of AAA.    Slide 6: Conclusion   Given Mr. Johnson's age  gender  racial background  and past medical history  he embodies the typical demographic profile of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. His current clinical presentation  along with diagnostic findings  confirms the diagnosis of AAA. The large size and associated symptoms warrant urgent medical attention to prevent life-threatening complications such as aortic rupture.   Slide 7: Management & Follow-Up Care   Immediate surgical intervention is required  likely endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  to manage the large  symptomatic AAA. Postoperatively and in the long term  it is crucial for Mr. Johnson to adhere to his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications and maintain regular follow-up appointments for the surveillance of his cardiovascular health. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,13,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a newly identified suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm. He is a retired steel mill worker and resides in a rural setting with his wife. He has history of heavy smoking for the past 40 years  although he quit smoking 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Johnson initially presented with vague abdominal pain that was primarily observed in the mid-abdominal region radiating towards the back. He also reports experiencing occasional bouts of mild to moderate back pain. There was no noted trigger or particular character to the pain  nor could pain be linked to any food intake or physical activity.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been on medication for the same for a decade. He has had no prior surgeries and has no known allergies. The patient is also at risk for cardiovascular diseases due to his previous habit of heavy smoking.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having passed away from a heart attack at a relatively young age. His older brother underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 73.  Behavioral History: He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and moderately. His diet is moderate in fat and salt.   Physical Examination: The patient is alert  oriented  and vitally stable. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the epigastric region. Blood pressure was consistently higher on the right arm compared to the left.  Given the patient's age  sex  history of tobacco use  presence of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and family history of AAA  he falls into a high-risk category for abdominal aortic aneurysm. This underlines the need for further investigation and management strategy to prevent devastating complications such as rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,14,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction to Case Study  Mr. Clifford Smith  an 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents today complaining of unexplained and persistent lower back pain  abdominal pain  and slight nausea. Upon further probing  he reveals his father underwent surgery for an aortic aneurysm at age 75.  Slide 2: Patient Profile  To elaborate  Mr. Smith is a retired school teacher who lives independently. He is a widowed father of three children who  thankfully  do not report similar complaints. Mr. Smith has a 45-year history of cigarette smoking  though he quit five years ago  and currently  he drinks alcohol occasionally.   Slide 3: Medical History  Mr. Smith has a 10-year history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are well-controlled by medications. He is also being managed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and had a myocardial infarction 8 years ago.  Slide 4: Social and Family History  Previously mention of his father’s aortic aneurysm is raising concern  coupled with his smoking. The patient leads a relatively active lifestyle and has maintained a healthy diet.   Slide 5: Current Presentation  Over the last week  Mr. Smith has been experiencing a sharp  constant low-back pain and  more recently  nausea. No changes in bowel movements. The pain does not radiate  but it intensifies when he stands or walks around.  Slide 6: Current Examination  Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass and slight tenderness in his lower abdomen. His vital signs are stable  but an abdominal bruit is audible.  Slide 7: Presumption and Next Steps  This cumulative picture  compounded by his personal and family history  social habits  and current physical findings  suggests the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Laboratory tests and a confirmatory CT are warranted to substantiate this suspicion.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Given the risk factors and symptoms  there is a high suspicion for AAA in Mr. Smith. Early detection  surveillance  and appropriate intervention  can prevent catastrophic outcomes associated with ruptured AAA. Patient education is similarly crucial  given the hereditary nature of AAA.   Slide 9: Acknowledgments  Appreciate the contribution of multidisciplinary teams in managing case and the field's continuous efforts in understanding AAA.   Slide 10: References  Citations from relevant literature on abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,15,"Title: A Case Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  I. Demographics  The patient is Mr. Wilson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired  lives alone in a suburban community  and was previously engaged in an office-based job. Throughout his career  he was mostly sedentary  following a typical western diet throughout his life without regular physical activity.  II. Presenting Concerns  Mr. Wilson arrived at the emergency department complaining of severe  persistent back pain  which he describes as """"tearing"""" accompanied by light-headedness and sweating. On examination  we noticed a pulsating mass in his abdomen.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. Wilson has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  primarily managed through medication for over 15 years. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for about 45 years before he quit 10 years ago. He also has a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction in his late 60s and his brother having undergone an aortic aneurysm repair.  IV. Reason for Presentation  The type of pain Mr. Wilson describes along with the exam findings are indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture or dissection  a life-threatening condition that requires immediate surgical attention. Risk factors such as age  male gender  Caucasian race  smoking history  and family history are consistent with what literature suggests regarding those most at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms. His hypertension and high cholesterol  coupled with an insufficient physical exercise regimen  may have influenced the development of his aneurysm.  V. Discussion  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more prevalent during the sixth and seventh decades of life  being about 4-6 times common in men than women. They are also more common among Caucasians. Key risk factors are age  family history  smoking  and atherosclerosis. In many cases  like Mr. Wilson's  these aneurysms might not cause noticeable symptoms until they rupture leading to life-threatening internal bleeding. The intense back or abdominal pain  together with a pulsating abdominal mass  is conventionally considered an ominously sign indicative of an impending or current rupture.  By observing Mr. Wilson's case  it is clear how essential it is to identify and manage the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. Detection and appropriate management of aneurysms and their risk factors can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.  In summary  having access to a patient's comprehensive medical history  evaluating their symptoms to ensure early detection  and implementing effective treatment strategies can play a pivotal role in improving the prognosis of patients like Mr. Wilson with abdominal aortic aneurysms."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,16,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient: Mr. Smith  Age: 73 Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Residential Location: Rural Midwestern USA   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith arrived to the hospital with complaints of intermittent lower abdominal discomfort and low back pain over the course of six months.   Background Information: He is a former machine shop worker and has been retired for eight years. He lives with his wife in a rural Midwestern community.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith's medical history reveals he is a former heavy smoker with a 50-pack-year history but quit smoking a decade ago upon his physician's advice. He has a known diagnosis of high blood pressure  managed by a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor. He also has a history of high cholesterol and is currently on statin therapy. He also has mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  possibly due to his extensive smoking history.   Family History: His older brother died suddenly at the age of 75 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Present Illness: Since his retirement  Mr. Smith has reported no significant weight loss  fever  or reduction in appetite. But his recurring abdominal and lower back discomfort raised concerns. His abdomen was pulsating upon physical examination and an abdominal ultrasound confirmed a 5.6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.   This case is typical  as AAA is most common in men between the ages of 65 and 75  particularly among Caucasians. The risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  COPD  and positive family history are also consistent with the demographics of patients commonly diagnosed with AAA.   In this case  the AAA has reached a size threshold that makes surgical intervention strongly considered to prevent rupture. The patient has been referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,17,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics:  Our patient under discussion is a 72-year-old male of Caucasian descent  named Mr. John Turner. He hails from a mid-income socioeconomic background and has been residing in the suburban region of Atlanta  Georgia for past several years. Mr. Turner is a retiree with a history of occasional alcohol consumption and long-term tobacco use which dates back to at least 30 years. In terms of familial background  hypertension and heart diseases prevail in his lineage.  Summary of Past Medical History:  Mr. Turner has a documented medical history of high blood pressure for which he has been prescribed anti-hypertensive medication and low dose aspirin. In 2007  he underwent a gallbladder removal operation due to gallstones. He also suffers from Hyperlipidemia and has been under lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy for the same.  The patient claims to have maintained an exercise regimen for over a decade  and he follows a balanced diet as advised by a nutritionist. Recently  he has been experiencing unexplained weight loss and decreased appetite.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Turner has recently begun seeking medical assistance for persistent and almost debilitating abdominal pain that radiates towards his lower back. He reports a pulsing sensation in his abdomen akin to a heartbeat. The pain and discomfort have been erratic but intense  keeping him awake at night or disrupting his daily activities.  From a literature perspective  Mr. Turner's demographic profile of being an elderly  white male with a history of hypertension and smoking aligns with the major risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The manifestations  including the pervading abdominal and back pain  pulsing sensation in the abdomen  and unexplained weight loss  further bolster the probability of AAA.  In light of these factors  we suggest Mr. Turner to undergo immediate radiologic examinations such as ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) to check for the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Conclusion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are life-threatening if ruptured. Therefore  early diagnosis and appropriate intervention are crucial  particularly for individuals who fall within the high-risk groups like Mr. Turner. If an aneurysm is confirmed  Mr. Turner may require endovascular surgery or open aneurysm repair  in parallel with management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Note:  This presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is not exhaustive and other symptoms such as lethargy  dizziness  or fainting spells could also be valuable indicators. Each patient could present differently and should be evaluated holistically.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,18,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of long-term smoking and uncontrolled hypertension. He comes in complaining of intense abdominal pain off and on for the last three weeks. The pain is dull  a constant gnawing feeling  which radiates to his lower back. The patient denies any fever  nausea  vomiting  weight loss  or changes in bowel habits. He also reported a noticeable pulsing feeling in his abdomen.  On examination  the patient appeared slightly pale and anxious. An abdominal examination reveals a palpable pulsatile mass in the middle and lower part of the abdomen. Upon auscultation  a vascular bruit is noted. There’s no evidence of abdominal bruit or renal bruit. There is no peripheral edema and peripheral pulses are equal and symmetrical in all four limbs.   He reports no previous surgeries but his medical history is pertinent for coronary artery disease  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  all of which were managed with suitable medications. He admits that he has been a heavy smoker for about 50 years and consumes alcohol occasionally.   The demographic information of the patient is typical for abdominal aortic aneurysms as it is most commonly seen in Caucasian males over the age of 65. Risk factors include a positive family history  long-term smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease. He has been advised for immediate hospital admission for further investigation  monitoring and suitable management plan.   Immediately ordered is a Contrast-enhanced CT Scan of the abdomen and pelvis for the confirmation of the suspected diagnosis and to determine the size and exact location of the aneurysm. Patient and family has been made aware of the serious nature of this potentially life-threatening condition and the need for possible surgical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,19,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Caucasian Male   I. Patient Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith with a delayed presentation. He is 6' tall and weighs 200lbs  giving him a BMI of 27.1. The patient lives in a rural area of Indiana  is a retired steelworker  and his family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. He is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago  with a 30-pack-year history. He consumes moderate alcohol.  Mr. Smith is a widower with two adult children. One of his sons succumbed to coronary artery disease in his 50s. The patient is independent in his activities of daily living and denies recent falls.  II. Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a history of coronary artery disease for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 7 years ago. He has hypertension managed with Lisinopril and Atenolol  and he also has dyslipidemia for which he takes Simvastatin. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on Metformin. He is regular on his medications. There is no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  asthma  stroke  chronic kidney disease  or liver disease.  III. Presenting Issue Mr. Smith came in today complaining of intermittent and vague abdominal pain with some radiating discomfort to his back. Review of systems was negative for gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. There were no associated complaints of shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  weakness  palpitations  or fever.   IV. Conclusion  In summary  Mr. Smith is a retired Caucasian male with a high risk of cardiovascular disease  given his age  gender  history of smoking and family history. He presents with abdominal pain  which may be consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm given his demographics and past medical history. This suspicion necessitates further investigation with an abdominal ultrasound.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,20,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Presenting today is Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who belongs to the demographic group most commonly affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). He is a retired military officer  a lifetime smoker with a 50-pack year history  and drinks alcohol occasionally. He is currently living alone and manages his day-to-day life independently.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a notable past medical history  which significantly includes hypertension controlled with medication. He also reports a past history of intermittent claudication and coronary artery disease. There is family history as well; his father died at age 65 due to reported 'aortic rupture.' He has been non-compliant with his regular health screenings which includes abdominal ultrasound  despite his doctor recommending them due to his father's history and his significant risk factor for AAA - smoking.  Presenting Complaint: Currently  he has been experiencing a subtle and constant pain in his lower back and abdomen  which he initially associated with aging. The pain has progressed over the past two months and has started to affect his quality of life. His intestinal functions are largely unaffected. He denies any related symptoms such as recent weight loss  changes in appetite  or fever.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  he has a non-tender  pulsatile mass palpable in the umbilical area  suspecting towards AAA. His peripheral pulses are equal bilaterally.  This case presentation clearly demands an immediate investigation for the suspicion of an AAA  with the risk of rupture being of immediate concern. Credentialing his significant risk factors  a definitive diagnosis must be made using the appropriate imaging modality and a suitable treatment plan devised promptly thereafter.   Such a case represents a classic AAA presentation typically seen in elderly males. It highlights the need for aggressive screening and counseling for high-risk individuals such as avid smokers and those with a family history of AAA. Mr. Smith will definitely require a multi-disciplinary approach that involves cardiology  gastroenterology  and vascular surgery for a comprehensive care and follow-up plan.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,21,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired from a career in construction. He has a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years but quit smoking five years ago. According to data from the United States  Caucasian males above the age of 65 have shown a higher predisposition to AAA.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient was brought into the ER with complaints of severe  sudden onset of abdominal pain  characterized as tearing and radiating to his back along with a faint feeling and sweating. Recent research highlights that patients with AAA commonly present with these symptoms.  Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension controlled with medication  hyperlipidemia  and a history of moderate alcohol use. He has been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease earlier. He denies any significant family history of AAA. Studies have shown that hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease are substantial risk factors for AAA.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was noticed near the umbilical area. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats/min  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Literature reports that in most cases of AAA  a pulsatile mass is often palpable in the abdominal region.  The above medical history coupled with the physical examination and symptoms led to a suspicion of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Further diagnostic tests were ordered which confirmed the presence of AAA.  In conclusion  the patient’s demographic details  history of smoking  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease  coupled with his presenting symptoms and physical examination findings  are consistent with the common presentation of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,22,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient   Patient Presentation: The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a known medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  reflecting the major risk factors stated in the literature  including age  gender  history of cardiovascular disease  and smoking.   The patient presents with a feeling of pulsating sensations around his abdomen  which he describes as uncharacteristic. Moreover  he expresses concerns about intermittent  and recently  more frequent  episodes of intense abdominal  back pain  and tenderness. These symptoms  in literature  are often associated with an enlarging or rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   The remainder of his medical history reveals no history of surgical procedures  diabetes mellitus or renal disease but reports a family history of AAA. His grandfather on his mother’s side passed away due to complications related to AAA rupture. He lives alone and is a retired manual laborer. He has been smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years  consumes alcohol moderately  and has a diet lacking adequate fresh fruits and vegetables.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is in obvious discomfort due to the abdominal pain. He is not jaundiced or cyanosed. On auscultation  a soft bruit is heard over the umbilical region. His radial and pedal pulses are palpable and normal. Pain is elicited upon palpation of the abdomen which also revealed a pulsatile mass  which is usually not palpable unless an AAA is present.   In older male patients with a history of smoking and hypertension  clinical suspicion should be high for AAA  prompting immediate diagnostic confirmation and management. In this case  the patient's age  sex  family history  and current symptoms strongly indicate AAA as a potential diagnosis.   Follow-Up and Management: The patient was sent for an immediate ultrasound of the abdomen and referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management.   This case serves as a reminder that abdominal aortic aneurysm  although asymptomatic in its early stages  can present with serious symptoms upon enlargement or rupture. Risk factors such as male sex  advanced age  smoking history  and hypertension should increase clinical suspicion  prompting immediate investigation and management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,23,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Presentation: Mr. John Doe  a 73-year-old male Caucasian patient  presented with consistent  throbbing pain in the lower left side of his abdomen for the past 48 hours. He also mentions experiencing lower back pain  which he initially attributed to his age and previous back injuries. Doe is primarily sedentary; due to being retired  he has a low physical activity level. He is also a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history  but he quit smoking 10 years ago.  Complete demographic information: Doe was born and raised in Portland  Oregon  USA  which is where he currently resides. He's a retiree  having worked as an electrician for 35 years. He lives alone since his wife passed away five years ago. His children live close by and visit him regularly. He has a sufficient income drawn from his retirement savings and social security  has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Past Medical History: His past medical history includes congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  for which he takes prescribed medications regularly. He also has a history of back injuries due to a fall from a ladder about 15 years ago. His regular medications include diuretics  beta-blockers  and bronchodilators.  In terms of family history  there's a history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 68  and his older brother recently underwent a bypass surgery for coronary artery disease.   The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is higher in older males and in those of Caucasian descent  according to the literature. Other risk factors our patient has include his history of smoking and cardiovascular disease  both of which are strongly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Given the symptoms presented  it is crucial to consider an abdominal aortic aneurysm as a possible diagnosis and further investigations such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiography should be pursued promptly.  This case underscores the importance of clinical vigilance in managing elderly patients with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Early recognition  timely intervention  and holistic management of these patients can significantly improve their quality of life and longevity.

Slide 6: Preliminary Diagnosis  Considering the patient’s age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels  his abdominal pain  lower back pain  and pulsating sensation in the abdomen  a preliminary diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is made.  Slide 7: Additional Diagnostic Tools  To confirm the diagnosis  an abdominal ultrasound will be conducted to visualize the aorta. If necessary  a CT scan or MRI may also be employed.  Slide 8: Risk Factors  Strong risk factors in this case include advanced age  male gender  history of smoking  presence of hypertension and high cholesterol levels  and family history.  Slide 9: Conclusion  Understanding these risk factors and making an early diagnosis is essential for effective management of abdominal aortic aneurysm and can significantly reduce the mortality rate from aortic rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,25,Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Profile: Mr. Abraham Henderson is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired marine engineer  a resident of Alabama. He lives with his wife and is an active smoker with a 50 pack-year smoking history. He consumes alcohol occasionally and follows an average diet. He has been under observation for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years. His BMI is 28 and he does not exercise regularly.   Presenting Complaints: He presents with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain and a pulsatile mass in his abdomen  which he has been experiencing for the past week.   Past Medical History: Mr. Henderson has a significant medical history including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 10-year history of tobacco use post-diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ten years ago. He has been on antihypertensives and statins for the last ten years. His father  a smoker  passed away due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 80.  Clinical examination: On examination  a pulsating mass was palpable in his abdomen  indicative of an aneurysm. All other organ systems showed no significant abnormalities.   Diagnosis Assumption: Based on his presenting symptoms  medical history  risk factors (age  gender  smoking  hypertension  and family history)  and physical examination  Mr. Henderson is suspected to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A confirmatory test such as Aorta Ultrasonography or CT scan has been planned.  This case illustrates the importance of routine screening  focusing on comorbid conditions  individual risk and lifestyle changes in older adults for AAA.  P.S: Demographics and other details are based on the epidemiological findings indicating that AAA is most commonly found in older men (>65 years)  have smoked  have a history of hypertension or hyperlipidemia  and in individuals of Caucasian ethnicity.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,26,Patient Presentation  Introduction:  Today  we discuss Mr. Joseph Sullivan  a 71-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This case was selected as AAA overwhelmingly affects older males  particularly those of a Caucasian background. The prevalence of AAA increases with age and is usually found among men aged 65-75 years.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Sullivan visited the clinic with a complaining of a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  alongside chronic back pain. On some instances  he experienced sudden  intense abdominal pain.   History of Present Illness:  The patient’s symptoms have been lingering on for the past 6 months  initially dismissing it as a minor case of back pain. However  the escalating severity of the pain and constant pulsating sensation in his abdomen led him to seek medical consultation.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Sullivan has a significant past medical history  being a long-term smoker with close to 40 pack-years. He also has a documented history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both being risk factors for AAA. There is no known history of AAA in his family. As a former construction worker  he's led a fairly active lifestyle  yet with poor dietary habits.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he was found to have an irregular abdominal mass that pulsates with the heartbeat. Additionally  he appears mildly distressed due to abdominal pain.  This case displays a typical presentation of AAA with its most common risk factors: age  male gender  smoking  hypertension  and Caucasian ethnicity. Considering the risk of rupture  timely identification and appropriate management of AAA are crucial to decrease morbidity and mortality rates associated with this condition. Further imaging tests would need to be conducted to confirm AAA and its size. If the diagnosis is confirmed  management could range from surveillance to surgical intervention  depending on the size of the aneurysm and symptomatology.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,27,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Slide 1: Title: Patient Demographics - Patient : Caucasian Male  Age: 72 years - Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer  - Place of residence: Urban area  Midwest United States  Rationale: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are the most common type of aortic aneurysm and are particularly prevalent in older  Caucasian men. Literature suggests that the incidence is significantly high in urban areas and among the white population[1].  Slide 2: Title: Lifestyle & Social History  - Smoking History: Ex-smoker  quit 10 years ago - Alcohol: Chronic mild alcohol use - No illicit drug use   Rationale: Studies have found strong correlations between AAA development and a past history of smoking and moderate alcohol usage[2].  Slide 3: Title: Family History - Father died at 68  cause of death: Ruptured AAA - Mother deceased at 80 from natural causes  Rationale: Family history is a prevalent risk factor associated with AAAs[3].  Slide 4: Title: Past Medical History - Hypertension controlled with medications - High cholesterol managed with diet and medications - Previous history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  Rationale: Hypertension  high cholesterol  and PAD are all common comorbidities associated with AAA[4].  Slide 5:  Title: Current Presentation - Symptom: Intermittent severe abdominal and back pain. - Physical Examination: Abdominal distension with a palpable pulsatile mass.  Rationale: A large percentage of AAA patients are asymptomatic; however  the most common symptoms when present are intermittent severe abdominal and back pain  and a pulsatile mass on physical examination.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,28,Presentation of Patient  Our patient  Mr. Johnson  a 75-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Demographics  Epidemiological studies indicate the demographics most likely to be affected by AAA are Caucasian males over the age of 60. It is estimated that 4-7% of Caucasian men over 60 are affected. Smoking is highly correlated to AAA development. Mr. Johnson has a history of smoking  having smoked a pack a day for nearly 40 years  though he quit smoking 10 years ago. His ethnicity and age place him in high-risk demographics  and his smoking habits further increase this risk.  History and Current Condition  Mr. Johnson came in complaining of abdominal and lower back pain that has persisted for a few weeks. He was initially seen by his personal physician for the pain. However  his doctor ordered an ultrasound because he detected an unusually pulsating mass in his abdomen during a routine examination.  The ultrasound revealed an AAA. This particular aneurysm is larger than 5cm  which falls into the potentially dangerous sizes  given the risk of rupture is significantly higher in aneurysms over 5cm. He reports no history of trauma  and his Family history is significant for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and heart disease. Mr. Johnson also has a history of hypertension.   Additionally noted in Mr. Johnson's past medical history includes COPD  likely correlated with his long history of smoking  as well as hyperlipidemia  managed by statin medications. He had a knee replacement surgery approximately 3 years ago with no complications.  Clinical Reasoning  Given his reported symptoms  age  ethnicity  medical history  and results from the ultrasound  Mr. Johnson's chronic lower back pain and abdominal discomfort are likely due to the large AAA  which needs immediate attention. He is at a high risk of rupture due to the size of the aneurysm  which can potentially cause life-threatening internal bleeding.  Plan of Action  The current plan is to admit Mr. Johnson for close monitoring. A vascular surgeon will be promptly consulted for further management. The potential damage an AAA rupture could cause makes it crucial that these steps are taken immediately to prevent potentially fatal complications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,29,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile Name: Mr. Allen Brown Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Rural Oklahoma  Medical History Mr. Brown is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for over 20 years. He was a smoker for about 30 years  ceasing 20 years ago  with a 30-pack-year history. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease a decade ago  which warranted a coronary artery bypass graft. Mr. Brown also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases - his father died due to a myocardial infarction and his elder brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was surgically repaired.  Current Presentation For the past one week  Mr. Brown has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain along with back pain. In addition  he reports some occasional lightheadedness and general malaise. The nature of the pain is described as a deep  constant ache that seems to radiate to his lower back. He denies having similar pain episodes in the past. There has been no weight loss  fever  or any changes in bowel habits.   Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass is noted in his abdomen. Initial ultrasound imaging indicates approximate measurements of the aneurysm to be over 5.5 cm  indicating potential need for a surgical intervention.  Conclusion Mr. Brown’s age  sex  race  and medical history  including his history of smoking  are highly in line with the literature on the risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm  which primarily affects older Caucasian males with a history of cardiovascular disease  hypertensive individuals  and smokers. Taking into consideration the size of the aneurysm  his ongoing symptoms  and the presence of multiple risk factors  immediate medical consultation with a vascular surgeon is necessary to determine the best course of action  potentially endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  to prevent the possible rupture of the aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,30,Subject presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The pain is described as sharp  tearing  and radiating to the back suggesting a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He was visiting his primary care physician for a physical examination when the pain started.  Medical history:  The patient’s past medical history is significant with a 45-year pack history of smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerosis. He quit smoking 10 years ago  but had a very significant smoking history which may have predisposed him to the development of AAA. He has been hypertensive for about 15 years  which is relatively controlled with medication (Lisinopril). Also  he has diagnosed atherosclerosis  marking significant atherosclerotic disease which is often associated with AAA.  Family history:  The patient's father died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm  so there is a family history of AAA  another risk factor.  Observations:  On physical examination  the patient's blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  pulse 105 beats/min  and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Physical findings include a pulsatile abdominal mass that is tender to touch.   Background:  The literature indicates that abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in older Caucasian men  those with a family history of AAA  and those with a history of smoking  making this patient at very high risk. Pathophysiology is complex  but atherosclerosis  inflammatory processes  and genetic predispositions play a role. Prognosis can be grave if an AAA ruptures  with a survival rate of under 20%.  In conclusion  this patient's age  sex  race  past medical history  and family history place him at a significant risk for AAA. His sudden onset  severe  tearing abdominal pain with radiation to the back  and the discovery of a pulsatile abdominal mass strongly suggest an AAA rupture. Immediate surgical intervention is required in this case.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,31,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  retired Army veteran who lives with his wife in a suburb of Dallas  Texas. He has a history of smoking  specifically about one pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years or so. Despite multiple counselling sessions regarding the behavorial change for smoking cessation  he has not been successful in quitting. It's also worth noting that Mr. Smith enjoys a moderate alcohol intake  accompanied by a diet that is high in cholesterol and saturated fats. He was previously employed in a high-stress occupation and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history significant for hyperlipidemia  hypertension  peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  and coronary artery disease (CAD)  for which he underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) a decade ago. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus about fifteen years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic medication since then. He also has been on regular medication for his high blood pressure. He has no history of other major illnesses or hospitalizations. His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in his 70s and his mother lived into her 80s without significant health issues. There's no family history of stroke or other vascular diseases.  Present Issues:  Mr. Smith recently presented to the emergency department with acute severe abdominal and lower back pain. The pain was sudden in onset  non-radiating and wasn't associated with any other gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination  a pulsating mass was felt in the abdominal area.   Given his demographic background along with the nature and location of his symptoms  there is a high degree of suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Clinical examination findings have been further corroborated with imaging tests like abdominal ultrasound and CT angiography.   According to literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common in Caucasian males over the age of 65  with a history of smoking  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol. Mr. Smith's profile fits closely with this demographic. His presentation and history correlate well with the epidemiological pattern observed for individuals with AAA  and his military background may have subjected him to additional risk factors associated with stress and lifestyle habits. His genetic predisposition  given his father's history  also raises his risk for AAA significantly. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,32,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Patient Introduction Mr. Joseph  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints of persistent and severe abdominal pain. He is a non-Hispanic individual working as a retired engineer.  Slide 2: Chief Complaint Mr. Joseph reports a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain that began approximately 24 hours ago. The pain is described as sharp and severe  radiating to the lower back.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Joseph has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes medication. Additionally  he has a 45-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily  but he successfully quit 10 years ago. There is no known family history of cardiovascular disease.  Slide 4: Current Physical Examination On physical examination  he is in mild distress due to abdominal pain. Vitals: Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg  pulse: 88 beats per minute  respiration: 16 breaths per minute  and temperature: 98.6° F (37° C). Abdominal palpation reveals a pulsating mass in the center of the abdomen.  Slide 5: Representation in Literature The literature indicates that males over the age of 65  smokers  hypertensive  and Caucasian individuals are at the highest risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. Mr. Joseph's demographic profile and past medical history  therefore  place him at a higher risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Slide 6: Conclusion - Preliminary Diagnosis Given the patient's persistent abdominal pain  vital signs  physical exam findings  past medical history  and demographic risk factors  it is prudent to explore further diagnostic testing for a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are key to improving the prognosis in such cases. An ultrasound or abdominal CT scan is suggested for definitive diagnosis.   Slide 7: Follow-up and Management If an abdominal aortic aneurysm is confirmed  the appropriate surgical or endovascular intervention will be discussed with Mr. Joseph  considering his overall health status and the size of the aneurysm. Follow-up counseling on lifestyle modifications such as adopting a healthy diet  engaging in regular physical activity and blood pressure management would also be instituted to prevent the progression of the disease. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,33,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile:  Mr. Roberts is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He has a significant medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a 10-year pack history of smoking  with the last encounter of smoking being 5 years ago. He is retired and lives alone  with children living out-of-state. He has been on a prescribed regimen of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Roberts was asymptomatic of AAA and the discovery was incidental during a routine abdominal ultrasound check-up for his hypertension. The scans revealed an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.1cm.  Patient’s History:  Mr. Roberts has a history of cardiovascular disease  with previous surgeries including a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 6 years ago. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia have been under control with medication and lifestyle modifications. He has no known allergies. He used to smoke a pack a day for 10 years but quit 5 years ago. Mr. Roberts has no family history of AAA. However  his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and his older brother had a stroke at the age of 70.  Evaluation and Diagnosis: As the AAA is larger than 5.0cm  Mr. Roberts is at a high risk of rupture  which could be life-threatening. His current symptoms of lower back pain and occasional bouts of abdominal discomfort now makes sense and can be attributed to his aneurysm.     Treatment Plan:  Considering the size of Mr. Roberts' AAA and his medical history  the physician recommends elective surgery to repair the aneurysm. He has been referred to a vascular surgeon. In the meantime  he has been advised to maintain a healthy diet  properly manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels  and continue regular visits for monitoring his AAA.  Conclusion:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms are common among older Caucasian men  especially those with a history of smoking and cardiovascular diseases. Asymptomatic AAAs can often be missed. Hence  regular screening and monitoring are crucial  particularly in patients older than 65 with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,34,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents himself with severe abdominal pain. He has a history of tobacco usage  as he had been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years. He quit two years ago after experiencing shortness of breath.   Demographic Information: According to literature  abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is more common among Caucasian men than their African-American counterparts. It is most prevalent in individuals over the age of 65. Risk factors related to demographic characteristics include age  gender  and race. Additionally  a family history of AAA significantly increases the risk of developing one.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with high blood pressure 15 years ago  which he has managed with medication. He also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed 3 years ago. Both conditions are known to contribute significantly to the development of AAA.   There is no family history of AAA  but his father suffered a stroke at an elderly age and his mother passed away from complications of heart disease. Mr. Doe was diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) about 4 years ago. He has a high cholesterol level and a 5-year history of coronary artery disease (CAD). He underwent a bypass surgery for CAD 2 years ago. He is also obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.  Current Presentation: Currently  Mr. Doe reports experiencing sudden onset  severe  and constant abdominal pain. He is also feeling light-headed and experiences a rapid heart rate. These are significant symptoms suggestive of the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe's advanced age  gender  past smoking habit  hypertension  high cholesterol  obesity  and history of other cardiovascular diseases place him at a significant risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Based on his symptoms  immediate medical attention and further diagnostic tests are required to confirm the diagnosis and implement a management plan.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,35,Title: Patient Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  I. Patient Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  living in a suburban settings  who first presented to the hospital after experiencing severe abdominal and back pain with a history of hypertension.   II. Relevant Medical History He has a significant past medical history that includes: a 40 pack-year history of smoking  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and peripheral vascular disease. He is currently on medication for hypertension and COPD  including beta-blockers and bronchodilators. He reports sporadic compliance with his medication regimen.  III. Family History The patient reports a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and brother dying of myocardial infarctions in their early 70s.   IV. Social History He is a retired automobile mechanic  living with his wife. He quit smoking 10 years ago  he doesn't drink alcohol nor partake in recreational drug use.   V. Review of system Our patient first noticed mild lower back discomfort two weeks ago  which escalated into severe abdominal and back pain  prompting his visit to the hospital.  VI. Physical Examination Initial examination revealed that patient is in distress with diaphoresis; has a pulsating abdominal mass on palpation; profound hypotension; regular but rapid pulse; and diminished pulses in the lower extremities.  VII. Evaluation and Diagnosis Radiologic examinations  specifically an abdominal ultrasound  showed an enlargement in the aorta  indicating an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with signs of impending rupture.   VIII. Risk Factors Major risk factors present include the patient’s advanced age  male gender  significant smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of heart disease  and comorbid pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. It’s also important to note that White (Caucasian) men over the age of 60 years have the highest prevalence of AAA.   IX. Plan  Immediate surgical intervention  in the form of an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  is indicated considering both the patient's symptoms and the size of his aneurysm. After surgery  the patient will need regular monitoring via vascular imaging to ensure successful treatment and to monitor for potential complications. Lifestyle modifications and compliance with medication therapy will also be strongly emphasized to manage risk factors and comorbidities.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,36,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian male who resides in a suburban area in the Midwest  U.S. He is a retiree with a past professional life in manual labor trade. He lives with his wife of 47 years and is a father to two adult children. He is a current smoker with a 50-pack year smoking history  and his alcohol intake is occasional.  Medical History: The patient has a history of moderate hypertension and hypercholesterolemia both of which have been managed with medications for the past 15 years. Besides  the patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72.  Presenting Symptoms: He attended the consultation complaining about a pulsating feeling in his abdomen that he likened to a heartbeat  which occurs with increasing frequency  particularly after meals. Along with this unusual pulsating feeling  he has been experiencing sporadic back pain  occasional nausea  and a recent unintentional weight loss.  Clinical Examination & Imaging: Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Subsequent abdominal ultrasound demonstrated evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  with an aortic diameter of 5.3cm  higher than the normal range (usually under 3cm).  In conclusion  considering the patient's advanced age  active smoking habit  diagnosis of hypertension & hyperlipidemia  family history of cardiovascular disease  and detected aneurysm diameter beyond the normal threshold  there is a high risk of aneurysm rupture. Thus  rapid and active intervention is necessary. This case is representative of the typical demographic and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms  as outlined in medical literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,37,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient.  Patient Profile:  James is a 76-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a sudden onset of severe  tearing abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back. He describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced and states that it's intermitted with periods of relief.  He currently lives in an urban area with his wife and is retired. He worked as a truck driver for about 40 years. He is a lifetime non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol use.   Past Medical History:  His medical history reveals that James has been dealing with untreated hypertension for the last ten years and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and elder brother dying from heart attacks in their early 70s. He has a history of hyperlipidemia but hasn’t been regular with his lipid-lowering medications.   James has been experiencing mild abdominal discomfort and unintentional weight loss over the past three weeks. He has peripheral vascular disease diagnosed five years ago. No history of renal disease  liver disorder  or diabetes.   On Inquiry  James mentioned having occasional claudication after long walks but was under the impression that it was due to his age. There is no history of any significant trauma  recent surgeries  or neoplasm. He takes a daily aspirin for heart disease prevention but has no known drug allergies.  Demographic Representation:  His profile matches epidemiological data  which indicates that abdominal aortic aneurysms are most commonly seen in Caucasian males aged 65 or older with a history of smoking and hypertension. However  it should be noted that James is a non-smoker  putting emphasis on the fact that while smoking is a significant risk factor  non-smokers can also develop an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Furthermore  the presence of peripheral vascular disease and family history of cardiac ailments further contributes to his risk profile for abdominal aortic aneurysm development.   In conclusion  James' severe abdominal and back pain  combined with his medical history and demographic profile  lead to a concern for a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. Urgent diagnostic and potential surgical intervention is considered.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,38,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Middle-aged Diabetic Man  Patient Information: Mr. James Powell is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Boston  Massachusetts. He is retired from a long career in civil service  living with his wife of 40 years. Mr. Powell was referred by his family physician to our vascular surgery clinic today.  Medical History: Upon reviewing Mr. Powell's medical history  we found that he has been a Type 2 diabetic for approximately 20 years  on Metformin. He is also known to be hypertensive  which has been managed through a combination of Lisinopril and Amlodipine for the past decade. He is a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago after a 30-year pack history. There's a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65. No surgical or significant family medical history was reported.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Powell presented with a one-week history of gradual onset  unrelenting  dull abdominal pain  localized in the mid to lower abdomen. Besides  the patient has been experiencing feelings of fullness and increased abdominal girth.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His vitals were stable. Marginal tenderness was reported in the abdomen but no signs of inflammation or rebound tenderness. He had regular heart rhythm and lung fields were clear during auscultation.   Discussion: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is predominantly a disease of older men  with a reported male-to-female ratio of 4:1. Several risk factors have been linked with AAA  including advanced age  smoking history  hypertension  and atherosclerosis.  Mr. Powell's demographic aligns with the representation of typical AAA patients as found in the literature. His diabetic and hypertensive history places him at an increased risk  as does his previous smoking habit and family heart disease history.   It is worth mentioning that despite the common notion that diabetes is a protective factor against AAA  some recent studies suggest that this relationship may not be as robust or consistent as it is initially thought. It is prudent to maintain our clinical suspicion in diabetics presenting with a compatible symptom profile.   Conclusion: Mr. Powell's case is a cautionary tale reminding us not to overlook the possibility of AAA in patients with a combination of risk factors such as advanced age  hypertension  smoking history  and positive familial history  even in patients with diabetes.   Next Steps: Further imaging like an abdominal ultrasound or a computed tomography (CT) scan will be the next step to determine the exact size  location  and severity of Mr. Powell's aneurysm. Subsequently  the treatment plan (survey  endovascular repair or open surgery) will be tailored according to the evaluation results and his general health status. He will also need tight control of his blood pressure and blood glucose  with medications and lifestyle modifications. Regular follow-ups and patient education are of utmost importance in such cases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,39,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction: We present a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This case was chosen because of the high incident rate of AAA within this demographic. The patient was diagnosed with AAA via an ultrasound study during a routine check-up for his Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia.  Demographic Information: The patient is a retired teacher residing in NY city  with a 40 pack-year history of smoking. He is married with two adult children. He reports being relatively physically inactive and has poor dietary habits  with a predilection for high salt and cholesterol foods.  Past Medical History: This patient reports a history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  Both well managed with medications. He quit smoking ten years ago. There has been no known hereditary genetic disease in his family. However  the patient's father had suffered from myocardial infarction and passed away at the age of 80.   Patient's Clinical Presentation: During a routine check-up visit with the general physician  an abdominal ultrasound detected mild enlargement in the patient's abdominal aorta. The finding was suspicious for AAA  and a subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis with an aortic diameter of 4.0 cm - indicative of a small AAA. As per guidelines  surgical treatments are reserved for aneurysms of larger dimensions (>5.5cm). Therefore  patient management at this time consists of regular follow-up screenings and healthy lifestyle modifications—smoking cessation  blood pressure control  appropriate diet  and physical activity.   Conclusion: Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur predominantly in elder males  especially those with a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of vascular diseases. Thus  routine screening and lifestyle modifications are vital for this at-risk population.   Note: This case summary outlines a typical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm to demonstrate the importance of early detection and the beneficial role of non-invasive imaging in managing this population. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,40,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Older Male Patient  Patient Presentation: Mr. James  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints of persistent lower back pain and occasional abdominal discomfort. He has a history of smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. His body mass index (BMI) is 30  with a history of bad eating habits.   Past Medical History: Mr. James is a known case of hypertension and high cholesterol for which he takes regular medications. He also has a strong family history of cardiac ailments with his father having died of a stroke at the age of 65.   Clinical Examination: On examination  there was abdominal tenderness and a palpable pulsatile mass in his abdomen. The patient also reported feeling lightheaded with episodes of syncope.  This case presentation is typical of the demographic most affected by Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs)  as literature indicates a higher prevalence in older men  especially those of Caucasian ethnicity who have a history of smoking. The prevalence of AAA increases with age  particularly in those over 60 years.   Interestingly  the increased risk posed by demographic factors such as being Caucasian and male is reduced in populations over 80 years old where there is a tendency towards equal gender distribution. However  since Mr. James falls within the most at-risk demographic and presents with typical symptoms  a diagnosis of AAA is being considered and further diagnostic procedures including an ultrasound or CT angiogram will be performed to confirm this.  In relation to AAA and morbidity  studies have indicated that ruptured AAA is the 13th most common cause of death in the U.S.  and the 10th most common cause of death in men over the age of 55. This underlines the necessity of early diagnosis and appropriate management in patients like Mr. James.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,41,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation  Demographics:  Mr. R is a 70-year-old Caucasian male patient.  Chief Complaint:  Intermittent abdominal pain and back pain that has progressed over the past few months.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports non-radiating moderate intensity  intermittent abdominal pain that seems unrelated to meals. His medical history also includes complaints of a pulsating sensation in the abdomen  a noticeable pulsating mass present in the abdominal area  and unexplained weight loss.  Medical  Family  and Social History:  His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medications. Additionally  he is a former 30 pack-year smoker but quit 5 years ago. He does not consume alcohol. His father died of a myocardial infarction  and his mother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Physical Examination:  The physical examination reveals a slim man in no apparent distress. His blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg and heart rate is regular at 75 bpm. His abdomen is soft but reveals an easily palpable and pulsatile mass in the mid to lower abdomen.  Pertinent Labs & Imaging:  Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 7.3cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with possible mural thrombus.   Assessment:  Mr. R has an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which likely explains his abdominal pain and pulsating mass. These aneurysms are common in men over age 65  particularly in those with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. It is especially concerning because of his family history of cardiovascular disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Plan:  Given the large size of the aneurysm and Mr. R’s symptoms  surgical intervention is the likely next step. He needs a referral to vascular surgery for consultation regarding elective aortic aneurysm repair. The goals of treatment are to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing and treating any associated symptoms. Concurrently  his hypertension control should be optimized. He is also advised to avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting till further notice to reduce the risk of rupture.   This case presents a typical demographic and medical history associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms  highlighting the importance of monitoring high-risk individuals to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,42,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Mr. J. S. is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of heavy tobacco use  specifically an average of a pack a day for 40 years. He retired from his job as a construction worker 10 years ago. The patient lives with his wife in a suburban environment and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father experiencing a fatal heart attack at the age of 78.   Presenting complaint: Mr. J. S. currently presents for a routine follow-up visit with non-specific complaints of episodic abdominal discomfort and lower back pain over the last month. He mentions the pain as a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  not correlating to meals or physical activity.  Past Medical History: In the past  Mr. J. S. has been diagnosed with hypertension for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years ago  and high cholesterol  managed with Atorvastatin. He has no known allergies.  Social History: Mr. J. S. admits to a history of heavy smoking  but reports quitting about two years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He states that he stopped regular exercise a few years ago due to increasing shortness of breath.  Investigations: Due to the patient’s age  smoking history  related symptoms and family history of cardiovascular disease  further evaluation is warranted for a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The recommended step would be to perform an abdominal ultrasound for further assessment.  This case is representative of the typical demographic profile of a patient with an AAA. The condition is most commonly found in Caucasian males over the age of 65 with a history of smoking. Other risk factors  such as hypertension  peripheral artery disease  high cholesterol  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  further increase the chances of developing an AAA. Therefore  it is important that these factors be properly managed and monitored in such patients to prevent further complications.   In summary  Mr. J. S.’s presenting symptoms along with his demographic profile and past medical history suggest the likelihood of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the most suitable treatment approach.  
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,43,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents with complaints of constant and severe abdominal pain which he described as a throbbing sensation in the lower part of the abdomen that radiates to his back. He has also been experiencing occasional episodes of lightheadedness and sweating. Mr. Smith is a retired veteran and a long-term smoker with a smoking history of approximately 40 years.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of high blood pressure which is currently being managed with medication. In addition  he has Hyperlipidemia  a condition of high cholesterol that increases the likelihood of developing an aneurysm. There is no family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms. He also reports occasional alcohol intake. Mr. Smith has not had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations.   Demographic Information: Studies suggest that abdominal aortic aneurysms disproportionately affect the older population  particularly males around the age of 65-75 years  who comprise the majority of abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnoses. Smoking and hypertension significantly contribute to the development of these aneurysms. This  combined with his gender  Caucasian ethnicity  and age  puts Mr. Smith in the high-risk group for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Epidemiology: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs most frequently in males over 65 years of age and the prevalence increases considerably with age. AAA is more common in Caucasians than in African Americans. Smoking  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension are well-established risk factors for AAA. The disorder also tends to run in families. This presentation fits the demographic typically found in literature.   Presentation based on his demographic and risk factors  combined with the described symptoms  has a high suspicion for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  and requires immediate further investigation and treatment.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,44,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  named John Doe  now residing in an urban community in Philadelphia. He is a retired veteran who experiences moderate socioeconomic status. His past occupational exposure includes several years in a shipyard with some asbestos exposure  indirectly indicating a lifestyle with potential for high cumulative tobacco use. The patient admits to a history of smoking tobacco for 50 years but quit 10 years ago. He reports consuming alcohol socially.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a significant medical history that includes hypertension controlled with lisinopril  hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin  and he experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) three years ago. He also exhibits mild COPD from his many years of smoking. There is no documentation of diabetes mellitus or renal pathology. Family history is relevant for cardiovascular disease  with his father having suffered from an aortic aneurysm.  Current Presentation: Mr. Doe visited the emergency service complaining of a sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain  which he describes as tearing and radiating to the back. He reported feeling lightheaded and had one episode of vomiting. His vitals include a blood pressure of 180/90 and an irregular heart rate of 100 beats per minute. An Abdominal examination showed a palpable pulsatile mass and moderate tenderness.  This case presentation delineates a typical patient demographic associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms  primarily an elderly Caucasian male with a substantial smoking history. Smoking has a direct linear relation with AAA  and the likelihood increases further when coupled with male gender and age.    The medical background of hyperlipidemia and hypertension—major cardiovascular factors—significantly contribute to the risk of developing aneurysms. Although the manifestation of symptoms such as severe abdominal or back pain and syncope indicate complicated AAAs  often these are asymptomatic and detected incidentally or during screening processes. Considering the potential lethal consequences of ruptured AAA  the initial diagnosis and timely intervention are pivotal.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,45,"Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  with an address on Main street  small-town USA  has presented with complaints of constant abdominal and lower back pain. Mr. Doe  a retired manual worker  is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago after a 30-year history of tobacco use. He drinks about 10 standard alcoholic beverages weekly.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which has been under control with Lisinopril. He has been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and is on Atorvastatin. He has no known allergies and is up-to-date with his recommended preventive care and immunizations.   Family History: His father passed away at the age of 65 due to complications of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother has high blood pressure and is in her late 80s.   Review of Systems: Mr. Doe reports experiencing episodic persistent pain localized to the back and abdomen  not specific to any time of the day or night and not noticeably affected by food intake or body position. He also mentions intermittent feelings of lightheadedness but denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  lower extremity weakness  or any bowel or bladder dysfunctions.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Doe has a blood pressure level of 140/85mmHg  a heart rate of 78 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He appears on closer inspection to have a pulsating mass in his abdomen. The lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation  and cardiac examination reveals normal S1 and S2 without any murmurs or gallop.   Investigation: Given the presentation and clinical findings  a suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is raised. An urgent ultrasound confirms a 5.6 cm infrarenal abdominal aorta. A CT angiogram is planned for further evaluation.     Plans: Mr. Doe is informed about the findings  implications  and potential risk of rupture and need for urgent intervention. Vascular surgery consultation is planned. Patient is advised immediate hospital admission for monitoring and management.   References:  1. Newman AB  Arnold AM  Naydeck BL  et al.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,46,Title: Clinical Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  I. Demographics   The patient  Mr. Lopez  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  as AAA is most prominently found in this racial group aged between 65 to 75 years old. He is a retired military officer currently living with his wife and has active involvement in his grandchildren's lives.  II. Medical History   The patient has a history of smoking  which is one of the biggest risk factors for AAA. He quit smoking 8 years ago but had a 30 pack-year smoking history before quitting. He has controlled hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  which is commonly associated with AAA. Furthermore  Mr. Lopez also has a family history of AAA  as his father had an aneurysm repair at the age of 75. The risk for AAA increases with a positive family history.  III. Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Lopez has been asymptomatic  which is characteristic of many patients with AAA. However  his primary care physician noted a pulsatile abdominal mass during a routine physical examination. In a small proportion of patients  an AAA might be incidentally noted in this manner.   IV. Recent Developments   Upon suspicion of an AAA  Mr. Lopez was referred for an ultrasound imaging study  which confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.2cm. It's key to note that larger aneurysms (>5cm) like his are more likely to rupture  which is a life-threatening situation.    V. Conclusion  Now identified  Mr. Lopez will need careful follow-up and possibly surgical intervention depending on the progression of the aneurysm size and his symptomatology. He may be a candidate for either endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair. Though asymptomatic now  his AAA status raises risks of rupture  arteriosclerotic vascular disease  and death if left untreated - emphasizing the importance of timely management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,47,"Patient Presentation:  Good morning  everyone. Today we will be discussing Mr. John Hartwell  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented at our facility with symptoms consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mr. Hartwell is a retired construction worker who has a long-standing history of smoking  approximately one pack per day for the past 40 years. He also has an extensive medical history that includes hypertension which has been regulated by medication for the past 10 years.   Last week  Mr. Hartwell reported to his primary care physician about experiencing lower back pain which he described as a """"deep-seated  persistent throbbing """" especially after meals. Coupled with the fact that he also mentioned feeling a pulse in his abdomen  this raised suspicion of vascular involvement and he was referred for vascular consult to confirm a diagnosis of aortic aneurysm.  Demographically  Mr. Hartwell aligns with the common characteristics of patients who develop abdominal aortic aneurysms. This condition occurs most frequently in Caucasian males over the age of 65  with risk factors such as a history of smoking and hypertension contributing significantly to its development. Other risk factors he does not possess are a family history of AAA and hypercholesterolemia.  In summary  Mr. John Hartwell presents as a classic case of a patient with a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm  based on his demographic  lifestyle habits and presenting symptoms. As the next step  we will now need to confirm this suspicion through appropriate radiological imaging in order to guide any further intervention."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,48,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnathon  a 73-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a notable pulsatile mass in the mid to lower abdomen and intermittent abdominal and back pain. He reports that the pain is not associated with eating or any specific activity. He notices that the pain tends to be more intense during episodes of exertion. He denies any weight loss  loss of appetite  stool changes  or urinary symptoms. He characterized the pain as “tearing” and radiating to his back.  Demographics:  Johnathon is a retired steelworker living with his wife in their own home. He has an extensive smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit 15 years ago. He consumes alcohol moderately and has a fairly sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Past Medical History:  Johnathon has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been controlled with Lisinopril for the past 10 years. He also has hyperlipidemia for which he's taking Atorvastatin. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father experienced an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 70.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is appreciated just above the umbilicus. The upper and lower extremities are warm with the presence of distal pulses. His blood pressure is slightly elevated  and his body mass index falls within the overweight category.  Note:  The common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  such as advanced age  male gender  history of smoking  and history of hypertension  are all present in Johnathon's profile. Furthermore  his father's history with AAA puts Johnathon at an increased risk. The description of the """"tearing"""" pain radiating to his back is a concerning symptom often associated with aneurysm rupture  a life-threatening condition.    This case is reflective of the demographic most often affected by AAA: older  Caucasian males with a history of cardiovascular disease and/or smoking. As per data  men are much more likely to develop an AAA than women are  and whites have a higher risk than people of other races. The majority of cases also originate in individuals aged 65 and above.    Immediate diagnostic imaging for Johnathon would be prudent  given his risk factors and characteristic symptoms  to rule out a potential impending rupture."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,49,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Caucasian Male  Introduction:   The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Brown  who presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden extreme pain in his middle to lower back and abdominal region. The pain radiates to his groin and buttocks. He describes the pain as intense and constant. Mr. Brown has no history of any traumatic injury or lifting heavy weights.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and type II diabetes which are controlled with medications  and a 40 year history of smoking (1 pack per day)  although he quit 2 years ago. He has no history of surgeries or allergies.   Demographics in Context:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is most commonly seen in Caucasian males over the age of 60  with the majority of patients being between 65–75 years old. Risk factors include hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking history  and diabetes  which perfectly aligns with Mr. Brown's demographic and history  as mentioned above.   Discussion:  AAA is often asymptomatic and quite challenging to diagnose. However  in some cases  like Mr. Brown's  it presents with a sudden severe  tearing abdominal or back pain. Uncontrolled hypertension contributes to the expansion of an AAA and increased wall stress. In the presence of Mr. Brown's hypertension and history of heavy smoking  the likelihood of having an AAA increases significantly.   Conclusion:  Given Mr. Brown's sudden presentation of severe abdominal and back pain in combination with his demographic features and risk factors  it is crucial to assess the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm through immediate imaging studies. Consideration should be given to the high risk of rupture associated with his symptoms  and emergency surgical evaluation should be considered.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,50,Title: Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Brown is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who seeks medical evaluation for the intermittent abdominal discomfort he has been feeling for the past few weeks. He is originally from the Midwest  and currently resides in the same region with his wife. He is a retired farming engineer and his primary language is English.  Medical History: Mr. Brown has a submitted extensive past medical history which includes high blood pressure for which he's been on medication (ACE inhibitors and diuretics) for the past twenty years. He has a long history of smoking which sums up to 40 pack years but he quit a decade ago. He also has documented high cholesterol levels managed with statins  along with a case of early-stage prostate cancer that was treated and has remained in remission for five years. His father passed away due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 76.   Presentation: Mr. Brown describes his symptoms as non-radiating dull ache in the center of his abdomen  sometimes extending to his back. He associates this discomfort with eating  initially dismissing it as gastric problems. He denies any recent weight loss  loss of appetite  changes in bowel or bladder movement patterns  chest pain  or any other discomfort in his extremities.   On general examination  he is 5’10'' tall  weighs approximately 195 lbs  and has a BMI of 28. On abdominal palpation  a pulsatile mass is identified in the peri-umbilical area which is indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His blood pressure is slightly elevated at 150/95  but he has clear lungs and a regular heart rate.  Given Mr. Brown’s age  sex  history of hypertension  positive family history  and smoking history  he fits demographically with the typical abdominal aortic aneurysm patient as seen in the literature. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common amongst males aged 65 to 75  with these risk factors.   Imaging Studies/Clinical Findings: An immediate abdominal ultrasound was scheduled  given the physical finding of a pulsatile mass  and the high suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Results confirmed the presence of an aneurysm  and further imaging with CT angiography showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm in its largest diameter.  In Summary: This case presentation features Mr. John Brown  a 72-year-old Caucasian male who fits the demographic common to abdominal aortic aneurysm as noted in the majority of medical literature and presents with related signs and symptoms. Further imaging studies confirmed these suspicions.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,51,Patient Presentation:  We present Mr. Johnson  a 73-year-old Caucasian male  who has presented with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is a former smoker with a history of smoking two packs a day for 40 years  who quit 10 years ago. He has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease.  He came in complaining of sudden severe lower back pain of 7/10 intensity. He also reported shortness of breath  light-headedness  and abdominal discomfort. He lives independently. He has an active lifestyle and reports no issues with daily activities. However  he noted feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen which he had ignored until the back pain began today.  His family history includes a father who had an AAA that was repaired surgically  and a mother who died from stroke. He has two older brothers – both with a history of cardiovascular disease.  Mr. Johnson is retired and enjoys gardening  reading  and fishing in his leisure time. He lives with his wife  and he consumes alcohol moderately - about 2-3 drinks per week. His diet includes red meat  fried foods  and minimal vegetables.  His presenting symptoms alongside his history of smoking and family history of AAA point toward a possible diagnosis of AAA. Research has shown that factors such as age  smoking history  high blood pressure  and family history of AAA contribute to the incidence of AAA  and that it is more common among men and Caucasian individuals.  Further tests  including an abdominal ultrasound  will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and establish the size of the aneurysm. If confirmed  treatment options will be discussed  depending on the size and stability of the aneurysm.  Ref: Howard DP  Banerjee A  Fairhead JF  et al.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,52,Presentation Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Slide 1:  Introduction  Good morning/afternoon  Our patient today is a 72-year-old Caucasian male - a demographic that statistically and substantially associates with a higher likelihood of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms.   Slide 2: Patient Demographic Information   Our patient hails from an urban residence and is a retired car mechanic by profession  hence with a possibility of exposure to environmental stressors. His BMI falls into the category of overweight  classified at 29  with a height of 5 feet 10 inches and weight of 200 pounds – an additional risk factor for aortic disease. He is an ex-smoker with a 30-pack year history  a known modifiable risk factor that increases the probability of developing aneurysms.  Slide 3:  Past Medical History   The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  which is managed with calcium channel blockers  thereby signifying another risk factor contributing to the disease state. He also has a known history of peripheral artery disease  which is an associated comorbidity of this condition. Previous medical records also indicate a familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysms  as his father passed away from a ruptured aneurysm at the age of 76  stressing genetics' role.  Slide 4: Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of recognizing our patient's specific demographic as a potential high-risk group for abdominal aortic aneurysm  given the confluence of age  race  familial history  and predisposing medical conditions.   Thank you for your attention  and I am ready to field questions now.   Slide 5:  Questions?  Please feel free to ask any queries or provide comments about the presentation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,53,Title: Clinical Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction  Today's case involves a patient presenting with a condition known as Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). An AAA is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta that exceeds the normal diameter by more than 50 percent  and is a creating cause of death due to aortic rupture.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  reflecting demographic data that suggests Caucasian males over the age of 65 have a higher prevalence of AAA. He is a retired construction worker and currently lives alone. He has been a smoker for over 50 years  a habit that significantly increases the risk of AAA.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Smith has a relevant medical history for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing with medication. He also underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years ago. His father passed away due to a ruptured aneurysm  indicating a possible genetic predisposition for aneurysm development.  Slide 4: Current Symptoms  Mr. Smith presents with abdominal and lower back pain that he has been experiencing for the past week. He describes it as a pulsating feeling near his navel  consistent with AAA symptoms. However  he has had no recent weight loss  changes in appetite or gastrointestinal symptoms.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  A physical examination revealed an abdominal mass that pulsated with heartbeats. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta exceeding 3.4cm  classifying it as an AAA. No signs of rupture were detected.  Slide 6: Conclusion  In the case of Mr. Smith  the demographic profile  personal and family medical history  presenting symptoms  and diagnostic findings all lead to a diagnosis of AAA. Prompt surgical intervention as the appropriate treatment option will be planned  alongside lifestyle modification advice particularly for smoking cessation. Regular check-ups and monitoring will be essential to ensure optimal post-surgical recovery and prevent possible complications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,54,Slide 1: Introduction  Welcome to today's presentation where we will discuss a clinical case of an individual with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Slide 2: Demographic Information  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male from rural Kansas. He is retired and lives with his wife of 45 years. He has a history of smoking two packs a day since his late teens  though he quit five years ago.   Slide 3: Medical History  The patient’s medical history shows that he has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol levels which have been managed with medication. He also has a 10-year history of stable ischemic heart disease. There is no known family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.   Slide 4: Previous Symptoms  Over the past few months  the patient began experiencing intermittent  yet progressive  abdominal and back pain. He initially attributed this to ageing or potentially an old hernia acting up.   Slide 5: Recent Symptoms  Recently  the intensity and frequency of the pain significantly increased  causing him to seek medical attention. He also noticed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  along with some unintentional weight loss.  Slide 6: Literature Review  Literature shows that males older than 65 years of age  particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity and with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  or heart disease  are at a higher risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Slide 7: Conclusion  In conclusion  this patient’s demographic profile  medical history  and presenting symptoms indicate a high suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the risk factors  early signs  and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  as timely detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes.   Slide 8: Next Steps  The next step involves diagnostic imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size and extent of the aneurysm. Following which  the course of action will be decided  depending on whether the aneurysm is small and slow-growing  or large and at risk of rupture. Treatment options may range from regular monitoring to surgery.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,55,Title: Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: We are presenting the case of Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  who came in for a routine medical check-up in our outpatient clinic. He's a former smoker with a history of smoking for about 30 years  a habit he has quit for about 15 years. Mr. Smith's family history is notable for cardiovascular disease – his father died from a myocardial infarction in his late sixties.  Past Medical History: On the review of his past medical history  Mr. Smith has a documented diagnosis of hypertension  which has been managed for the past 15 years with a daily dose of Ramipril. Furthermore  he has been treated for hypercholesterolemia with Atorvastatin for the past 10 years. Smith is also diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and is on Tiotropium inhaler as required.   Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith has not reported any significant abdominal pain or back pain recently. However  a routine physical exam revealed a pulsating mass in his abdomen. An Ultrasound was requested which revealed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring around 5.5 cm. He has no history of syncope or lower limb claudication.  In conclusion: Mr. Smith's age  gender  smoking habit  and high blood pressure  coupled with his family's medical history  certainly increase his risk of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Despite being asymptomatic  the size of the aneurysm warrants immediate intervention to prevent serious complications such as rupture  leading to severe internal bleeding  a significant cause of mortality in such patients. Hence  he was referred to a vascular surgeon for further management of his AAA.  Note: According to the literature  AAA is more common in Caucasian males aged over 65 and is associated with modifiable risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. Family history of cardiovascular disease also increases the risk of AAA significantly. Therefore  Mr. Smith's case represents an accurate demographic representation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,56,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Patient Introduction   Mr. James Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a complaint of intermittent abdominal and back pain for the past two months. He is a longtime resident of a small community town in North Carolina  where he lives with his wife and is retired from a career in construction.   Slide 2: Previous Medical History   Mr. Smith has a history of smoking  having smoked one pack a day for the past 50 years. He also exhibits other cardiovascular risk factors  including hypertension  which has been controlled with medication for the last 10 years. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago but is non-compliant with his prescribed statin. There have been no significant surgeries in his medical history  and he does not have any known allergies.  Slide 3: Family Medical History   In his family more specifically  his father died of a massive stroke at the age of 75. And one of his two older brothers underwent a surgical procedure to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 72.   Slide 4: Current Presentation  Today  Mr. Smith describes sudden  intense abdominal and lower back pain that he rates as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain is not relieved by changes in position or over the counter pain medication. His wife also reports that he appears paler than usual and seems to fatigue easily.   Slide 5: Suspected Diagnosis and Reasoning  Given Mr. Smith's age  gender  and significant smoking history  as well as the familial occurrence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  we are concerned that his current symptoms may be indicative of an impending aortic rupture. A differential diagnosis will also consider gastrointestinal conditions such as diverticulitis or pancreatitis  but his familial history and symptomatology lean heavily towards an aortic aneurysm.  End of Slide.  (Note: Remember that an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency and requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. The patient's history and characteristics in this presentation are consistent with the most common demographic group - older male smokers with a family history of the condition.)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,57,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Introduction: Today we will discuss the case of a male patient currently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Patient Demographics: Patient 'X' is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a height of 5'10"""" and a weight of approximately 220 lbs  living in a suburban neighborhood. He is a former smoker  having quit around ten years ago  but had a significant smoking history before then. He consumes alcohol in moderation.  Relevant Medical History: He has a significant past medical history  which includes: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed around 15 years ago  under management with antihypertensive medication. 2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Likely linked to his long history of smoking. 3. Hyperlipidemia: He has elevated serum cholesterol levels  controlled through both diet and statins. 4. He underwent an appendectomy at age 44.  Present Symptoms: He came to the hospital complaining of mild to moderate abdominal pain  lasting a few days  constant but worsening recently. The pain is in the lower abdomen  primarily central  but radiates to the back in the form of a vague discomfort. He denies any fever  nausea  or recent changes in bowel or bladder habits. He mentions intermittent episodes of claudication.  Examination and Diagnosis: Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. The patient's blood pressure was slightly elevated. Given the history and examination  an immediate vascular surgery consult was sought and an abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which confirmed the presence of an AAA. CT angiography was subsequently recommended for better size assessment and planning possible repair.  Conclusion: Current management includes frequent monitoring  lifestyle alterations  medical control of comorbid conditions and assessing possible surgical intervention. Prompt identification and timely intervention are essential to prevent rupture  which has a high mortality rate.  References: The above presentation accurately represents the demographics commonly associated with AAA. According to the literature  AAAs are more common in males  significantly in older Caucasian males. Smoking  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and COPD are also well-established risk factors for AAA (Sakalihasan et al.  2018)."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,58,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Patient Case Presentation   PATIENT OVERVIEW   Mr. Robert Anderson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented with intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort for around six weeks. His symptoms include pain in the lower back and abdominal fullness  especially after meals. Mr. Anderson is a retired engineer  a lifelong smoker with a 45-pack-year history  and has a recorded BMI of 28.6. He has not been compliant with medical check-ups for the past 8 years.   DEMOGRAPHICS   Studies denote that the demographic most prone to abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) include Caucasian men over the age of 65. Factors enhancing the risk of AAAs involve family history of the disease  smoking  and high blood pressure. Incidentally  these demographics and risk factors align with our patient's profile.  MEDICAL HISTORY   Mr. Anderson was diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago. He has a history of hyperlipidemia for which he was prescribed statins. Mr. Anderson also reports his father died due to an aneurysm rupture  however  isn't sure of the location of the aneurysm. Despite his ailments  he has been rather noncompliant with the prescribed antihypertensive medications. The patient has no history of diabetes  cancer  or major surgeries.   PRESENT CONDITION   According to initial diagnostics such as a physical examination and ultrasound  there is a palpable and pulsating mass in his abdominal area  suggesting a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. Immediate further investigations like Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) have been suggested to confirm the diagnosis as well as the severity of the aneurysm.   CONCLUSION   To summarize  Mr. Anderson's case exemplifies a high-risk patient for abdominal aortic aneurysms  given his advanced age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of aneurysms. It underscores the need for rigorous preventive and screening strategies in individuals with such risk factors  in order to ensure early detection and management of AAAs.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,59,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient's Information: The patient  Mr. Smith  is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  living in a rural setting in the mid-western United States. He is a retired automobile mechanic and lives with his wife in a small town. He is an active smoker for the past 40 years with a significant pack-year history. He also has a personal history of excessive alcohol ingestion for the past 20 years.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed with anti-hypertensive medication and statins  respectively  for the past 15 years. Last year  he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation due to severe coronary artery disease. Mr. Smith's paternal history is significant for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Symptoms: He has been complaining of constant  severe pain in his lower back  going to the chest and abdominal region. He also reported feeling a palpable pulsating mass on his lower abdomen. However  he has no reported symptoms of fever  weight loss  or loss of appetite  and there was no recent trauma reported.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated in the periumbilical region. There is no noted tenderness to the surrounding areas. His blood pressure was slightly elevated on presentation  which may indicate hypertension.  Possible Diagnosis: Considering his age  chronic smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of AAA  the presenting symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Next Steps: He needs immediate evaluation  including imaging studies like ultrasound or CT angiography  to assess the size and location of the aneurysm  risk of rupture  and need for surgical intervention. He needs to be advised to stop smoking immediately  manage his hypertension  and reduce alcohol consumption to mitigate the risk factors tied to AAA prognosis.   This is a representation of an average patient who might present with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  based on predominance in elderly males  Caucasians  smokers  and people with history of heart diseases as found in the literature.  [Please note: This is not a real patient. It is a representation based on the common demographic and medical history of patients who present with abdominal aortic aneurysm.]
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,60,"Title: A Clinical Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile  Name: Mr. David Layman Age: 74 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Factory Worker  Residence: Wichita  Kansas  Chief Complaint: Patient reports experiencing an intense and constant pain in his abdominal and lower back region for the last three days. He describes the pain as a """"deep gnawing sensation"""" mostly localized to the middle of his abdomen.  Medical History: Mr. Layman has a significant history of peripheral arterial disease and high blood pressure. He is a former smoker  having quit the habit thirty years ago  after over twenty years of heavy smoking. He is also overweight with a BMI of 29. His diet is poor  high in processed foods and low in fruits and vegetables. He has had an irregular exercise habit  with long periods of sedentarism.   Family History:  Mr. Layman's father passed away at 62 due to a heart attack. His mother lived to 91 and had hypertension and osteoarthritis. He has two brothers  one of whom has a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.   Social History: Mr. Layman is a widower with three grown children. He lives alone and enjoys reading and watching television. He has a history of heavy alcohol consumption but has reduced his intake in recent years. He has declined overall since his wife's death five years ago.  Discussion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a condition that predominantly affects older males  especially those aged 65-75 years. Caucasians are reported to have a higher incidence than other races. Risk factors pertinent to Mr. Layman's case include his age  male sex  history of peripheral arterial disease  hypertension  smoking history  and family history of cardiovascular disease. It is worth noting that AAAs often remain silent until rupture  at which point they become a life-threatening emergency. Therefore  it's crucial to perform diagnostic tests  like ultrasound  once the suspicion is raised  for timely intervention.  This case presentation aligns with demographic data for AAA  as referenced in literature. Proactive treatment and lifestyle modifications can be lifesaving  emphasizing the role of primary health care providers in recognizing these risk factors early."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,61,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Elderly Male Patient   Patient Presentation: Mr. Richardson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents to our clinic today with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort for the past few weeks. The pain is not associated with his meals  bowel movements  or physical activities. He noted unintentional weight loss of 5 lbs in the last month. He denies fever  night sweats  or changes in bowel habits. His appetite has remained good.   Demographic Details:  Mr. Richardson hails from a suburban neighborhood  has a college education  and worked as a civil engineer before retirement. He is a non-smoker but admits to social drinking. He lives with his wife and has a strong social support network.   Past Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension for which he has been on Atenolol for the last ten years. He has been relatively compliant with his medications. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago which is managed with dietary modifications. He has no known drug allergies. He underwent appendectomy during his young adult years and has not had any significant illnesses since. His family history is pertinent for cardiovascular disease  with his father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 67.   Based on Mr. Richardson’s demographic profile  he corresponds to the typical patient diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA predominantly affects older males  particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity. Risk factors include a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a family history of cardiovascular disease  some of which Mr. Richardson possesses. The subtle  nonspecific nature of his presenting symptoms also indicates a potential AAA. Further investigation is warranted by complete physical examination and potentially an ultrasound or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.   In conclusion  Mr. Richardson's demographic details  past medical history  and presenting symptoms align with characteristics commonly observed in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. We plan to conduct further diagnostic testing  while also educating him about the signs  symptoms  and risks associated with AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,62,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Male  Slide 1: Patient Introduction  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with abdominal pain and back pain that has been persistent for a week. He noticed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen and described the pain as entirely unusual to the minor discomforts he has experienced in the past.   Slide 2: Demographic Information and Prevalence  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are relatively common and can be life-threatening. They mostly occur in men over 65 years  with an estimated prevalence of 1.3% in men aged 45-54 years  jumping to 12.5% in those aged 75-84. They are more common in Caucasians while less common in Hispanic  African American  and Asian populations.   Slide 3: Medical History The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years  a significant risk factor for AAA. He has a past medical history of high blood pressure  hypercholesterolemia  and peripheral vascular disease  all of which exacerbate his risk. His father died from a ruptured AAA  indicating the patient's increased hereditary risk.   Slide 4: Current Medication The patient is currently on antihypertensives  a statin for cholesterol control  and aspirin for its antiplatelet effect. He is adherent with his medications and understands the necessity to manage his health conditions.   Slide 5: Pain Characteristic and Physical Examination The patient reports experiencing a sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen. He has not felt any relief  regardless of his position or movement. Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is palpable  and a bruit is heard through auscultation in the abdominal area.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Procedures Given the patient's presenting symptoms  past history  family history  and physical exam findings  an abdominal ultrasound is the immediate assessment for further evaluation on the suspicion of an AAA.  Slide 7: Management and Treatment The management will depend upon the size and growth rate of this AAA  as determined by ultrasound results. Small AAAs (less than 5.5 cm in men) are usually managed conservatively with surveillance and control of cardiovascular risk factors  such as smoking cessation and managing hypertension and cholesterol. However  larger AAAs or rapidly expanding those require surgical intervention.   Slide 8: Summary This presentation outlined the case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Given his age  sex  family history  smoking habits  and medical history of high blood pressure  hypercholesterolemia  and peripheral vascular disease  this case is a representative example of an AAA patient to validate the need for a thorough evaluation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,63,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction Mr. John Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the Emergency Department at our hospital with complaints of severe  abrupt mid-abdominal pain.   Slide 2: Demographics As per literature  the demographic most affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are males over the age of 65  especially those of Caucasian descent.  Slide 3: Medical History The patient is a two packs per day smoker with a 50 year history  has moderate alcohol use  and a well-documented past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had myocardial infarction 10 years ago and was treated successfully with a stent placement. Therefore  it depicts his risk factors associated with AAA  including long-term tobacco use  atherosclerosis  and advanced age.  Slide 4: Symptoms  Mr. Smith reported experiencing a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain that began approximately 3 hours prior to presentation. He stated the pain felt like a ripping sensation and was constant. He also felt some back pain  which he never had before.  Slide 5: Clinical findings and Diagnosis  On physical examination  his pulse was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 150/95 mmHg  and an apparent non-tender abdominal mass. Further investigations (CT angiography) confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal AAA with evidence of rupture.   Slide 6: Treatment  The patient was immediately recommended for emergency endovascular aneurysm repair given his high risk for rupture and subsequent mortality. His postoperatory period was uneventful and was discharged after a week.  In this case  it is crucial to note that AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture  which emphasizes the importance of routine screening in older males with a history of smoking or atherosclerosis.   In conclusion  Mr. Smith's case is representative of a typical AAA patient  including age  gender  genetic risk factors  and lifestyle choices such as smoking and moderate alcohol use.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,64,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Our patient is Mr. James Anderson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired police officer  presenting with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Mr. Anderson is a non-Hispanic  hailing from an urban setting  living with his wife of 40 years. James has a history of smoking  reporting a 30-pack year history  but successfully quit 10 years ago. He moderately consumes alcohol  with an intake of 2-3 standard drinks per week.   In terms of his medical history  Mr. Anderson has hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease. Mr. Anderson was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 15 years ago and has been managing both conditions with medications. The peripheral artery disease was diagnosed five years ago  following changes in his exercise tolerance and walking distance. This patient presents an increased risk given these conditions  all of which could contribute to his current presentation of AAA.   He has  as well  a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father suffering a myocardial infarction at the age of 75  and his older brother also has an AAA.   Mr. Anderson does not have diabetes and has no known history of COPD or asthma.    His AAA was detected during a routine ultrasound screening; the aneurysm currently measures around 5.4 cm in size. Mr. Anderson has reported no symptoms related to the aneurysm  such as abdominal or back pain.  In terms of his psychosocial history  Mr. Anderson has been in a monogamous relationship for years and does not report any use of illicit drugs or practices of high-risk behaviors. He is currently under moderate stress due to his recent diagnosis.   This is a clear clinical presentation of an older adult man  representative of the typical demographic most commonly affected by AAA: older  male  with a past history of smoking  and pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The literature consistently indicates these factors significantly contribute to the development and progression of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,65,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Patient's Case Presentation   Introduction:  Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to be more prevalent amongst Caucasian men over the age of 60  aligning with Mr. Johnson's demographics.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a significant medical history that corresponds to the major risk factors associated with AAA. He was a long term smoker  having recently quit five years ago but he smoked a pack a day for nearly 50 years before that. He has a history of hypertension for which he takes Losartan 50 mg daily. His other relevant history includes high cholesterol  treated with Atorvastatin 20 mg  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and elder brother having experienced myocardial infarctions. Mr. Johnson also had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about 10 years ago  managed successfully with warfarin therapy.  Presenting Complaints: The presentation of an AAA can often be asymptomatic until rupture  making early detection conditions critical. Our patient reported mild to moderate abdominal and lower back pain consistent with AAA. He mentioned it felt different from his occasional flare-ups of chronic back pain. He also reported experiencing some episodes of brief dizziness over the past month.   Summary: In conclusion  Mr. Johnson is in the major risk demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysms  being a senior  Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  smoking  and familial predisposition. His presenting symptoms and history point towards AAA. Early detection and intervention are vital for such patients to avoid the catastrophic consequences of aortic rupture. The patient has been recommended for further diagnostic investigations and specialist referral.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,66,Title: Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith. He is retired military living in suburban Pennsylvania with his wife. He has been a smoker for more than 50 years and consumes alcohol moderately.  Medical Background: Mr. Smith has a medical history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  both chronic conditions commonly associated with the development of AAA. He had been prescribed antihypertensive medications and inhalers for the COPD  but his compliance with these therapies has been moderate at best. He does not report any family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysms.  Present Complaint: Mr. Smith came for a scheduled regular checkup. While he does not have any persistent symptoms  he reports occasional mild abdominal and lower back pain  which he attributed to old age and physical strain. No weight loss  decreased appetite  or bowel irregularity reported.  Clinician’s Observations: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was felt  which is a classic sign of AAA. Preliminary labs were carried out  and the patient’s blood pressure was found slightly elevated (150/90 mmHg). His BMI is 28.3 kg/m2  indicating overweight status which also increases the risk.  Diagnostic Procedure: Given the patient's age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  COPD  the presence of a suspicious pulsating mass in the abdomen  and a relevant risk factor BMI  a decision was made to further investigate the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with an abdominal ultrasound.  Discussion: AAA is more common in males  especially in their eighth (70-79 years old) decade of life  and Caucasian ethnicity. Risk factors to include tobacco use history  family history of AAA  COPD  and hypertension. Early detection leads to proper management hence prevention of fatal rupture.   Informed Consent: Mr. Smith was informed about the necessity of an ultrasound  and in case of confirmation  potential interventions ranging from careful monitoring to endovascular/surgical repair. As a retired military personnel  he understands the risks involved and agrees to proceed with further investigations.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,67,Title: Case Presentation: An Elderly Male Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Introduction: The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian male who presented with generalized abdominal pain  primarily located in the middle of the abdomen. The pain can be characterized as dull  continuous  and has been unrelieved in the past four days. He further reports that the pain seems to radiate to his lower back and is not associated with meals or bowel movements. According to the literature  AAA typically affects males over the age of 65 who have a history of smoking  which aligns with our patient's demographic.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a history of long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease seven years ago. He has successfully undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also has Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)  and underwent surgery for a similar aneurysm in his popliteal artery two years ago.   The patient is a long-term smoker and has consumed approximately 30 pack-years of cigarettes. Studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between heavy smoking and AAA. In August of 2015  his cardiologist had diagnosed him with a small infra-renal AAA measuring 3.0 cm in diameter discovered during a routine imaging study  which has been under surveillance.    Physical Examination: He appeared to be in discomfort and periods of restlessness. Blood pressure was 178/80 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 bpm. Examination of the abdomen revealed a palpable pulsatile mass in the epigastric region without overlying skin changes  bruit  or indications of inflammation. Additionally  there were no signs of peripheral vascular system abnormalities or other significant findings.   Conclusion: Given the patient’s advancing age  history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  and known diagnosis of infra-renal AAA  there is a high possibility that this increase in symptoms may be due to the progression of his AAA. Urgent imaging will be prioritized to assess the size and extent of the present AAA. Depending on the size of the aneurysm and the state of the patient  repair of the aneurysm would be considered promptly to prevent catastrophic consequences of rupture. It's critical to note that the most significant risk factors for AAA include age  male sex  smoking  and atherosclerosis  all of which coincide with the patient's health history. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,68,Presentation:   Patient's Details:  Mr. Garcia  a 75-year-old Hispanic male  presents with complaints of persistent abdominal pain and discomfort. He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack year smoking history. He retired from a desk job 10 years ago and lives with his wife.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Garcia reports experiencing abdominal pain and discomfort  describing it as a deep  gnawing pain  which has been gradually increasing over the past several weeks. He had this on and off in the past but the severity and persistence caught his attention recently. He has tried OTC pain medications with slight relief.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia about 10 years ago for which he takes medication regularly. He has been a chronic heavy smoker for more than 50 years but has quit smoking a year ago. He underwent coronary angioplasty 8 years ago. There is no history of diabetes or renal disease. His surgical history is unremarkable.  Family History: There is a positive family history of cardiovascular disorders: his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and a brother who had a stroke at age 62.  Background: He worked as an accountant and carried out a relatively sedentary lifestyle. His diet was rich in saturated fats but has modified to a healthier one over the past decade due to his heart condition. He is married with three adult children and lives with his wife in suburban Chicago.  Explanation: This presentation reflects the demographic representation for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) as found in the literature. Men  particularly those over age 65  are significantly more likely to develop AAAs  as are smokers. High blood pressure  heart disease  and hyperlipidemia are identified as risk factors. The disease shows a racial bias  with reduced rates seen in Hispanic  African American and Asian populations compared to Caucasians. However  smoking  known to be a strong risk factor  levels the field leading to similar risks for Hispanics  overcoming the protective genetic factor.  This case attempts to demonstrate a typical example based on epidemiological studies  though it's important to bear in mind AAA can affect anyone  and presenting symptoms may vary. The chosen racial background  age  medical history  and lifestyle habits are in line with principal demographic information and disease occurrence frequency.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,69,Title: Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Introduction:  Today we'll be discussing a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. The patient presents regularly for follow-ups  and on the last visit  severe abdominal pain paired with back pain and tenderness was observed.  Demographic Information: The patient is a retired engineer and a lifelong resident of Oklahoma  USA. He lives independently with his wife and reports that he continues to engage in social activities. He is a former smoker  who smoked a pack a day for approximately 50 years recollecting to have stopped smoking around his 62nd birthday. He is a social drinker and denies any illicit drug usage.   Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 55  and has been on a regular treatment regimen of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. 2. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed at age 58  and has been on statin therapy since. 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed at age 60  well-controlled with oral hypoglycemics.  Family History:  The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having passed away at the age of 70 of a myocardial infarction and a paternal uncle who had an aneurysm (unknown location).  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appears in apparent distress due to abdominal and back pain. There's noted abdominal tenderness with an evident pulsatile mass in the central abdomen upon palpation. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 156/90 mmHg.  Presentation Synopsis:  The patient's age  sex  longstanding hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking history  and positive family history put him at a significantly higher risk for AAA. Further investigations including abdominal ultrasonography or CT Aortogram will be needed to confirm the AAA  its size  location  and the need for intervention.  This case represents the typical demographic found in literature  as AAAs are seen more commonly in males  Caucasians  smokers  and individuals with a family history of aneurysm or cardiovascular disease. This condition is seen typically in the age group of 65-75 years old.  Importantly  this patient’s AAA symtoms  including the severe abdominal and back pain  may suggest rupture  which would warrant immediate medical attention. Our discussion to follow will plan out possible diagnostic and treatment pathways for this patient.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,70,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: Mr. James Foster  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  presents with what he describes as a """"deep  gnawing pain"""" in his lower abdomen and back. Mr. Foster is a retired construction worker and mentions being a smoker for 45 years.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Foster reports the pain started about a week ago  subtly  but has gradually become persistent. At first  he ascribed the discomfort to old age or possible gastric issues. However  the abrupt increase in its severity compelled him to seek medical attention. The pain isn't worsened or alleviated by food intake  posture  or using analgesics.   Past Medical History: Mr. Foster has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed on Lisinopril and Simvastatin  respectively. He has been adherent to the medications and maintains follow-ups with his primary healthcare physician. He was diagnosed with mild COPD approximately three years ago  secondary to his long history of smoking.   Family History: Mr. Foster’s father suffered from cardiovascular disease  dying from a heart attack in his late sixties  suggesting potential genetic predisposition to vascular diseases. No other significant family history was mentioned.  Social History: Mr. Foster lives with his wife in their suburban home. He quit smoking five years ago but admits a 45-year history of tobacco use. He drinks alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use.   Investigations & Diagnosis: Given the nature of his pain  patient’s advanced age  male sex  history of smoking  and having vascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected. Physical examination demonstrated abdominal tenderness and a pulsatile abdominal mass. An urgent abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a 5.5cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm in diameter. This diagnosis of AAA is consistent with literature indicating this condition is most prevalent in older Caucasian males with a history of smoking and other vascular risk factors.  Management: He was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation for potential intervention  considering his symptoms and aneurysm size exceeding 5 cm. His primary care doctor was notified  and arrangements have been made for follow-up and further management.  Sources:   Upchurch  G. R.  Jr  & Schaub  T. A. (2006). Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,71,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Case  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient Profile: - Mr. Davis  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer - Known smoker for 45 years  attempted to quit multiple times but unsuccessful - Suffers from moderate obesity – Current BMI stands at 30.5 - Family history significant for cardiovascular mortality (Father died at age 62 from a heart attack  mother suffered a stroke at age 70) - Is a moderate alcohol drinker  - Lives a sedentary lifestyle   Slide 2: Medical History   - Hypertensive for 15 years  currently on Lisinopril  - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  on Metformin - Diagnosed and treated for high cholesterol  currently on Atorvastatin - Regular checkups indicated steadily progressive peripheral artery disease over the past 8 years  asymptomatic so far - Had a bout of transient ischemic attack 5 years ago  subsequently put on low-dose Aspirin regimen   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms   - Leaking Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm suspected - Complains of continuous and severe abdominal and back pain  described as a dull throbbing sensation – pain score 8/10 - Reports that he often feels lightheaded and experienced fainting attack once recently - Loss of appetite and constipation noticed  Slide 4: Risk Factors   Consistent with the demographic data: - Age: Most AAAs occur in patients aged 65 and older - Sex: Males are 4-5 times more likely to develop an AAA - Smoking: A significant risk factor contributing to AAA development and growth - Upstream Diseases: Hypertension  Peripheral Artery Disease  and Atherosclerosis - Family History: Increase in the risk due to genetics   Slide 5: Conclusion   Mr. Davis has multiple risk factors making him a candidate for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). His symptoms  along with his medical history  point towards a leaking AAA that may require immediate attention to prevent rupture. It would be prudent to assess further using diagnostic tools like an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiogram to confirm diagnosis and plan for the necessary intervention.   Note: Confidentiality maintained by altering the name while presenting the case. It's essential to approach each patient with respect and provide the necessary care and support.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,72,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. J.C.  presents today with significant abdominal pain  predominantly in the lower regions  which he describes as a pulsating feeling """"like a heartbeat"""" in his abdomen. The patient is a former smoker  having quit the habit about seven years ago after a four-decade long history of smoking.  Background: Mr. J.C. has a past medical history including hypertension  high cholesterol  and heart disease  specifically coronary artery disease  for which he underwent angioplasty five years ago. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease three years ago  a condition that has been controlled with medical management. He has been adherent to his medications and follows up regularly with his cardiologist. He lives independently at home with his wife and maintains an active lifestyle. He does not have any genetic disorders  nor any familial history of the aortic aneurysm. He is not a diabetic nor has he ever been diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder.   Medical Assessment and Plan:  Given his presenting symptoms and significant cardiovascular history  the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a substantial cause for concern. Mr. J.C.'s age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease are known risk factors for AAA  as documented in the literature.   To evaluate this prospect further  a physical examination involving a detailed cardiovascular and abdominal exam along with diagnostic studies  specifically an abdominal ultrasound  are recommended. Should an AAA be confirmed  the size will necessitate an immediate response. Small aneurysms may benefit from monitoring through medical management and lifestyle modifications  while larger or growing aneurysms may warrant surgical intervention. Further consultation with a vascular surgeon will be advised accordingly.   In summary  Mr. J.C.’s presentation and history reveal several risk factors for AAA. Further evaluation will help to confirm this diagnosis. His case emphasizes the importance of regular health surveillance in those with multiple risk factors for AAA to allow early identification and optimization of care.  References: 1.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,73,"Slide 1: Introduction Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 2: Demographics  Today’s case involves a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient. The choice of this particular demographic is based on the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)  which are most commonly found among older males and individuals of European descent.  Slide 3: Patient History Our patient  Mr. Thomas  is a retired construction worker who has a 45-year history of smoking  with a cessation 6 years ago. He presents with occasional abdominal and lower back pain  which is common in the setting of an AAA. He is also overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 31  and has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia years ago. All of these factors together represent the strong lifestyle and genetic risks associated with the development of an AAA.  Slide 4: Further Background & Investigations Former investigations were carried out when Mr. Thomas felt a """"pulse-like"""" feeling in his stomach. Subsequent ultrasound images revealed an AAA of 5.3 cm  which had increased slightly from a 5.1 cm measurement a year ago.   Slide 5: Past Medical History Mr. Thomas's past medical history is significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  which are conditions that have been associated with AAA in several studies. He underwent a CABG procedure 10 years ago  indicating existing coronary artery disease.   Slide 6: Conclusion  Understanding our patient’s demographic information and past medical history  we can offer appropriate intervention including closer monitoring or surgical consultations. AAA can be effectively managed when such risks are identified and properly addressed."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,74,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Profile: Patient Name: Mr. X  Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Race/ Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired   Presenting Complaint: Mr. X  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints of constant  intense pain in his lower back and abdominal region extending down to his pelvis.   Past Medical History: Mr. X has a history of hypertension and atherosclerosis. He has been a lifelong smoker  although he reduced the frequency to just a few cigarettes per day after his diagnosis of hypertension 10 years ago. He has no known allergies to medications. Mr. X's family history reveals that his father died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 78  and his elder brother had surgery for a similar condition when he was 67.   Current Medications:  Mr. X is currently on Lisinopril  a medication for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for the management of atherosclerosis. He also takes a daily aspirin as advised by his previous physician for coronary artery disease prevention.  Summary:  This case presentation highlights the typical demographic profile of a person diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which frequently occurs in Caucasian males above 65 years of age with a history of hypertension  atherosclerosis  smoking  and familial disposition. Key identifiers are severe pain in the lower back and abdominal area. The patient's past medical history and current medications illustrate the connection between cardiovascular disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms. His family history emphasizes the genetic component often seen in such cases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,75,Patient Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics: Mr. Joseph Johnson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  originally from Ohio  currently residing in Florida. He is a widower  living with his son's family. His lifetime occupation involved managing a construction business. Mr. Johnson was a heavy smoker but quit about ten years ago. However  he continues to consume alcohol moderately.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a multi-faceted medical history that includes controlled hypertension (on medication)  hyperlipidemia  and a previous cerebral sensorial episode about five years ago with no neurological sequelae. He has a reported history of 30-pack-years tobacco use. There are no known drug allergies. He is positive for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and signs of peripheral vascular disease  including intermittent claudication. Atherosclerosis  impacting the large and medium-sized arteries  was diagnosed earlier this year. His father passed away from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Current Presentation: Mr. Johnson was referred to the hospital by his primary care physician following a routine physical exam that raised suspicions of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He reports a vague discomfort in his abdominal region  which he initially attributed to excess gas or indigestion  since it did not affect his appetite or bowel movements. He also mentioned an occasional feeble pulse in his abdomen when he laid flat on his back. On investigation  the mentioned discomfort was placed just above the umbilicus  lateralized on his right side. Mr. Johnson denies any back pain  unexplained weight loss  fever  or any other urgent symptoms.   Medical literature reflects that abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in males over the age of 65  particularly  those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and a familial history of aneurysms  congruent with Mr. Johnson's demographics and history. Moreover  Caucasians are reported to have a higher risk of having AAA  thus making this a highly probable diagnosis. Most AAAs are asymptomatic and are often detected during routine physical exams  similar to the suspected case of the patient.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,76,Title: Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile:  Mr. Alex Kowalski is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who has been active and has lived a relatively healthy lifestyle until recently when he began experiencing moderate  persistent pain in his lower abdomen and lower back. Mr. Kowalski is a retired electrician currently residing in the suburbs of New York with his wife. He has a 30-year history of tobacco use but quit smoking five years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol intake  namely  a few bottles of beer each week.  Relevant Medical history:  Mr. Kowalski has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been managed well with medications. He also had a mild heart attack at the age of 67. He has Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been managed through oral hypoglycemic medications and lifestyle changes.  Presenting Symptoms:  He presents consistent  dull  and severe ache in his lower abdomen and lower back  which has persisted for the last two weeks. The pain does not radiate and is not relieved by change in position or over-the-counter pain killers. He also expresses feeling unusually tired but has not experienced any drastic weight changes  fever or night sweats. He denies recent trauma or heavy lifting.  Reason for Consultation:  These symptoms brought him to his primary care physician  who upon suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  referred him to our Cardiovascular department for further workup.   High-risk factors to consider for this patient:  Given Mr. Kowalski's age  gender  history of smoking  and existing comorbid conditions such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heart disease  he has several risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing an AAA.  Assessment Plan:  We plan to proceed with conducting an abdominal ultrasound  the primary diagnostic test for AAA. Depending on the results  a Computer Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be necessary for a more detailed assessment of the aorta.   If Mr. Kowalski is indeed found to have an AAA  we'll develop a management plan that may involve surveillance  medication adjustment  and potentially even surgery  depending upon the size and growth rate of the aneurysm and the overall assessment of Mr. Kowalski's health status.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,77,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Clinical Case Presentation   Patient Information:  Mr. J is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a week-long history of persistent lower back pain and occasional abdominal pain. The patient also reports feelings of lightheadedness and rapid heartbeat  especially after physical activities.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J is  a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 40-year habit  and has a history of hypertension  mildly elevated cholesterol levels  and had a myocardial infarction 7 years back. He currently controls his hypertension and cholesterol levels with medication.   Occupational History:  Mr. J is a retired civil engineer  and lives with his wife in a suburb. He has a history of moderate alcohol intake but denies use of any illicit drugs.  Family History:  His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Mr. J is unaware of any other vascular diseases within his close relatives.  Reason for Current Presentation:  The patient first noticed his back pain a week ago. He initially thought it was due to physical strain from gardening but the pain persisted despite rest and over the counter pain medications. On presentation  the pain is described as dull aching. The abdomen is mildly tender to touch with no pulsations felt upon palpation. The patient also reports unintentional weight loss over the past six months.  Epidemiology:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm predominantly affects older adults  especially males over the age of 65. Risk factors include tobacco use  hypertension  family history  and white ancestry  all of which Mr. J possesses.  With his persistent lower back and abdominal pain  unintentional weight loss  the patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with an unruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The family history of cardiovascular disease and his personal history of hypertension and former smoker status are also significant risk factors. We recommend further imaging studies to confirm the presence and extent of his potential abdominal aortic aneurysm. In case confirmed  a referral to a vascular surgeon for possible surgery shall be considered.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,78,Slide 1: Introduction  Today's case presentation is centered on a condition referred to as Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm denotes an enlarged area in the lower facet of the aorta  the leading bloodstream channel within the human system. AAAs pose a serious risk as they can lead to severe and lethal bleeding if ruptured.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics and History  Mr. James  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to our clinic with symptoms indicative of AAA  which include: pain in his abdomen and back  vomits  and dizziness. He is a lifelong smoker with a 50-pack-year history  and has a concomitant medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is socially active  consumes alcohol moderately  and has never been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders.  Slide 3: Statistical Overview  The demographics and health history align well with the literature on typical AAA patients. The prevalence of AAA varies across different areas but is particularly high amongst Caucasian males over the age of 65 years. Inferred from systematic review data  the age-standardized prevalence of AAA amongst men over 70 years old is approximately 3.9-7.2%. Known risk factors such as older age  male sex  and smoking are present.   Slide 4: Physical Examination and Investigations   On physical examination  a pulsating mass was felt in his abdomen. His blood pressure was elevated at 160/90  and his pulse was at 80/mi. A preliminary ultrasound confirmed a 5.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Slide 5: Discussion and Plan   Given the size of the AAA and the symptoms presented  surgery is strongly recommended for Mr. James  since the aneurysm is at an increased risk of rupturing. Furthermore  it is necessary to manage his hypertension and hyperlipidemia with appropriate medication adjustments to prevent any additional cardiovascular complications. His smoking habit is a major concern  which should be addressed through counseling and cessation support.   Mr. James represents a unique opportunity to understand AAA's real-world impact considering his presentation aligns very well with typical AAA demographics.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,79,Introduction: Today  we examine the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  who presents with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Demographics: Mr. X is in line with a typical AAA patient demographic: predominantly found in males and those over 65 years old  specifically White/Caucasian  which accounts for 80% of AAA cases in the United States. He is a retired engineer living with his wife of 40 years. He has a history of smoking for over 30 years before successfully quitting 15 years ago. His BMI is within an overweight range  which aligns with epidemiological studies showing a high prevalence of AAA in overweight individuals.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. X visited his primary care doctor reporting a persistent abdominal and lower back pain for two weeks. His pain level ranged from moderate to severe and was often unprovoked  becoming more intense after his evening meals.   Past Medical History: Mr. X’s past medical history is significant for high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels for the last ten years  both controlled with medication. His father also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm  revealing a crucial familial tendency.   Physical examination and relevant tests:  On physical examination  Mr. X’s blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/85 mmHg  despite regular use of antihypertensive medications. His abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid-epigastric region. An ensuing non-contrast CT scan confirmed an infrarenal AAA of about 5.5 cm diameter.  Conclusion: Mr. X's case bears classic AAA features including  being a former smoker  having a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and a familial history of AAA. As his aneurysm is over 5.5 cm  the risk of rupture is significant  necessitating immediate surgical evaluation and likely intervention.   This case underscores how essential early detection and monitoring of AAA is  especially in high-risk individuals like Mr. X  to prevent possible rupture and associated morbidity and mortality.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,80,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male by the name of Mr. Smith. He is a retired engineer with a long history of smoking and minimal physical activity. Mr. Smith has been residing with his wife in their suburban home in Houston  Texas.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has been managed for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 15 years  controlled through pharmacotherapy. He has also been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  primarily caused by his habit of smoking approximately 2 packs of cigarettes per day for 50 years. His other specific medical conditions include peripheral arterial disease and a history of coronary angioplasty performed 7 years ago due to coronary artery disease. No known drug allergies have been reported.  Clinical Presentation: Over the last three weeks  Mr. Smith started experiencing episodic abdominal pain  typically after meals  which he initially attributed to gastric discomfort. However  the frequency and intensity of the pain progressively escalated. He describes it as a sharp  gnawing sensation located in the mid-abdominal region that sometimes radiates to his lower back. This was often accompanied by a sense of fullness or bloating.  Last evening  he had an episode of acute severe abdominal and back pain that alarmed him  prompting his visit to our emergency department. Upon initial physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. His vitals at presentation were: Blood pressure – 155/95 mmHg; Heart rate – 90 beats/min; Respiratory rate – 18 breaths/min; Temperature – 98.4°F; Oxygen saturation – 94% on room air.   This clinical presentation and history suggest the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Urgent imaging studies were ordered to confirm this diagnosis and ascertain if a surgical intervention is necessary.  Demographic Representation: The patient's profile matches demographic characteristics typically associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. As per the literature  these are more frequently found in males  with increased incidence among the elderly  specifically those aged 65 to 75+. Smoking  hypertension  peripheral arterial disease  and atherosclerosis are known high-risk factors for the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Caucasians are also noted to have a significantly increased incidence than other racial groups. Mr. Smith's medical background and lifestyle align with these risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,81,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics: Mr. Jacobs is a 74-year-old Caucasian male  who is a retired military officer. He lives with his wife in the rural area of Arkansas and has two adult children living out of state. The relevance of his demographic information is based on the data from the literature which shows that Caucasian males  especially over the age of 65  show a higher prevalence of AAAs. Rural or semi-rural residents also have a higher incidence of AAA  likely due to access to healthcare.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jacobs has a significant past medical history. This includes a 45-year history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  as well as a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease ten years ago. All three conditions have well-established links to AAA  due to the strain they put on the vascular system.   He has a smoking history of 30 pack-years  and although he quit smoking ten years ago  his past smoking status is a key risk factor for AAA. He does not consume alcohol excessively and he follows a balanced diet.   There is also a relevant family history; his father had a AAA  which increases his own risk of having the disease.   Mr. Jacobs has been relatively physically active throughout his life  which may have conferred some level of protection against the development or progression of AAA.  Current Presentation and Clinical Findings: Mr. Jacobs presented to the emergency department complaining of a severe  sharp  and persistent pain in his lower back and abdominal area that came on suddenly. He also reported feeling light-headed and having cold  sweaty skin. On examination  there was a palpable pulsating mass in his abdomen  which raised the suspicion of a ruptured AAA.  In conclusion  Mr. Jacobs  as an elderly Caucasian male  with a history of smoking  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  peripheral arterial disease  and a familial history of AAA  falls within the high-risk group for AAA. His current symptoms and clinical findings strongly suggest a life-threatening condition  possibly a ruptured AAA that requires immediate medical attention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,82,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction:  Mr. X is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented with abdominal pain and back pain. These are the classic symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm but they only occur in around 50% of cases.   Demographics: Currently residing in Florida  Mr. X is retired and lives with his wife of 40 years. He is a former smoker having quit 15 years ago  but has a long history of smoking 2 packs a day for 30 years. He was regularly exposed to secondhand smoke during his youth and early adulthood. From the data available  men  especially those of Caucasian ethnicity  aged 65-75 years with a history of smoking are more likely to have abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Medical History: Mr. X has a rather significant past medical history that includes hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he takes prescribed medication. He also has been treated for peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease. He reports having had a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack) several years ago. He was also diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 10 years ago and has regular check-ups with a pulmonologist. He admits to his difficulty in maintaining a healthy eating and exercise regimen.  Recent Symptoms: Over the past week  he has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain and a throbbing sensation in the abdomen. Occasionally  he has reported low back pain concentrated in the lower lumbar region. He also mentions experiencing brief spells of faintness and dizziness.  Conclusion: Given his age  sex  race  family history  and lifestyle  Mr. X has multiple risk factors synonymous with the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aching  pulsation and tenderness he has been experiencing in his abdominal and lower back areas  coupled with spells of dizziness and faintness  indicates the need for immediate diagnosis and clinical intervention to prevent life-threatening conditions like rupture and hemorrhage.  Mr. X is demonstrating signs that warrant immediate attention and further diagnostic testing. Studies have shown that ruptured AAAs are often fatal  with about 80% not surviving until surgical repair  stressing the need for early diagnosis. It's crucial to push forth for an abdominal ultrasound  a non-invasive  accessible  and highly accurate test to detect an AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,83,Title: Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Name: Mr. John Smith  Age: 75 Years Old  Sex: Male   Race: Caucasian  I'd like to present our latest case  a 75-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith who came to our care complaining of severe abdominal and lower back pain  intermittent and unprompted in nature. This symptom suggests the possible presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker  has a 30-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and had a 40 pack-year smoking history  however  he quit smoking 10 years ago. His family history is significant with his father and grandfather both having died due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture in their late seventies.   He does not have diabetes and neither any history of cardiovascular diseases  but he has been clinically obese for over 20 years. Despite having peripheral arterial disease diagnosed 7 years ago  the patient has been consistent with his medications and follow-ups.  It's important to note that Mr. Smith fits the predominant demographic pattern for AAA  as major clinical studies show men  particularly those of Caucasian descent above 65  being disproportionately affected by AAA. Key risk factors  as found in literature  like age  male sex  smoking history  family history of AAA  and presence of other atherosclerotic diseases align pretty well with Mr. Smith's profile.   Whilst abdominal and back pain might possibly indicate signs of AAA rupture in his condition  it is noteworthy to mention AAA is often asymptomatic until it ruptures  making screening and early detection critically important in patients with high risk.  It is imperative that we conduct further tests to confirm the diagnosis such as abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  considering his history and current symptoms  to rule out any possibilities of an impending AAA rupture and manage it accordingly. Immediate intervention  either surgical or endovascular  will be particularly crucial if diagnostic procedures confirm a large  symptomatic AAA.   Mr. Smith's case presentation emphasizes the importance of recognizing AAA's associated risk factors and taking them into account in the early detection and management of this condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,84,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation  Patient's Details: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. J. He is a retired construction worker and has been a smoker for more than 50 years  currently consuming a pack of cigarettes per day. He has a previous medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and follows his medication regimen of statins and antihypertensive drugs diligently. On his paternal side  both his father and grandfather had aneurysms  which makes him genetically predisposed for the ailment.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. J visited the clinic complaining of persistent abdominal and lower back pain for the past two weeks which he says is not related to any injury. He also reported feeling unusually fatigued and experiencing slight weight loss without any significant change in his diet.  Examination Findings: The physical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the abdomen. More detailed investigations through ultrasound and CT scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm measures 5.3 cm in diameter  positioning it in the high-risk category warranting surgery.  Risk Factors: Mr. J’s risk factors for AAA include his age  male sex  genetic predisposition  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Caucasian ethnicity. As per the literature  Caucasians  especially those over 65 years of age  have a higher risk of AAA  and the male to female ratio is about 4:1. Smoking has been linked to about 75% of all cases of AAA.  Action Plan: Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptoms  the immediate recommendation is for him to undergo corrective surgery. Meanwhile  Mr. J has been advised to quit smoking and maintain his control over hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Discussion and Prognosis: With careful perioperative management  the prognosis after surgery is optimistic. Regular follow-ups and monitoring of his hypertension and cholesterol levels are crucial to the long-term success of the treatment and to prevent the recurrence of another AAA. Counseling to promote smoking cessation will also play a significant part in improving Mr. J's overall health status.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,85,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction  Patient: Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents with sharp  severe pain in his lower back and abdominal region  accompanied by light-headedness and nausea.  Slide 2: Past Medical History   Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker with a medical history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years. He has a history of hypertension  high cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis.   Slide 3: Demographics & Risk  Studies have shown that Caucasian males over 65 years  particularly those with a smoking history and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis  face a higher risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Slide 4: Presenting symptoms  Mr. Smith presents with symptoms typical of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  including severe pain in the abdomen or lower back that doesn't go away  feeling lightheaded  or nausea. These symptoms may indicate rupture of aneurysm which is a medical emergency and needs immediate attention.  Slide 5: Diagnosis   Preliminary physical examination showed a pulsating mass on palpation in the abdominal region. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter.  Slide 6: Treatment options & Management  The treatment options are based on the size of the aneurysm. Since Mr. Smith's aneurysm is considered large (5.5 cm)  surgical repair  either via an open procedure or less invasive endovascular approach  is likely the preferable treatment approach.  Slide 7: Conclusion   Prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is critical for emergency management and surgical intervention. In this case  Mr. Smith's risk factors (age  gender  race  smoking history  and cardiovascular diseases) should prompt healthcare providers to maintain a high level of suspicion for this potentially lethal condition. Regular screening and check-ups can help with early detection and management of this condition.   Slide 8: References  (List of references to support case study)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,86,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction:  Good morning/afternoon everyone  I would like to present a case on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA is a localized dilatation of the part of an aortic artery affecting the region below the kidneys. They usually occur silently  but when symptoms manifest or rupture occurs  it can lead to serious consequences.  Patient Information:  The patient is Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male residing in a suburban community. Literature indicates that AAA generally affects older men  particularly those of the white race  hence Mr. Smith's demographic is representative.  Presenting Complaint and History:  Mr. Smith was referred to our vascular clinic following an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm on an ultrasound scan which was carried out for his recurrent urinary tract infection. Patient reports a history of vague discomfort in the belly but denies any chest pain  back pain or lower limb weakness.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and has been a smoker for 40 years  with an average of 20 cigarettes per day. He was treated for a myocardial infarction five years ago. His surgical history includes having undergone an appendectomy at 20 years of age. There is a known family history of cardiovascular diseases but no known genetic diseases.  Investigations:  The patient's AAA measured 3.8 cm on the ultrasound scan  which is less than the surgical threshold of 5.5 cm. However  Mr. Smith's significant risk factors make his case more precarious and necessitates careful surveillance.  Treatment and Management:  Given Mr. Smith's AAA is below surgical threshold and currently asymptomatic  we are managing his condition conservatively with strict blood pressure control  aggressive lipid management and smoking cessation. He is being closely followed up at our clinic every six months with ultrasound scans to monitor for any increase in the size of his AAA.  Summary:  In summary  Mr. Smith represents a high-risk profile for the potential development of AAA complications given his age  gender  ethnicity  smoking history  and cardiovascular condition. His case underscores the reason why vigilant monitoring and management of risk factors is of utmost importance in the conservative management of an AAA.  Thank you. I am open for any questions or discussion. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,87,Subject: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Demographic Information: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired elementary school teacher and is currently living with his wife of 45 years. The patient lives in a suburban neighborhood and has maintained a relatively active lifestyle  including regular walks and gardening.  Past Medical History: The patient has a complicated medical history including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year history of smoking. He quit smoking ten years ago after a minor stroke but never received any endovascular intervention to manage the high-risk factors.   The patient's father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 71  which was managed surgically  hence there's a family history of AAA. He has known allergies to penicillin and ibuprofen. His medications include atenolol and simvastatin prescribed for his existing conditions.  Presentation: The patient attended the clinic complaining of sudden  severe  and constant pain in his lower back and abdomen. He described a pulsating sensation near his navel and he reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past two months. He denied any changes in bowel or bladder habits but mentioned feelings of lightheadedness and dizziness.  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected through palpation. Blood pressure reading showed 145/90 mmHg  and his pulse was irregular. As his symptomatology and medical history (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  old age  male gender  family history  and smoking) are highly suggestive of possible AAA  he has been referred for further diagnostic testing including ultrasound and computer-assisted tomography (CT) scanning.   Unfortunately  AAA is a silent condition until a life-threatening rupture occurs. This case underscores the need for routine screening for high-risk individuals  especially older males with a history of smoking and hypertension. Early detection increases the treatment options and can drastically improve prognosis.   As demographic data suggests  Caucasian males above 65  particularly those with a family history  exhibit higher prevalence rates for AAA. Although smoking rates have decreased over time  current and former smokers remain at elevated risk for developing this disease. Other risk factors may include hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Individuals who match these demographic and clinical traits should be considered for regular screening to ensure prompt diagnosis and management of this potentially lethal condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,88,Title: Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Demographic Information: Our patient today is Mr. Smith  an 80-year-old Caucasian male. He lives independently and is a retired engineer. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol usage.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant medical history which includes Hypertension  for which he takes an ACE inhibitor; Hyperlipidemia  managed through a statin therapy; and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which is controlled using Metformin. He also has a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).  Presenting Issue: Recently  Mr. Smith has been experiencing episodes of intermittent abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to his back. The pain has been non-continuous  episodic  and mild; however  the frequency has increased over the last two weeks. Due to this  he has experienced reduced appetite and resultant weight loss. No other significant clinical symptoms are associated including fever  nausea  vomiting  or change in bowel habits.  According to the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common in males over the age of 65  especially those with a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and atherosclerosis  all of which Mr. Smith represents.   Upon physical examination  a palpable abdominal mass was detected in the peri-umbilical area. This mass was pulsatile and slightly tender  raising suspicion of the possible presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  Next steps include further investigations such as an Abdominal Ultrasound and possibly a CT Angiography to confirm the diagnosis and ascertain the severity of his condition. Upon confirmation  an appropriate treatment plan can be considered  including possible surgical intervention if warranted by the size and risk of rupture.   Implementation of lifestyle changes are also to be advised such as reduction in alcohol consumption  regular exercise and a healthy diet to keep his comorbid conditions under control and prevent the progression of the aneurysm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,89,"Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male living in the Midwest region of the United States. He is a retired industrial worker and lives with his wife  with weekly visits from his adult children.   History: The patient has a past medical history notable for high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-year pack history of cigarette smoking but quit 10 years ago. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father dying from a stroke at the age of 76.  Presenting Issue: The patient arrived in the emergency room with sudden onset of severe abdominal and back pain  describing it as a tearing sensation  and the symptoms have drawn concern for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient also reports mild lightheadedness and feeling of """"impending doom """" but denies chest pain  shortness of breath  and loss of consciousness.  Physical Examination: The patient appeared uncomfortable due to pain but was otherwise alert and oriented. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg  heart rate of 100 bpm  and respiratory rate of 16 bpm. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen. Laboratory test results are pending.  Demographic Background: Abdominal aortic aneurysms primarily affect older adults  particularly men over 65 years of age. According to epidemiological studies  abdominal aortic aneurysms are most prevalent in Caucasians  especially those of European descent. Men are four times more likely than women to develop AAA  and there is a strong correlation with a history of cigarette smoking and hypertension. It is also notable that 1 in 4 patients with AAA have a first-degree relative who has also had an AAA  indicating a potential genetic predisposition.  Close monitoring  early detection and timely intervention are crucial for patients with an AAA to prevent life-threatening rupture. The clinician team must collaborate to provide optimal medical management and surgical intervention if necessary."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,90,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile:  Mr. John Baker is a 72 years old Caucasian male  currently residing in the suburbs of Chicago  IL. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has a history of smoking  consuming about a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years. He is also moderately overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.  Medical History: Mr. Baker has an established past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily). He reports compliance with these medications. He had a heart attack ten years ago  requiring a stenting procedure. He had also undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy approximately five years ago.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Baker presented with an intermittent  vague abdominal pain  particularly post meals  associated with unexplained weight loss over the past three months. The pain has not been acutely severe  but persistent and out of character enough for him to seek medical attention. He has also noticed a """"pulsing sensation"""" within his abdomen.  Family History: His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease. His father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture in his late seventies and his elder brother  age 76  is currently living with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Summary: Considering his age  medical history  lifestyle  and family history  Mr. Baker presents an archetypical profile of a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) as described in medical literature. AAA predominately affects elderly men over the age of 65 and is associated with a history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  and family history.    His periodic abdominal pain  the pulsing sensation he felt in his abdomen  and unexplained weight loss were indicative of a potential abdominal aortic aneurysm  and appropriate diagnostic investigations were proceeded with to confirm this suspicion. It is of utmost importance to promptly diagnose and manage AAA  given its potential to rupture leading to a life-threatening situation. The treatment also requires careful consideration of Mr. Baker's overall health and comorbid conditions. "
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,91,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Older Adult Male  Patient Profile: Mr. S.  a 70-year-old Caucasian male retired truck driver  presents with a chief complaint of severe  sudden-onset pain in the back and lower abdomen. He also reports faintness  and an increased heart rate. A resident of a small town in Texas  where he lives with his wife  he is a former smoker with a 20-year pack history until he quit 15 years ago. Mr. S. has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension which is managed with medication. He does not have a history of any other significant illnesses or surgeries.   Background: His lifestyle involves minimal physical activity and his diet includes high-cholesterol foods due to his long years on the road. Normally with a high pain threshold  he described a sudden strange sensation  'like a ripping feeling’  which made him seek immediate medical help.   Medical History: He was diagnosed 10 years ago with high blood pressure  for which he has been non-compliant with his medication. He has a family history of aneurysms (both parents died from ruptured aneurysms) making him a high-risk patient. There have been no previously documented or diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).  Current Presentation: On physical examination  he appears uncomfortable  and vital signs indicate a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 160/95mmHg  respiratory rate 22 per minute and oxygen saturation on room air is 98%. Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass and minor tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen. He was sent for an urgent CT which confirmed an AAA of 7 5cm diameter.  This presentation is a prototypical AAA case  given that it is most prominent among Caucasian males aged 65 to 75 who have a history of smoking and a history of aneurysms in the immediate family. It is notable that AAAs tend to be asymptomatic until rupture  at which point they have a very high fatality rate. Mr. S.'s immediate presentation was critical in his receiving potentially life-saving care. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,92,Slide 1: Patient Information Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 72 Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Firefighter Residential Area: Manhattan  New York Ethnicity: Caucasian  Slide 2: Patient Presentation Chief Complain: Severe  sudden pain in the back and lower abdomen  persisting for several hours. Additional Symptoms: Nausea  cold feet with weak or absent pulses  clammy and pale skin.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension controlled with medication  moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed around a decade ago  and a smoking history of 25 pack-years. No known allergies. History of occasional alcohol consumption.  Slide 4: Family Medical History The patient's father suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 75 and his mother died due to stroke at 80. His older brother has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.  Slide 5: AAA Prevalence and Risk Factors  Abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalently affects males above 65 years of age  particularly those from Caucasian descent. Risk factors include a family history of the disease  smoking  and hypertension. Chronic lung diseases like COPD and atherosclerosis are also considered contributing factors.  Slide 6: Demographic Representation According to National Institute of Health  the prevalence rate of AAA is higher among males and Caucasian individuals aged 65 and above.  Slide 7: Conclusion Given Mr. Doe's age  smoking history  family history of AAA  hypertension  and his COPD diagnosis  he fits the typical profile for an individual susceptible to an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Immediate medical attention and treatment are necessary to reduce the risks and manage his condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,93,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Male  Demographics:  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 72 years  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Businessman  Clinical History:  Mr. Doe is a 72-year old Caucasian male  living with his wife. He is moderately active for his age and enjoys gardening and daily walks. He is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol use. He has a history of high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia  both managed by medication. There is no significant family history of cardiovascular or aneurysmal disease.  He has been experiencing chronic lower back pain and abdominal discomfort for the past few months. Recently  the patient observed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  primarily after meals. Using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  he rated his pain as a 3 out of 10. There is no history of unexplained weight loss  fever  or night sweats.  Physical Examination:  On examination  a pulsatile  expansile abdominal mass was appreciated in the peri-umbilical region. There was mild tenderness on palpation around the mass  but no signs of peritonitis were found.  Additional Findings:  An abdominal ultrasound showed a localized  5.5 cm suprarenal dilation of the abdominal aorta  which is in line with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. No rupture was evident on the scan.  Comment:  Mr. Doe represents the typical patient demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)  which is predominately seen in Caucasian men over the age of 65. The condition is associated with risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that Mr. Doe has presented in his history.  The back pain and palpable abdominal mass experienced by Mr. Doe are classical AAA symptoms  but not always present. The pulsating feeling might be associated with expansion of the aneurysm  particularly after food intake increases abdominal pressure.  Conclusion:  Next steps for Mr. Doe are likely to include further investigations with CT angiography  to ascertain the exact size  location and potential involvement of other structures. Depending on these findings  he will likely be referred to a vascular surgeon for ongoing treatment and management.  As AAA carries a high risk of rupture leading to life-threatening hemorrhage  identifying and proactively managing this condition is of utmost importance. Since AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture  clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in older patients  especially those with risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as seen in Mr. Doe's case.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,94,"Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Presentation: Mr. M  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department with a complain of acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain. The pain is sharp  persistent and radiates to his lower back. He states the pain as """"the worst pain he's ever experienced"""". Mr. M appears distressed and diaphoretic.  Demographics: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is more prevalent in older individuals  particularly men over the age of 65. In the United States  4-8% of older men and 1-2% of older women are affected and the demographic statistics reflect a higher prevalence among White populations compared to Black or Hispanic populations.   Past Medical History: Mr. M was a heavy smoker for 40 years  but quit 10 years ago. He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of aortic disease (his father died of a ruptured AAA at the age of 75). He took oral medication that was well-controlled with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Mr. M did not have a history of previous surgery or any allergies. His social history revealed that he consumed alcohol socially and had a diet of moderate fat intake.   Presenting Signs: Upon initial physical examination  Mr. M's heart rate was reported at 110 bpm and his blood pressure was noted to be 160/90 mm Hg. On auscultation  a bruit was heard on his mid-abdominal area. The abdominal examination revealed a palpable  pulsatile mass which was tender on deep palpation.   In the context of his medical and family history  as well as his presenting symptoms  an emergent ultrasound was ordered  demonstrating an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6.5cm  supporting the suspicion of a rapidly expanding or ruptured AAA.   The comprehensive management approach for Mr. M incorporates multidisciplinary care that includes prompt surgical intervention coupled with management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia in a postoperative phase. His demographic information and history significantly place him at a greater risk  necessitating urgent attention. Regular follow-ups intend to manage Mr. M's risk factors and monitor his recovery."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,95,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  married  and a retired engineer living in the urban areas. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  with a smoking history of 50 pack years. He occasionally drinks alcohol and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting symptoms: The patient presented asymptomatic of any abdominal discomfort or back pain. However  he reported a slowly enlarging  pulsatile mass in his abdomen  which he started noticing about 2 months ago. His primary concern is the recent sudden increase in the size of this mass.  Past Medical History: In his past medical records  the patient has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years  which he manages with oral anti-hypertensive medications. He also has borderline dyslipidemia. His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 73. He does not have any history of allergies  diabetes  or chronic kidney disease.  Surgical History: He underwent an appendectomy at the age of 25 and a right total hip replacement at the age of 65.  Family History: As mentioned earlier  there is a family history of aortic aneurysm (his father). His mother died in her late 80s due to Alzheimer's disease. He is the eldest of 3 siblings  none of whom have any known cardiovascular or aneurysmal disease.  Current Medications: The patient is currently on ramipril for hypertension and takes atorvastatin for dyslipidemia.  Clinical Findings: Upon initial examination  there is a noticeable pulsatile mass in his abdomen. His vitals are stable  with a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg.  This fairly common presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is aligned with the typical demographic and lifestyle factors outlined in various research studies: older age  male  Caucasian ethnicity  smoker  hypertensive  dyslipidemia  and a family history of the disease. The subsequent steps would include confirmatory diagnostic procedures like ultrasound or CT scan to determine the size of the aneurysm and potential need for surgical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,96,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation  Patient Presentation: Mr. James Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  presents to the emergency department complaining of abrupt onset severe abdominal pain for approximately four hours. The pain  described as a tearing sensation  is centralized around his navel and radiates to his back.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for about 40 years but has been smoke-free for the past four years. He has a longstanding history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  controlled by prescribed medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin).  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient is in distress. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 bpm. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass and severe tenderness around the navel.  Epidemiology: Male individuals aged between 65 to 75 years old who have a history of smoking are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Caucasian men are more likely to develop AAA compared to other ethnic and racial groups. In addition  patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also at increased risk.  Conclusion: Given Mr. Rodriguez's age  gender  race  and history—especially his significant smoking history—along with his current symptoms and clinical findings  there is a crucial suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Urgent diagnostic and therapeutic management are essential.  References: The risk factors and patient presentation are gathered from the commonly seen demographics in the literature. For example  Smoking and Hypertension are agreed by most studies to be significant risk factors for AAA. The demographic information was found from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  which showed that Caucasian males over 60  particularly those with a history of smoking  are at a higher risk. The presentation and history align with guidance from the Mayo Clinic and other prominent medical reference sources.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,97,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  has presented with symptoms indicative of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Chief Complaints: Mr. Smith primarily complains of occasional severe abdominal pain that tends to radiate to the back. He also reports a noticeable pulsating feeling near his navel.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is also a 40-pack-year smoker but quit smoking 5 years ago due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His father died from a ruptured AAA at the age of 75.  Physical Examination: On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated  more noticeable during expiration. There are no signs of limb ischemia. The patient continues to have a slightly elevated blood pressure at 145/95 mmHg.  Based on epidemiological research  men  particularly those of Caucasian descent  aged 65 and older who have a history of smoking and cardiovascular diseases have a high prevalence of AAA. Mr. Smith's demographics and medical history align well with these risk factors. Additionally  his symptomatology further suggests the presence of an AAA.  Due to the life-threating nature of ruptured AAA  it is imperative to further evaluate his condition. Mr. Smith should have an expedited referral for an ultrasound examination to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for any imminent risk of rupture.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,99,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Introduction: Today  we are discussing Mr. Ramirez  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Mr. Ramirez is a retired mechanical engineer  a passionate gardener  and enthusiastic in his community's local history club. He was recently divorced and lives alone.  Current Medical Presentation: Mr. Ramirez visited the Emergency Department  complaining of an intense  sudden-onset abdominal and lower back pain that he described as unlike anything he ever experienced. He also reported feeling an unusual pulsing sensation in his abdomen. He was pale and diaphoretic on arrival  and his vitals showed a blood pressure of 130/75 mmHg and pulse rate of 90 beats per minute.   Past Medical & Family History: Mr. Ramirez has a medical history of hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  both controlled by medication. He had a 40 pack-year smoking history  which he quit 10 years ago. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption  though he hasn’t consumed any alcohol in the last five years. His father died from an AAA rupture at the age of 77.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a slightly distended abdomen  and a palpable  pulsatile abdominal mass was also noted. His cardiovascular and respiratory systems were normal.  Investigation and Diagnosis: An urgent CT Abdomen was performed  confirming the presence of an AAA measuring 7.5cm in maximum diameter. No signs of leakage or rupture were identified.   Given the patient's age  gender  medical history  particularly his smoking and family history  he fits the most common demographic for an AAA. Mr. Ramirez was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for further treatment.  Discussion: The AAA prevalence is highest in Caucasian males aged over 65. Risk factors include atherosclerosis  smoking history  hypertension  and a family history of AAA. AAA often remains asymptomatic until rupture  with only 25% of AAAs diagnosed before rupture. Severe  sudden-onset abdominal and back pain is often the first presentation  as in the case of Mr. Ramirez.  This case underscores the importance of considering AAA in older male patients with a history of smoking and sudden and severe abdominal pain  even if the pain had developed in a patient who lives alone and may delay seeking medical care. Swift diagnosis and referral for surgical management are essential to lower the high mortality rate associated with ruptured AAAs.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,1,100,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Geriatric Male Patient  Mr. Joseph Dowling  a 72-year-old Caucasian man  presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain  which he described as severe  situated mostly in the middle and lower part of his stomach. The pain was sudden in onset  persisting for about three hours before presenting to the Emergency Department. He reports a sudden pain that started in his belly and radiates to his back.  Mr. Dowling  currently retired  is a former Marine Corps member. He has been a smoker for over 50 years  consuming an average of one pack per day. He occasionally consumes alcohol  mostly during social gatherings. His dietary history reveals a high-fat diet.  In terms of family history  his father died of a stroke while his mother passed away due to heart disease. His older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair at the age of 78. He is married with three grown children.  His medical history includes hypertension  which has been controlled with Lisinopril for over a decade. He also has hyperlipidemia  managed with Atorvastatin. Mr. Dowling denies any history of cancer  respiratory illness  liver disease  or surgery other than for an appendectomy during his youth.  Upon further investigation  a pulsating mass was palpable in his abdomen. His EKG showed a regular rhythm  and his vital signs were stable except for mild hypertension.  Mr. Dowling fits the typical demographic of an AAA patient. The literature suggests that the condition is most common in Caucasian men over 65 with a history of smoking  hypertension  and a family history of aneurysm. His high-fat diet also predisposes him to atherosclerosis  which can contribute to aneurysm formation.   The suddenness and severity of his pain indicate a possible rupture  which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical attention. His medical history  particularly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  signifies vascular health concerns that may have compounded over the years  creating a potential environment for AAA development and progression.  The inclusion of this case in clinical research would contribute to the nuanced understanding of AAA risk factors  progress  and outcomes in this demographic. Crucially  Mr. Dowling's case underscores the necessity for consistent monitoring  lifestyle modification  and preventive measures in at-risk individuals.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,1,A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe lower back and abdominal pain that began a couple of hours ago. The pain is described as a ripping or tearing sensation and is constant  radiating to the back and lower abdomen. He also reports mild shortness of breath and is looking pale.   The patient has a history of hypertension for 20 years  and smoking one pack per day for over 35 years  but quit two years ago. He also has a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms: his father died suddenly of a ruptured aorta.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,3,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset abdominal and lower back pain  which he describes as a tearing sensation. The pain is not relieved by over-the-counter pain relievers. He has a 10-year history of hypertension and a 30-year pack history of smoking  both risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He has not had any previous imaging of his aorta. He also reports occasional feelings of lightheadedness and nausea. On examination  the patient appears uncomfortable and in distress. On palpation  a pulsatile abdominal mass is found. His blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg and his heart rate is 110 bpm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,4,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen  radiating to his groin and buttocks. The patient initially describes the pain as a tearing sensation.   Over the last few months  he's noticed a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  which he dismissed due to his lack of other symptoms. He also reports a loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.  Detailed History:  The patient is a retired engineer who has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. He is a moderate drinker and does not use elicit drugs. His family history is notable for vascular disease; his father suffered a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in his early 70s.   His medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral vascular disease  all of which have been treated with medication for the past 10 years. He has not undergone any surgical procedures in the past. His medications are Amlodipine Olmesartan 5/40mg for hypertension  Atorvastatin 20mg for hyperlipidemia  and Aspirin 81mg for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  On Examination:  Vitals show a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. Palpation of the abdomen reveals a pulsating mass that is tender to touch. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.  Based on his age  family history of AAA  smoking history  the presence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  the patient was considered to be of high risk for AAA. Therefore  radiological imaging was ordered to confirm the diagnosis  and emergency surgical consultation was sought due to the possibility of rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,5,"A 72-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the Emergency Department with deep  steady  persistent abdominal and back pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature  radiating to his lower back. The pain began suddenly  about two hours ago  while he was watching TV at home. His vital signs on arrival were: Blood pressure 170/95mmHg  Pulse rate 98 bpm  Respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  SpO2 97% on room air  and Temperature of 37.1°C.  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 20 years  managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin. He also has 60 pack-year smoking history  having smoked two packs a day for 30 years before quitting ten years ago. The patient has been non-compliant with his regular health check-ups and his last abdominal ultrasound was done five years ago which was normal. The patient lives alone  he stopped working 7 years ago  has a moderate alcohol consumption of two drinks per day  and no known drug allergies. He denies any family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms or any sudden cardiac deaths in his family.  Due to all these factors  concerning demographic data  and a high-risk medical history  the patient is suspected to have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) which was later confirmed by CT angiography. Emergency vascular surgery review was called."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,6,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with sudden onset  severe abdominal and lower back pain that started roughly two hours ago. The pain is constant  non-radiating  and non-reliant on movement or position. It is described as a """"ripping"""" sensation. He also reports feeling light-headed and having difficulty standing due to the pain. His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a 40-pack-year history of smoking (ceased 10 years ago)  and a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms with his father having died from aneurysm rupture.  On observation  Mr. Smith is a thin elderly man who appears older than his stated age  alert  in distress. He has an abdominal bruit present on auscultation and pulse exam demonstrated a pulsatile mass in the midline lower abdomen. The patient’s vitals are stable with a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg  heart rate of 105 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  temperature of 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His BMI is 24.2. Cardiovascular  respiratory  and other systemic examination findings are within normal limits.  Initial differential diagnosis would consider acute aortic syndromes such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture or aortic dissection  given his risk factors of age  gender  prior smoking history  presence of hypertension  and family history. A stat CT scan is recommended for further investigation."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,7,Patient Presentation:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male comes into the emergency room with severe  sudden onset of abdominal and lower-back pain  described as a tearing sensation.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,51,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of severe and worsening abdominal pain radiated to the back  localized in the middle or lower abdomen. The patient described the pain as sudden and sharp  starting about two hours ago. He felt a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  associated with nausea and mild shortness of breath.  The patient has a significant past medical history including a 35-year pack history of smoking  hypertension managed with ACE inhibitors  and high cholesterol treated with statins. His hypertension was not well controlled with fluctuating readings reported at his GP’s office. His father had suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 78.  On examination  his blood pressure was 163/97 mmHg in his right arm and 159/96 mmHg in his left arm. His abdominal exam revealed a significant pulsatile mass in the abdominal periumbilical region which was tender to palpation. However  his distal pulses were +2 and equal bilaterally. The remainder of his physical exam was within normal limits.  Given the clinical suspicion for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  the patient was promptly ordered a computed tomography angiography (CTA) which confirmed a 7.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a nearby hematoma  likely representing a contained rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,52,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack year smoking history. He presented with a chief complaint of intermittent lower back pain for approximately two months. The pain is described as a deep  gnawing  lower back pain unrelated to physical activity. It has been largely stable in character and intensity until recently when the intensity and frequency began to increase. There are no other associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  altered bowel habits  urinary complaints  or lower limb weakness.  On examination  the patient appears comfortable at rest. His vital signs are: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate 80/ min  respiratory rate 18/min  temperature 98.6 F  and saturation 94% on room air. Auscultation of the abdomen reveals a pulsatile mass of approximately 5 cm in the periumbilical area. The rest of the physical examination is normal.  On further questioning  he admits to sporadic follow up and uncontrolled hypertension likely due to non adherence to his antihypertensive medication. He quit smoking 10 years ago. His father died of a """"ruptured blood vessel in the abdomen"""" in his 70s.    Given the history  physical examination and demographics  differential diagnoses include an enlarging atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm versus an aortic dissection. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide further therapy.   (Demographic representation - men and those over 65 are more likely to develop an AAA. Others at high risk include smokers and those with a family history of AAA)."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,53,Patient Presentation:   Mr. James  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen. He describes the pain as tearing and radiating down to his legs  rating it as an 8/10 on the pain scale. He admits to feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. Additionally  he reports feeling lightheaded with bouts of nausea.   Past Medical History:   Mr. James is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but had a 30 pack-year history prior to quitting. He has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are well-managed with prescribed medications. His father passed away at the age of 74 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   This presentation fits closely with epidemiological data which suggests that abdominal aortic aneurysms most commonly occur in older  Caucasian men. Further  risk factors for such aneurysms include being a smoker or former smoker  having a history of hypertension or hyperlipidemia  and having a family history of the condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,54,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents with unrelenting  severe abdominal and lower back pain for the last couple of hours.

The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 45 pack-year smoking  but quit smoking 10 years ago. The patient denies any history of trauma or injury. He also denies alcohol or drug abuse. There is a family history of aortic aneurysm; his father died at the age of 74 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. His medications include Lisinopril 20mg daily and Simvastatin 20mg daily. On physical examination  the patient appears in acute pain. A palpable  pulsatile abdominal mass is noted in the midline of the abdomen  just above the umbilicus. The pain onset  intensity  vomiting and palpable pulsating abdominal mass arouse the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient's high-risk factors  such as his sex  age  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of AAA  further increase this suspicion. Urgent medical attention and imaging are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent intervention.

Given the patient's age  gender  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass  there is a strong suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,78,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department complaining of a severe  pulsating abdominal pain that started abruptly and has been increasing over the last couple of hours. He also reports experiencing back pain  and some mild nausea. Patient has a known history of hypertension and has been a smoker for more than 40 years. His paternal side of the family has a history of vascular diseases  his father passed away from an aortic dissection. On physical examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable in the mid-abdominal area. No sudden drop in blood pressure or signs of shock are observed  suggesting a possible contained rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patient's last recorded blood pressure was stable  and he does not have any known allergies. No history of previous abdominal surgeries. Adheres to medication prescribed for hypertension regularly.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,79,A 71-year-old Caucasian male presents with complaints of uncharacteristic back pain and abdominal discomfort for the past several days. The patient explains the back pain as a throbbing sensation that comes and goes  but he notes the pain seems to grow stronger during his bowel movements. The abdominal discomfort is centered lower than his stomach and vaguely radiates towards his groin. He also reports unintentional weight loss over the past weeks.  The patient's medical history is complex with underlying health conditions such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year history of smoking  though he recently quit 4 years ago. He has no known allergies but does take medication for his chronic health conditions  including atorvastatin and lisinopril.   Family history includes a brother who passed away from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 68  and both parents suffered from cardiovascular disease. The patient recently retired from his job as a truck driver  which he held for over 40 years.  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is noticed.   These symptoms  medical history  and physical examination findings suggest the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which needs further diagnostic investigation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,80,Patient Presentation: John  a 72-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with intense abdominal and back pain that began acutely today. He describes the pain as a constant  pulsating sensation in the mid-lower part of his abdomen and radiating to his back. He also reports feeling mildly nauseous and dizzy when standing up.  Past Medical History: John has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus and tobacco use. He was diagnosed with these conditions 15 years ago and is under medication (Metoprolol 50mg daily for hypertension  Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes). He has smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for over 40 years. He has no known drug allergy. He also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 10 years ago. His family history is significant for cardiac disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at a similar age.  Relevant Findings: On exam  his BP is 160/90 mmHg  pulse is 110 bpm  and temp is 98.7°F. His abdomen is soft with a pulsatile mass present in the midline. His systemic examination revealed no abnormal findings. His labs reveal a slightly elevated white blood cell count. He is immediately sent for a CT scan which confirms the presence of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  This demographic is chosen based on the fact that epidemiologically  75% of AAA cases are male and they are more common in whites than African Americans. However  the mortality rate is higher in African Americans due to delay in diagnosis and therapy. Additionally  the average age at the time of diagnosis is usually between 65 and 75  and hypertension  cigarette smoking  personal history of other vascular aneurysms  and male sex are strong risk factors. Diabetes  on the other hand  is inversely associated with the risk of AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,81,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old African-American male  presents to the Emergency Department complaining of severe abdominal and back pain that started suddenly a few hours ago. He describes the pain as a constant  pulsating feeling near his navel  and it appears to radiate to his lower back.   Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 50 pack-year smoking history  though he quit smoking 5 years ago. He also has a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 10 years back and has been on regular follow-up.  His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  which makes him particularly anxious about his current symptoms. He is retired and lives with his wife who is his primary caregiver. He denies alcohol or drug use and maintains a balanced diet.  On physical examination  there's a visible pulsation in his abdomen  and on auscultation  a bruit is apprehended over his abdomen. His blood pressure is slightly elevated.  Considering his age  sex  race  smoking history  family history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  presence of PAD  COPD  and his symptoms  the suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is high. An urgent CT scan is ordered to confirm diagnosis and assess the size and extent of the aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,82,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the clinic with a complaint of unexplained  constant  and severe pain in his lower back and abdominal region radiating towards the groin area for the past days. He reports the pain to be 7 out of 10 on the pain scale and it has made his daily activities difficult. The patient doesn't recall any recent trauma or heavy physical activity that could have triggered the pain. He also reports feeling unusually fatigued and has noticed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. No associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or fever were reported.   History reveals him to be a smoker  with a 40-year pack history. He has a prior history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled on medication. The patient denies any history of surgery. Familial history is significant  with his elder brother undergoing surgical repair for an abdominal aortic aneurysm 10 years ago. He does not consume any alcohol  illicit drugs  and is retired from his job as a truck driver. He is currently on amlodipine 5mg for hypertension and atorvastatin 20mg for hyperlipidemia.  On examination  the patient appears anxious and discomforted. Vital signs show a blood pressure of 148/95 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute  body temperature of 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals a palpable pulsatile mass in the mid-epigastric region. No bruits were detected. Rest of the examination maintains within normal limits.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,83,Patient Presentation:   A 73-year-old Caucasian male walks into the clinic complaining of persistent abdominal and back pain that has worsened over the past few weeks. The pain is dull and aching in nature  located in the lower back and the middle of the abdomen  not related to meals or posture  without any radiation. He has been experiencing spells of lightheadedness  but denies any chest pain  palpitations  breathlessness  or syncope.   He has a history of smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years. He also has a significant past medical history  including hypertension for 15 years  which is currently controlled on medication  and hyperlipidemia. There is also a familial history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. The patient is retired  lives alone  and his wife died 3 years back.   On examination  the patient is in moderate discomfort secondary to pain. His vitals are stable  abdomen examination reveals a pulsatile mass  palpable in the upper midline of the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. The clinical suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is high.  Note: The demographic details in this scenario represent the demographic group (older  male  Caucasian  smokers  hypertensive  and individuals with a family history of cardiovascular diseases) most often diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms as per medical literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,84,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents with an aching abdominal discomfort  located mainly in the lower back and flanks. The pain is described as a constant  dull ache that has been consistent for the past week. There is no associated fever  nausea  vomiting  changes in bowel or bladder habits.   He has a past history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which have been controlled with medication for 15 years. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago  with a 30-pack year smoking history. He self-reports limited physical activity and a diet that is high in saturated fats. His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 78  providing a family history of the condition.  On examination  there is a palpable  pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen. His systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg and his pulse rate is 88 bpm.  The patient's age  gender  smoking history and family history place him in a higher risk category for abdominal aortic aneurysm. His cardiovascular history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia also increases his risk. The presence of the palpable mass in his abdomen and the back pain he is experiencing are both indicative of a potential aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,85,A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal and lower back pain localized to the center of his abdomen and radiating to his back. The pain is constant  rated as 9 out of 10 in severity  and is not relieved by changing positions or any other maneuvers. He also reported lightheadedness and a fainting spell at the time of pain onset. He has a history of high blood pressure and a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in his late 70s. The patient does not regularly access healthcare and has not had any imaging of his abdomen in the past. He denies any known allergies to food or medication.   On examination  his blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg and his pulse is 110 beats per minute. There is marked tenderness to light palpation in the central abdomen and the lower back. Examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. The remainder of the physical exam  including cardiovascular and respiratory examination  is unremarkable. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white cell count  and a moderate degree of anemia. An urgent computed tomographic angiography is obtained  confirming the suspicion of a large ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He is promptly referred for emergent endovascular surgery.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,86,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department with severe  unrelenting lower abdominal and back pain  which began a few hours ago. The pain is described as a sharp  tearing sensation that radiates to his lower back  is unlike anything he has experienced previously  and is associated with nausea and lightheadedness. On further probing  Mr. Doe also reports feeling a pulsating mass in his abdomen.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Doe has a long history of smoking  spanning more than 50 years  averaging one pack a day. His medical history includes hypertension  high cholesterol  and peripheral artery disease  all of which have been managed with medication for about a decade. There is also a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having passed at a relatively young age due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His paternal grandfather also died of a stroke and his older brother has coronary artery disease.  Lifestyle:   Mr. Doe is retired but leads an active lifestyle. He lives with his wife and continues to smoke  though he states that he has cut down in recent years. Despite his various health conditions  he does little in the way of diet or lifestyle modification.      Medications:  He currently takes a daily aspirin  atorvastatin for his cholesterol  and amlodipine for his hypertension. Due to his peripheral artery disease  he also takes clopidogrel.  This presentation is consistent with literature  as abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common in males over the age of 65  particularly those with a history of chronic conditions such as heart disease  hypertension  and high cholesterol. A family history of vascular disease  and lifestyle factors such as long-term smoking  are known risk factors. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,87,A 71-year-old Caucasian male presents to the Emergency department with severe  sudden onset of lower back and abdominal pain  which he describes as a tearing sensation. His pain has been progressively worsening over the last few hours. He also mentions feeling lightheaded and has experienced one episode of vomiting. He denies chest pain or difficulty in urination. However  he acknowledges a history of uncontrolled hypertension and is currently using an anti-hypertensive medication. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia about ten years ago. He retired as a construction worker and claims regular alcohol consumption. His brother also had an aneurysm at the age of 65. The patient seems anxious  with diaphoresis. On examination  pulsatile abdominal mass is noted. Family history reveals his brother also suffered from an aneurysm. Review of his past medical records reveals that a 3-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm was incidentally detected on an ultrasound a couple of years ago. ASPRIN was advised at the time but he had been non-compliant with regular checkups and follow-ups since the discovery.   Based on the patient's age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  alcohol use  and family history  his risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm are present. The fact that he was previously diagnosed with a smaller aneurysm increases the likelihood that the current presentation could be due to the rapid expansion or rupture of the aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,88,A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a moderate-severe central abdominal pain radiating to his lower back that started suddenly about three hours ago. The pain is described as tearing in nature and he rates it high on a pain scale from 0-10. Along with pain  he also notices an unusual pulsatile sensation in his abdomen  but denies any associated nausea  vomiting  or bowel changes. He has experienced mild intermittent abdominal discomfort before  but the current pain is much more severe and persistent.  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and peripheral artery disease. He is a smoker of 50 pack-years and reports a moderate intake of alcohol. His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm which was repaired surgically when he was around the same age.  On examination  the patient appears diaphoretic and anxious. A pulsatile abdominal mass can be palpated with the pain becoming more severe on palpation  blood pressure is on the higher side and heart rate is elevated. Femoral pulses are reduced with lower extremity skin appearing pale and cool. With these findings and family history  a strong possibility of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected. An immediate CT scan with contrast is ordered for the definitive diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,89,A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with severe  sharp  and sudden pain in his lower back and belly that seems to radiate to his groin. The patient describes it as the worst pain he has ever experienced and rates it a 10 on a scale of 1-10. The pain was sudden in onset  with no evident provocation. He also complains of feeling light-headed and notes the recent onset of constipation. He has a past medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a 40-year pack history of smoking. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  including his father who died suddenly at age 68 from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. On further assessment  a pulsatile mass in his abdomen is noted  and his lower extremities are cool to touch with barely perceptible pulses.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,90,A 73-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain that started a few hours ago. He describes the pain as stabbing  rating it 10 out of 10 in intensity. He also reports a feeling of faintness and refers to having nearly passed out after the pain started. He denies having had any recent injuries  he have not undergone any surgeries  and he mentions that he doesn't have any known allergies.  In terms of past medical history  he reveals that he has been a smoker for 50 years with an average consumption of 20 cigarettes a day  and he has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which have been managed with regular antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication. He has been noted to have a lack of compliance with his medication regimen. Despite being advised to follow a low-sodium and low-cholesterol diet  his intake has been inconsistent.  Upon examination  the patient appears to be restless and is sweating profusely. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Upon palpation  he has a pulsatile abdominal mass that is very tender to touch. Given his history  his symptoms  and his clinical findings  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,91,Patient Presentation:   A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe  tearing abdominal pain and back pain. The pain is noted to be most severe in the lower abdomen and has been constant for the past three hours. The patient describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced and unlike previous bouts of mundane abdominal discomfort. He also reports symptoms of nausea  but no vomiting  diarrhea or blood in stool. Patient appears pale and distressed.   Past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and long-term tobacco use (30 pack-years). The patient is on antihypertensives and statins which he has been compliant with. His father had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  On examination  a pulsatile mass can be palpated in the periumbilical region slightly to the left of midline. His blood pressure is found to be borderline low with elevated pulse rate. Further diagnostic imaging is immediately required to confirm the clinical suspicion of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient's age  race  sex  and history of smoking and hypertension all put him at a high risk for the development and rupture of AAA  necessitating immediate surgical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,92,A 67-year-old Hispanic male presents at the ER with severe  sudden onset back pain  which he describes as a tearing sensation. The pain seemed to start in his abdomen and radiate toward his back. On further questioning  he admits to having felt a strange pulsating sensation in his abdomen over the past month  which he ascribed to gastrointestinal issues. He has a 20-year history of hypertension  for which he takes his prescription medication irregularly. Additionally  he has a 45-pack-year smoking history  although he quit 5 years ago. He has been diagnosed with high cholesterol 10 years ago  and he admits his diet has been poor throughout his life. His father died in his sixties from a heart attack  and his older brother had surgery for an aneurysm in his stomach a few years ago. The patient's vitals are stable; blood pressure is high at 164/92 mm Hg. On examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable in his abdomen. There is no evidence of lower extremity edema or neurological deficit  indicating potential rupture. His high-risk factors and presenting symptoms make an abdominal aortic aneurysm a probable diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,93,"A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset lower back and abdominal pain that started a few hours ago. Pain is described as """"tearing"""" in nature and radiates down to his lower abdomen and groin area. He also complains of some associated nausea and lightheadedness.

On physical examination  the patient appears distressed. His BP is 90/60 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 24 breathes per minute  and temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper parts of the abdomen. He has slight abdominal distension and abdominal tenderness.   
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,96,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. James Smith is a 71-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the clinic today with a complaint of mild but persistent abdominal pain that he has been experiencing for the last few weeks. He describes the pain as a """"gnawing"""" sensation that's seemingly centered in the midst of his abdomen  slightly towards his back  but not severe enough to disrupt his daily activities. The pain has been more noticeable while he's standing and somewhat relieved when lying flat.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is hypertensive and has a history of smoking about a packet of cigarettes a day for 45 years  although he quit smoking 7 years ago. His father passed away from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 74  which is a key piece of family history to take note of. He denies history of trauma  recent heavy lifting  or a sudden increase in physical exertion.  Current medications he is taking are for the management of his hypertension  high cholesterol  and type 2 diabetes mellitus which include Lisinopril  Atorvastatin  and Metformin respectively.  Socioeconomic Details:  He is a retired engineer  lives with his wife at their own home. He does not consume alcohol and denies illicit drug use.  The patient's clinical picture and history suggests abdominal aortic aneurysm requiring further investigations and confirmation by ultrasound or CT scan. The patient's significant smoking history  age  the presence of chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes  and family history suggest increased risk for this pathology as represented in various medical literature. Furthermore  male gender and Caucasian decent are also established risk factors."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,97,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Miller  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  comes into the office reporting a sensation of deep  persistent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort. The pain has been progressively increasing over the last month  but it became more noticeable in the past week. He also recalls a few episodes of feeling abnormally full after meals  in spite of consuming small quantities of food. He was a smoker but quit 10 years ago.   He has a medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  Marfan's syndrome  and a family history of cardiac diseases. He does not consume alcohol  denied any history of drug abuse  and has been compliant with his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. He reports no allergy to any known substances.  On examination  an abdominal pulsatile mass approximately 5 cm in length was palpable. A preliminary diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is made based on the patient's age  sex  symptoms  and physical examination findings  and is scheduled for a confirmatory abdominal ultrasound.  Note: While not all demographic details may apply to every patient with AAA (as the condition can affect people of varying ages  sexes  and races)  the majority of patients with AAA tend to be older  male  Caucasian and may have a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  Marfan's syndrome or a family history of cardiac diseases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2,98,A 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Stevenson  reports to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset of abdominal and back pain that's radiating to his back. His past medical history reveals that he is an active smoker with hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years. He is currently on anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. He has a family history of aneurysms  with his father deceased from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Mr. Stevenson also reports a fast heartbeat  shortness of breath and feeling dizzy for the past few hours. He denies any bowel or bladder changes. His body mass index (BMI) is 30 and he leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle.   Upon clinical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is palpated in the central and lower part of his abdomen that's consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His blood pressure is significantly elevated  further increasing the suspicion of a possible pathological process involving the aortic region.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,1,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Elderly Male  Slide 1: Introduction  - Patient reference: Mr. X - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Male - Nationality: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired engineer    Slide 2: Presenting Complaint - Mr. X presents with unwitnessed sporadic back pain over the last few weeks. - Recently  a continuous  pulsating sensation in the abdomen  not specifically related to meals or certain positions.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - Hypertension managed with medication for the past 10 years.  - 40 pack-year smoking history  but quit smoking 5 years ago. - History of hyperlipidemia. - No history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease.   Slide 4: Family Medical History - Mr. X's father died at age 75 due to stroke. - His mother died at age 82 due to natural causes. - His older brother (72 years old) has a pacemaker due to arrhythmias. - No known hereditary diseases in the family.  Slide 5: Examination  - On examination  a pulsatile mass in the abdomen was noted. - Auscultation revealed a bruit over the abdominal mass. - Mild tenderness on deep palpation but no rebound tenderness.  Slide 6: Investigations and Diagnosis  - Ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5cm. - Chest X-ray and ECG were normal  with no signs of any pulmonary or cardiac disease.  Slide 7: Management and Outcome  - Due to size of aneurysm  Mr. X was referred to the vascular surgery department for elective repair surgery. - The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged with regular follow-ups.   Slide 8: Discussion  - This case highlights a classic presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a high-risk demographic profile: an elderly  Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and especially smoking  despite cessation. - In similar cases  early diagnosis and timely intervention can reduce the associated high mortality risk.   Slide 9: Conclusion - As medical professionals  we should maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA in elderly patients presenting with non-specific abdominal or back pain  especially in individuals with similar demographic profiles and risk factors as Mr. X.  Slide 10: References  (Here  you would include any references used to create the presentation.)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,2,"Title: A Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Male  Slide 1: Introduction and Demographics - Patient: 72-year-old Caucasian male - Occupation: Retired engineer - Lifestyle: Former smoker  moderate alcohol consumption - Family Medical History: Hypertension and coronary artery disease  This profile fits the typical demographic shown in literature for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  being more common in older age (60-85 years old)  males  and smokers or former smokers. Hypertension and family history are significant risk factors for AAA.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  - Hypertension for 10 years  managed with antihypertensive medication - Coronary artery disease diagnosed five years ago  treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) - Quit smoking a decade ago  after 30 years of pack/day smoking - Cholesterol levels routinely high; on statin therapy  These comorbidities signify an increased risk for the development of an AAA.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms - Patient presented with intermittent abdominal pain radiating to the back over past 6 months - Recent report of feeling a """"pulse"""" in the abdomen  The classic symptom triad for AAA includes abdominal pain  back pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass  though many AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture.  Slide 4: Clinical Evaluation - Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass - Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm - CT angiography showed an AAA with a maximal diameter of 5.7 cm  AAAs >5.5cm in males have a high risk of rupture  often indicated by sudden severe pain. Immediate management is indicated to avoid potentially fatal complications.   Slide 5: Treatment - Underwent successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  given the patient's age and comorbidities - Lifelong follow-up includes regular ultrasound evaluation to check for AAA size and potential leakage around stent  Slide 6: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of conscious demographic considerations  careful history taking and examination in the early detection and successful management of AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,3,Title: The Case of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Slide 1: Introduction -Case Introduction: Today  we present the case of a patient diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.  Slide 2: Demographics -Patient Personal Details: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian man  following the prevalent demographic for AAA diagnoses.  -Gender & Age: Data suggests 4 times more men are affected than women  most commonly between 65 and 75 years old. -Ethnicity: Globally  AAA is seen more frequently in Caucasian populations than African  Hispanic  or Asian populations.  Slide 3: Past Medical History -Smoking: The patient has a 30-year history of cigarette smoking  a significant risk factor for AAAs. -Cardiovascular disease: He also has a history of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. Both of these conditions increase the chance of an AAA. -Family history: He reports that his father died suddenly from an unknown cause at age 71  though AAA was suspected.  Slide 4: Symptoms & Detection -The patient has reported no symptoms  as is common for AAA. -The AAA was discovered as part of a routine check-up with the patient's primary care physician  using an abdominal ultrasound  further underpinning the value of regular screening in at-risk populations.  Slide 5: Diagnosis -The AAA was confirmed via a CT scan  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. This size is generally considered a threshold for surgical intervention due to an increased risk of rupture.  Slide 6: Conclusion -Case Summary: This case highlights the importance of routine screening for AAA  especially in high-risk populations such as males  over the age of 65  with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease. Early detection and prompt treatment offer the best chances for favorable outcomes.   Slide 7: Clinical Discussion -Discussion about the management options for AAA: open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). -The impact of patient's smoking habit on AAA and need for smoking cessation. -The importance of setting up regular surveillance for smaller AAA and reinforcing this practice. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,4,Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Slide 1: Introduction Objectives:  - Understand symptoms and demographic information - Discuss past medical history and correlations - Highlight the diagnosis and treatment options for abdominal aortic aneurysm  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Patient: Male  72 years old  Caucasian  retired construction worker  current smoker (30 pack-years)  occasional alcohol drinker.  Slide 3: Rationale Statistics have shown that Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) are most frequent in older Caucasian men  who are also smokers or former smokers.  Slide 4: Chief Complaint and Symptoms 1. Intermittent back pain for past six months 2. Recent unexplained weight loss and poor appetite 3. A sudden severe abdominal pain  lasting for a few hours  then subsided on its own 4. No report of chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  or dizziness  Slide 5: Past Medical History 1. History of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled with medication 2. History of hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 5 years ago  managed with diet and statins 3. No history of surgeries or current chronic diseases except as above  Slide 6: Literature-Based Connection A connection between hypertension  smoking  and AAAs has been established through literature. Those with hypertension experience weakened arterial walls  which combined with the damaging effects of tobacco on the vascular system  may lead to the development of AAAs.  Slide 7: Diagnostics Physical examination: Pulsatile abdominal mass upon palpation Doppler Ultrasound: Confirmed presence and size of the aneurysm CT scan: Further characterization of the aneurysm (location and extent)  Slide 8: Diagnosis The patient was diagnosed with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm based on clinical history  physical examination  and imaging studies.   Slide 9: Management and Discussion Management strategy depends on the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm  as well as patient's overall health status. In this case  due to the large size  surgical intervention (endovascular aneurysm repair) was recommended.  Slide 10: Conclusion Aging Caucasian men  particularly smokers with hypertension  represent a high-risk group for AAAs  so their screenings should be done very meticulously using ultrasound. Effectively managing hypertension and encouraging smoking cessation can help significantly reduce the risk and progression of an AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,6,Slide 1 – Introduction: We will be looking at a clinical case of a disease that significantly impacts the cardiovascular system: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is the third leading cause of instant death in men over the age of 60 in the western world after myocardial infarction and stroke.  Slide 2 - Demographics and Risk Factors: Most commonly  AAA affects older individuals  especially males over the age of 65  with men at a four to six times higher risk than women. AAA is strongly connected with a history of cigarette smoking  a higher prevalence in Caucasians than other ethnic groups  and a family history of the disease.  Slide 3 - Patient Profile: We present the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a retired schoolteacher with a 35-year history of cigarette smoking  and a family history of AAA (his father had an AAA caused death). He is hypertensive for the last 10 years and he has been managing it with diet  exercise  and medication.  Slide 4 - Presenting Concern: The patient presented with a vague  discomfort-type abdominal pain lasting for the past month. The pain did not radiate anywhere and did not have any associated symptoms.  Slide 5 - Diagnosis: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Considering his background  an AAA was suspected and an Ultrasound of the abdomen was ordered; it confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 5.5cm.  Slide 6 - Management and Follow-up: The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation. Given the size of the aneurysm and his symptomatology  the surgeon advised an elective repair with an endovascular stent.   Slide 7 – Prevention and Take Home Points: Quitting smoking  early detection through screening (especially in those with a family history)  management of hypertension and atherosclerosis are cornerstones for preventing AAA. Awareness of AAA as a potential cause for non-specific abdominal discomfort in at-risk patients can save lives by allowing for preemptive surgical intervention.  Slide 8 - Conclusion: In conclusion  the patient presented a classic case of AAA showcasing the importance of considering this disorder in male patients  with a history of smoking and hypertension  who present with vague abdominal discomfort. Prompt diagnosis and intervention decreased his risk for rupture and associated high mortality rate.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,7,Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: An Insight into Clinical Presentation  Diagnosis  and Management  Slide 1:  Introduction Meet Mr.Johnson  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer  residing in rural Texas. He presents to the ER complaining of severe  sudden onset lower back and abdominal pain.  Slide 2:  Demographics and Literature Background Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) primarily affects the population of 65 years and older and is more prevalent among males. Statistical data point towards the Caucasian population being more prone to AAA. Smoking history  male sex  and environmental factors play significant roles in AAA incidence.  Slide 3:  Past Medical History Mr. Johnson is a 40-pack-year smoker with controlled hypertension. He has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  another risk factor for AAA. There's no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Mr. Johnson has a past surgical history of appendectomy some 30 years ago.  Slide 4:  Detailed Symptoms Our patient presents with a sudden onset of intense pain in the lower back and abdomen  accompanied by pulsating sensations. He reports experiencing mild  constant discomfort in these areas over the past few weeks but didn’t seek medical attention then.  Slide 5:  Clinical Context – Ruptured AAA Mr. Johnson's symptoms match the classic presentation of a Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (rAAA). It is a condition that requires immediate medical intervention as it can be life-threatening.  Slide 6:  Diagnostic Strategies  Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged aorta of >3cm diameter  confirming suspicion of an AAA. A CT scan was immediately performed to further evaluate the extent of AAA  which confirmed that the aneurysm had ruptured.  Slide 7:  Intervention and Management  Mr. Johnson was promptly taken to the operating room for emergent surgical repair. Post-operative care included analgesia  anti-hypertensives and close monitoring in the ICU.  Slide 8:  Preventive Measures and Follow-up  In outpatient follow-up  patient was advised lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation  control of blood pressure  cholesterol-lowering medications and regular follow-ups with vascular surgeon for routine examinations.  Slide 9:  Summary  This case highlights the need for early detection of AAA  especially in susceptible demographics – older males with a history of smoking and PAD. Regular screenings for AAA can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates.   Slide 10:  Questions? Any questions on this case or AAA in general are welcome.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,8,"Title: Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Slide 1: Patient Demographics - This case study features """"Mr. James Garcia """" a 68-year-old Caucasian male who frequently visits the clinic due to cardiovascular-related issues. He is a retired school principal with a history of regular street food indulgences and a formerly high-stress occupation. His race and age are notably significant  as older Caucasian males tend to have a considerably higher risk of suffering from an AAA.  Slide 2: Patient's Social and Family History - Mr. Garcia is a widowed smoker who consumes alcohol moderately. He lives with his daughter's family  where he's minimally active. His father passed away from a stroke  while his mother died following complications from an AAA  indicating a possible genetic predisposition.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - Mr. Garcia has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease  which heightens his AAA risk. He underwent coronary bypass surgery 5 years back.  - Known allergic reactions: He's allergic to penicillin  which results in skin rashes.  Slide 4: Current Medical Issue & Symptoms - Mr. Garcia came in reporting abdominal pain that radiates to his back and scrotum. He described experiencing an unusual pulsating feeling in his abdomen. Further history revealed that he has been losing weight unintentionally and feeling lethargic for a month  which has never happened before.  Slide 5: Physical Exam & Diagnostic Tests - On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was appreciable. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed a 5.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  indicating the need for surgical intervention. - Laboratory tests: Elevated BP (145/90 mmHg)  LDL cholesterol levels above normal range  and stable kidney function.  Slide 6: Current Therapeutic Intervention - Due to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's history of coronary artery disease  Mr. Garcia was referred for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) after cardiology clearance. He is currently on medication for hypertension control (Lisinopril) and cholesterol reduction (Atorvastatin).  Slide 7: Discussion - This case study underscores the importance of raising awareness about AAA risks  particularly for individuals with certain risk factors  including positive family history  smoking  and advanced age. It also emphasizes the need for proactive approaches to management and patient counseling.   Slide 8: Conclusion & Future Recommendations - AAA is often asymptomatic until it's close to rupture. As a clinician  maintaining a high suspicion for AAA in patients with risk factors like Mr. Garcia can aid in early diagnosis. - As demonstrated in Mr. Garcia's case  broader application of screening protocol for AAA  especially for patients with significant risk factors  can significantly improve outcomes."

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,10,Title: Case Study - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  1. Patient Demographics: Patient pseudonym: Mr. Roberts. He is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. Recent studies suggest that AAA is more commonly found in Caucasian males over the age of 65.  2. Past Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both risk factors for AAA. In addition  he had been a heavy smoker for the past 40 years  another crucial risk factor related to development of AAA. His father passed away due to an unrecognized AAA rupture  thus there exists a familial predisposition. He has no history of diabetes or heart disease but has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.  3. Presentation History: He has been relatively asymptomatic  only mentioning vague lower back pain and sporadic abdominal discomfort. Most patients with an AAA are asymptomatic until rupture  so this highlights the importance of routine screening  particularly in the presence of familial history and other risk factors present in this case.  4. Diagnosis: A routine physical examination revealed an abnormal pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Further diagnostic tests  including ultrasonography confirmed an infrarenal AAA with a diameter of 5.5 cm  a size at which surgical intervention may need to be considered.   5. Management: Since his AAA meets the size criteria for surgical intervention  he has been referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation. Medication for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia has been revisited  with a heavy emphasis put on his smoking cessation and incorporating physical exercise into his lifestyle.  6. Prognostic Implications: AAA is a potentially life-threatening condition which can lead to uncontrolled bleeding and shock if it ruptures. Prognosis is dependent on prompt diagnosis and management. In Mr Roberts' case  his prognosis can significantly improve if he opts for the suggested surgery and improves his lifestyle habits.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of routine physical examination and vigilance  especially in patients with multiple risk factors. A high degree of suspicion  when combined with effective patient communication and careful clinical examination  represents a critical pathway in the successful identification and management of AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,19,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Case Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 2: Patient Demographics and Past MMedical History - Patient: Caucasian Male  aged 65 - Occupation: Retired teacher - Lifestyle Factors: History of 45 years of smoking - Past Medical History: Hypertension for past 15 years managed with medication. This demographic and lifestyle data is in line with statistics that suggest males  especially those above 60  with a history of smoking and hypertension  have a higher risk factor for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA).  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms - Patient presented with an increasing  pulsating feeling in his abdomen - Slight lower back pain reported - No significant weight loss or changes in appetite. Please note: These symptoms are not always indicative of an AAA; a physical exam and imaging tests are required for a definitive diagnosis.  Slide 4: Physical Exam - Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in abdomen. - No signs of inflammation or tenderness were observed.  Slide 5: Diagnostics - Patient underwent both ultrasound and CT scan. - Imaging confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  approximately 5.5cm in diameter.  Slide 6: Treatment and Prognosis  - Due to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's associated risk factors  surgical intervention was recommended. - Open repair surgery was deemed more suitable than endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  considering the aneurysm's shape and location. - Post-operative period was uneventful  and the patient is now recovering well with regular follow-ups planned.  Slide 7: Prevention and Risk Management - Educating patient about smoking cessation and maintaining good blood pressure control. - Encouraging regular monitoring and imaging for early detection of aneurysms in at-risk patients. - Recommending routine physical check-ups and good lifestyle habits.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case provides a typical representation of an AAA patient  emphasizing the importance of considering risk factors  early diagnosis  and timely medical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,20,Title: A Case Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are prevalent among older adults and can lead to severe complications if left untreated. Understanding the demographics and medical history of a typical AAA patient can help practitioners identify this condition early and effectively manage it.  Slide 2: Patient Details  Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male retired from working in construction  presents to the clinic with persistent and significant lower back pain. He is a smoker  consuming about half-a-pack per day in the last four decades. He also has a history of hypertension that has been managed with medication for the past ten years.  Slide 3: Literature on Demographics  The literature states that Caucasians are at a significant risk of developing AAA. Predominantly affecting the older population(Age >60)  AAA has a male predisposition  with a male to female ratio as high as 6:1. Smoking  hypertension  and certain occupations requiring heavy lifting like construction  lead to an increased risk of AAA.  Slide 4: Previous Medical History  Mr. Smith's past medical history reports chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  attributed to his cigarette smoking. He also has a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. His family history is significant for heart disease  including his father who died of AAA rupture.  Slide 5: Current Presentation  The intensity of Mr. Smith's back pain is 7/10 and is not relieved with over-the-counter medications. A concerning symptom report is the feeling of a pulse in his abdomen  a symptom commonly associated with AAA.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests  Based on his demographic profile  risk factors  and symptoms  a detailed physical examination and ultrasonography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of AAA. Due to his age  smoking patterns  and family history  he is considered at high risk.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Risk factors like old age  male gender  Caucasian race  smoking habits  hypertension  family history of AAA  and certain occupational patterns make Mr. Smith a typical representative of an AAA patient. Early identification and appropriate management can prevent life-threatening complications in such patients.   Slide 8: Discussion & Questions  Opportunity for attendees to ask questions about the case and discuss early diagnosis and management of AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,24,Title: Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction Text: The focus of our case study is on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  an often asymptomatic vascular disease that can turn life-threatening if not diligently monitored.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Text: The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian male. Though the disease can affect anyone  AAA is most common amongst Caucasian men aged 65 or older.  Slide 3: Patient Background Text: The patient has a history of smoking  a risk factor associated with AAA. He smoked 2 packs daily for 40 years (80 pack years total). While he quit smoking ten years ago  the potential damage to his aorta remains.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Text: The patient has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. Both conditions increase the risk of AAA and add to the complexity of the case. Concurrent medical history includes atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease.  Slide 5: Symptom Presentation Text: The patient came in due to sudden and severe pain in his lower back and abdominal region. The pain was associated with a pulsatile mass in the abdomen and symptoms of hypotension  indicative of possible aneurysm rupture.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Details Text: An immediate CT scan confirmed the presence of the AAA. The aorta diameter measured 6 cm  indicating a large aneurysm prone to rupture.  Slide 7: Next Steps and Treatment Plan Text: Given the large size of the aneurysm and signs of rupture  emergency surgery was the strategic treatment plan. The patient underwent endovascular aortic repair.  Slide 8: Conclusion Text: AAA represents a substantial risk due to its potential for asymptomatic progression and deadly consequences if undetected or untreated. Comprehensive monitoring is key  particularly for patients over 65 with a history of smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerosis.  Slide 9: Questions and Discussion Text: Now that we've reviewed this case  let's discuss how early detection strategies  understanding risk factors  and patient education can improve outcomes for patients with AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,25,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction - Patient X  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents at our facility with incidences of recurring pain in his lower back and abdomen.  Slide 2: Demographics - According to literature  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) more commonly affects men aged 65 and over  especially among the Caucasian population. Our patient's demographic factors align with these findings. Recent studies show that the incidence of AAA in men is four times higher than in women.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - Patient X has a long history of chronic hypertension and has been a smoker for over 50 years  both of which are strong risk factors for AAA. - In addition  the patient has high cholesterol levels  a condition associated with an increased risk of AAA. - Patient X's father was diagnosed with an AAA at age 70  which suggests a possible genetic component.  Slide 4: Current Presentation - The patient has reported severe  sudden pain in his abdomen and lower back  suggestive of a potentially ruptured AAA. - He also experiences occasional lightheadedness and an increased heart rate  symptomatic of internal bleeding.  Slide 5: Preliminary Diagnosis - Based on the patient's symptoms  risk factors  and family history  our preliminary diagnosis is a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Plan - We plan to perform an abdominal ultrasound  which is the most common test for diagnosing AAA.  - If the ultrasound confirms our suspicions  we'll proceed with a CT scan to ascertain the size and condition of the aneurysm  which will facilitate effective treatment planning.  Slide 7: Treatment Options - If the AAA is small and not causing symptoms  we'll monitor it closely and advocate for lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and blood pressure management. - If the AAA is large or rapidly increasing in size  surgery will be necessary to prevent rupture. This may involve endovascular surgery or open surgery to repair the aneurysm.  Slide 8: Patient Education - We'll educate the patient and his family about the condition  its risks  the importance of early detection  and the role of lifestyle changes in managing AAA.  Slide 9: Conclusion - The prompt management of this case showcases the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention in managing patients with AAA  a potentially life-threatening condition mainly affecting men in their later years.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,26,"Slide 1: Introduction to Case Meet Mr. Robert  a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with abdominal  back  and groin pain that has persisted for a few days. According to the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are most prevalent in Caucasians  and this condition is four times more common in males older than 60.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. Robert has a history of long-term smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerosis - all significant risk factors for the development of an AAA. He has no known drug allergies. In addition  he has familial history of AAA as his father had a ruptured AAA at 76 years of age.  Slide 3: Significance of Patient's History The incidence of AAA is strongly associated with advanced age  male sex  tobacco usage  and a family history of the condition. Concurrent conditions such as hypertension and atherosclerosis can compromise vascular integrity and increases his likelihood of developing an AAA.  Slide 4: Symptoms & Physical Examination  Mr. Robert reported constant  severe pain that he described as """"tearing"""" in nature. He also reported feeling a pulsating mass in his abdomen that corresponds with his heartbeat. On physical examination  an abdominal mass was palpable and pulsatile along with hypertension and elevated heart rate.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests An ultrasound was performed that revealed an aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. CT Angiography confirmed an infrarenal AAA with no signs of rupture.   Slide 6: Discussion In conclusion  extra care should be taken due to Mr. Robert's age  family history and lifestyle factors such as long-term smoking. Management can involve surgical intervention due to size of aneurysm and presence of symptoms indicative of impending rupture  and post-operational management for his hypertension and smoking cessation counseling. Remember  timely diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,30,**Slide 1: Patient Demographics**  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 68-year-old African-American male with a past medical history relevant for smoking (30 pack-years)  chronic hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. It's essential to note that according to epidemiologic data  men and especially African-American ethnicity are at higher risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  and the mean age at diagnosis is around 70 years.   **Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms**  Mr. Smith presented with constant  severe pain in his lower back and abdominal area  which he described as a tearing sensation. The pain  which was not relieved by painkillers  has been worsening steadily over the past 24 hours. This fits with literature  as most AAA cases present due to rupture  which brings severe  unrelenting pain.  **Slide 3: Past Medical History**  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been managing it with prescription medication. He is also being treated for hyperlipidemia  diagnosed three years ago. However  he has a significant history of smoking  a considered risk factor for AAA.   **Slide 4: Physical Examination**  On examination  Mr. Smith was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass and he was in obvious distress due to pain. His blood pressure was elevated and he was tachycardic. Brisk  symmetric peripheral pulses were present on examination.  **Slide 5: Diagnostic Measures**  An ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of a 6.5cm AAA  indicating high risk of rupture. A B-mode ultrasound demonstrated evidence of an AAA with an aortic diameter of >3 cm  with additional AAA wall irregularities evincing possible imminent rupture risk.  **Slide 6: Treatment**  Mr. Smith was immediately scheduled for emergency surgery  which is the standard treatment for ruptured AAA and typically consists of open aortic repair or endovascular aneurysm repair  depending on the patient’s overall clinical status and anatomical suitability.  **Slide 7: Conclusion**  Physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA  particularly in older patients with risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The case of Mr. Smith underscores the critical role of rapid diagnosis and intervention to improve survival outcomes in patients with AAA.

Studies indicate that approximately 8% of men over the age of 65  particularly Caucasian men  develop AAA  and smoking is one of the primary risk factors.  Slide 3: Medical History  Duration: 2 minutes  Narration: Mr. X has a history of hypertension and atherosclerosis  which have remained relatively stable over the last few years managed by medication. His family history also includes vascular disease  as his father suffered an aortic aneurysm at the age of 75.   Slide 4: Current Presentation  Duration: 2 minutes  Narration: Mr. X presented with vague constant abdominal pain  which he stated had been occurring over the last week. On examination  a pulsatile mass was found in the epigastric region  causing suspicion for an AAA.  Slide 5: Diagnosis & Treatment  Duration: 3 minutes  Narration: Upon conducting an abdominal ultrasound  a 5.6 cm infrarenal aneurysm was identified. Given his demographics  history  and the size of the aneurysm  Mr. X was referred for immediate endovascular repair  which is less invasive and has a lower 30-day mortality rate compared to an open repair surgery.  Slide 6: Prognosis & Education  Duration: 2 minutes  Narration: Post-operation  Mr. X is expected to have a satisfactory recovery given successful intervention before rupture. He's advised to quit smoking and maintain a healthy diet to manage his atherosclerosis and hypertension  thus lowering his risk of future aneurysm.  Slide 7: Conclusions  Duration: 2 minutes  Narration: This case emphasizes the importance of understanding risk factors for AAA in elderly Caucasian males  particularly smokers with a history of vascular disease. Improved patient education on smoking cessation and its impact on vascular health could be beneficial.  Slide 8: Questions & Discussion   Duration: Until end of session  Narration: Now  let’s open the floor for questions and discussion on comprehensive management of AAA  focusing on our current case.

Introduction My case discussion revolves around a patient diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   II. Patient Demographics/Past Medical History Let's call our patient Mr. Smith. He is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  living in a suburban setting and is retired from corporate work.   Past medical history is significant for: - Hypertension: Managed with a combination of diuretics and beta-blockers for the past 15 years. - Smoking: 50 pack-years history  quit 10 years ago. - Hyperlipidemia: Managed with statin therapy. - Family history: Father died of an AAA rupture at 72.  III. AAA Patient Profile Consistent with Literature The demographics and medical history of Mr. Smith align with a typical patient suffering from AAA according to the literature. Research indicates that AAA is more prevalent in Caucasian males aged 65 and above  especially those with a history of smoking and hypertension. Family history also plays a significant role in AAA prevalence.  IV. Presentation and Diagnosis Mr. Smith presented with an episodic abdominal pain radiating to his low back for the last three months  initially thought to be merely digestive troubles. On examination  a pulsatile mass was felt in the abdomen. A follow-up ultrasound confirmed a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  V. Discussion The AAA size in Mr. Smith  in combination with his age and family history  puts him at a significant risk of rupture.   VI. Management Plan He was referred for an elective Open Aortic Repair (OAR). He also receives continued medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  along with lifestyle modifications like a low sodium diet and daily exercise  as well as mental health support to help him deal with the diagnosis.  VII. Conclusion  This case study allows us to understand the typical demographic and medical history of a patient prone to AAA  reinforcing preventative measures like smoking cessation  blood pressure control  and the role of early diagnosis in the effective management of this life-threatening condition.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,40,Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm    Slide 1: Introduction Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular condition characterized by a localized dilation of the aorta  typically affecting elderly men.   Slide 2: Patient Characteristics   Our case study focuses on Mr. J  a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a pulsating mass in his abdomen identified during a regular physical check-up.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr. J is a retired teacher  a heavy smoker for over 50 years. His medical history reveals hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There is no family history of AAA. His BMI is 28  and he leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 4: Presentation and Symptoms   Up to this point  Mr. J had been asymptomatic  which is consistent with many AAA cases. Occasionally  he experienced abdominal and lower back discomfort  which he attributed to aging.   Slide 5: Diagnosis   An abdominal ultrasound confirmed a 6 cm AAA  leading to a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) for further understanding.   Slide 6: Risk Factors and Demographics   AAA is significantly linked to age  male sex  smoking  and a history of vascular disease. Most prevalent in men over 65  it tends to affect more Caucasians than any other racial or ethnic group. It’s important to note that despite Mr. J’s lack of family history  having a first-degree relative with AAA increases the risk.  Slide 7: Treatment and Prognosis   Once the aneurysm reaches 5.5 cm or more  or if it grows quickly  surgery is usually recommended. Mr. J underwent an endovascular repair with successful results. Lifestyle modification  including smoking cessation and exercise  is essential to prevent disease progression.  Slide 8: Conclusion   Being aware of AAA risk factors and symptoms  although they may be non-specific or absent  can significantly impact early diagnosis and management. The role of medical practitioners in educating patients  particularly those who match the demographic profile of Mr. J  is crucial.   Reference: - De Rango P  Cao P  Simonte G  et al.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,41,Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Demographics and Patient Profile Our patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and smoking. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases strongly with age  and it is significantly higher in males  Caucasians  and smokers.   Slide 2: Past Medical History Our patient was previously diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  managed with lifestyle changes and statin therapy. He was also a heavy smoker  having a 50-year pack history before cessation 5 years ago. Both these factors significantly increase his risk of atherosclerotic disease and consequent development of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Slide 3: Presenting Complaints Patient reports experiencing vague  intermittent lower back and abdominal pain over the past few months. The pain is non-radiating and is not associated with meals  bowel movements  or exercise.    Slide 4: Physical Examination  Physical examination reveals a pulsating mass in the abdomen slightly above the navel. The mass was tender on deep palpation  and an audible bruit could be heard on auscultation. No other apparent abnormalities were observed.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring 5.3 cm in maximum diameter. Further investigations including complete blood count  lipid profile  and renal function tests were ordered to assess his overall health status and suitability for potential surgical intervention.  Slide 6: Management and Plan Given the size and characteristics of the abdominal aortic aneurysm  combined with the patient's symptoms  surgical intervention - either open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair - is a consideration. Continued lipid management and anti-hypertensives will be vital elements to manage his overall cardiovascular risk.  Slide 7: Patient Education Educating the patient about the risks  possible complications  and lifestyle modifications will be integral to the management plan. This should include emphasizing the importance of diligent adherence to medication regimen  eating a heart-healthy diet  exercising regularly  and maintaining regular follow-up appointments.   Slide 8: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of considering aortic aneurysm in older patients  especially with a history of smoking and hyperlipidemia  presenting with vague abdominal or lower back pain. Early recognition and management can significantly reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  from a middle-class socio-economic background.   Slide 3: Prevalence in Demographics AAA predominantly affects the older age group  more common in males and has a higher prevalence among the Caucasian population.  Slide 4: Patient Medical History Our patient is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history  has a long-standing history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia. Family history reveals that his father died due to a ruptured aneurysm  suggesting a potential genetic predisposition.  Slide 5: Past Medical Interventions Past medical records involve treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia with antihypertensive drugs and statins respectively. Despite these interventions  reports suggest poorly regulated blood pressure levels.  Slide 6: Current Presentation The patient recently experienced intermittent  severe abdominal and lower back pain  occasional lightheadedness  and an unexplained rapid pulse.   Slide 7: AAA Risk Factors in the Patient It is important to note the presence of several AAA risk factors in the patient: age over 60  male sex  smoking history  high blood pressure  and family history of AAA.  Slide 8: Diagnosis and Imaging A physical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the abdomen  leading to a presumptive AAA diagnosis. This was confirmed with a subsequent Abdominal Ultrasound showing an enlarged aorta.  Slide 9: Treatment and Recommendations Given the size of the aneurysm and the presence of symptoms  surgical intervention is recommended. The patient will undergo an Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Post-surgical follow-up and lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and better control of hypertension are crucial.  Slide 10: Conclusion Reviewing this case elevates the importance of considering AAA in differential diagnosis when patients present with vague abdominal or lower back pain  especially in high-risk demographics. Timely intervention can significantly reduce the fatal complications associated with AAA rupture.   References: Provide pertinent references here
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,43,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a dilatation of the aorta  typically defined when the diameter exceeds 3 cm or more. As per various clinical studies  AAA is prevalent in older Caucasian males with cardiovascular risk factors like high blood pressure and smoking.  Slide 2: Patient Profile  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with complaints of pulsating sensation in the abdominal area and consistent low back pain. The patient is a retired office worker  doesn't follow any routine physical exercise  and has a 40-year history of smoking.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,47,Presentation Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Slide 1: Introduction  Case introduction highlighting a 70-year-old Caucasian male with suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) due to non-specific symptoms such as lower back pain and pulsating sensation in the abdomen. This presentation is in line with reported statistics showing AAA is mostly prevalent in Caucasian males aged 65-75 years.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient's medical history includes hypertension and atherosclerosis. His non-medical history reveals a 40-year history of smoking  which considerably increases risk for AAA. Neither the patient’s immediate family members have history of AAA  reducing his genetic predisposition.  Slide 3: Clinical Manifestations  The patient presented to the hospital with persistent stomach and back pain and a noticeable pulsating feeling near his navel. He also reported episodes of syncope  which can be a sign of ruptured aneurysm.  Slide 4: Diagnosis  The patient underwent a physical examination where a pulsating mass in the abdomen was palpated. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm measuring approx. 5.5 cm in diameter.  Slide 5: Management Given the size of the aneurysm  surgery has been recommended for the patient. Open repair surgery or endovascular repair are options being considered. Stringent monitoring will be maintained in the post-operative phase to check for any complications.  Slide 6: Patient Education  Educating the patient on the need to quit smoking  maintain a healthy lifestyle and adhere to prescribed medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol in order to minimize future risks.  Slide 7: Conclusion  AAA prevalence is higher in older  Caucasian males  especially those with a smoking history and cardiovascular diseases. Early detection is key to enable surgical intervention before rupture. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,48,Title: A Case Study of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)   Slide 1: Patient Overview  Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  reflecting the higher incidence rate of AAA in this demographic according to literature. He's a former heavy smoker  a major risk factor for AAA. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been associated with an increased risk of AAA. He lives alone and is usually active and independent.  Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented with several hours of gradually worsening mid-abdominal pain radiating to the back and occasional lightheadedness. He denies any recent trauma  change in bowel habits  hematuria  or nausea/vomiting.   Slide 3: Clinical Examination  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass about 5 cm in diameter was detected in his central abdomen. He has no signs of shock  but appears mildly uncomfortable with the abdominal pain. Abdominal auscultation also revealed a vague bruit over the mass.  Slide 4: Diagnostic Results  Bedside ultrasound demonstrated an AAA measuring 5.3 cm with possible evidence of leak. A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis  showing a 5.3 cm infrarenal AAA with signs of underlying rupture.  Slide 5: Management   The patient was immediately admitted to the vascular surgery department for monitoring and emergent repair. They opted for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Postoperative recovery was uneventful.   Slide 6: Follow-up and Outcome  Follow-up CT scans over the next 6 months showed no sign of endoleak and the patient reported no further abdominal pain or discomfort. He was additionally counseled on smoking cessation and better control of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia to prevent the progression or development of another AAA.  Slide 7: Conclusion   This case highlights the demographic and risk factors for AAA  the importance of early recognition given its high mortality rate once ruptured  and the effectiveness of EVAR as treatment. Complete vascular assessment and aggressive management of vascular risk factors are both key to preventing and treating AAA. Regular follow-up and patient education can improve the prognosis significantly.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,57,Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)   Slide 1: Introduction Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is a localized enlargement of the lower part of the aorta  the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. When the aorta is at its normal size  its diameter is usually around 2.0 cm. However  when there's an aneurysm  the aorta may expand to more than 3.0 cm.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient in the case study  Mr. T  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer residing in Michigan. Demographically  AAA is more commonly diagnosed in older adults  age 65 or more  and is prevalent within Caucasian males. It's also significant to mention that AAA is observed to occur four to five times more often in males than in females.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. T is a smoker for about 40 years and has a history of high blood pressure  high cholesterol  and peripheral arterial disease. He consumes alcohol in moderation. Family history reveals his father died at 80 years due to an unknown heart condition. AAA is associated with smoking and other cardiovascular diseases. A positive family history for AAA also poses a significant risk factor.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms \ Mr. T visited his primary care physician complaining of intermittent abdominal and back pain  a common symptom associated with AAA. The pain intensity varies  sometimes sharp  sometimes dull.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation Upon clinical examination  a pulsating mass was palpable in the abdominal region. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA  measuring 4.5cm in diameter.   Slide 6: Management  Current management includes close observation and lifestyle modification  such as cessation of smoking  dietary changes to control high cholesterol and blood pressure  and regular exercise as tolerated. A surgical consult has been made as surgery is usually advised for AAA larger than 5.5 cm or rapidly growing aneurysms.   Concluding Slide: Importance of Awareness This case underscores the need for awareness about AAA amongst older  male  smoking patients  particularly with a history of cardiovascular conditions and a positive family history. Proper screening in these high-risk patients is important as AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture  which can have fatal consequences. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,58,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Clinical Synopsis   Slide 1: Introduction ------------------------------------- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological dilation of the abdominal aorta  often due to atherosclerosis and degenerative changes. It is more commonly found in males over the age of 60. Risk factors include smoking  hypertension  familial history  and Caucasian ethnicity.  Slide 2: Patient Profile  ------------------------------------- Mr. Stevens  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  walked into the ER complaining of constant  severe abdominal and back pain. He's a former smoker  quit 10 years ago after a 30-year history of smoking. He's been managing hypertension for 15 years. His father passed away from “a burst blood vessel in the abdomen” at 72.  Slide 3: Past medical history ----------------------------------------------- Mr. Stevens has a documented medical history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypertension. He is also being treated for hyperlipidemia. His medications include enalapril  atorvastatin  and albuterol as needed for COPD.  Slide 4: Physical examination findings ------------------------------------------------- On examination  he was hemodynamically stable  with a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass. On auscultation  a bruit was heard over the abdomen.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Management ------------------------------------------------ The patient underwent a CT angiography which revealed a large 7-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm  warranting immediate surgical intervention. Given his overall physical status  he was referred to the vascular surgery team for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure.   Slide 6: Postoperative Follow-Up ------------------------------------------- The patient will need close monitoring postoperatively  focusing on blood pressure management  wound care  and monitoring for signs of infection or aneurysm leakage.  Slide 7: Conclusion -------------------------------- AAA poses a serious public health issue  posing considerable risk of rupture and death if it goes undetected. Given the relatively high prevalence in older Caucasian males  especially smokers  careful monitoring and preventative strategies are crucial. It is vital for clinicians to consider AAA in differential diagnosis in patients presenting with abdominal or back pain and risk factors.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,61,Title: Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Older Caucasian Male  Slide 1: Introduction Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with vague abdominal and lower back discomfort of a few weeks’ duration.  Demographics fit the pattern for highest risk as per literature  which states that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) occur most often in Caucasian men aged 65 and older.    Slide 2: Past Medical History Past medical history reveals patient is a former smoker with hypertension. He is being treated with antihypertensive medication. He has no history of diabetes  but have a family history of AAA. The relevance of these factors are substantiated by literature stating hypertension  tobacco use and family history as potent contributors towards AAA.  Slide 3: Symptoms Presentation Patient describes the discomfort as a dull ache which sometimes radiates to his lower back and groin. He also mentions occasional lightheadedness. The lack of acute severe pain indicates possibility of a slowly expanding aneurysm rather than a rapidly growing or rupturing one.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination Examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Auscultation over the mass revealed bruit. No abdominal rebound  tenderness or guarding was found.     Slide 5: Diagnosis Due to patient’s age  medical history and physical findings  a working diagnosis of AAA is suspected. To confirm  an abdominal ultrasound is performed which revealed a 5.5cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm  thus establishing the diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.  Slide 6: Management Given the size of AAA  we recommend prompt surgical consultation for planning of elective repair to prevent rupture. Endovascular versus open surgical repair should be discussed taking into account the patient’s overall health status  surgical risk  and life expectancy. Goal-directed therapy for hypertension and smoking cessation counseling is advised at this stage.  Slide 7: Conclusion This patient’s case represents a typical demographic prone to AAA and underlines the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion in older  hypertensive male patients  particularly those with a family history of AAA or a palpable abdominal mass.  Slide 8: Learning Points Review symptoms of AAA  which may be vague and non-specific. Understand the critical role of medical history and physical examination in the diagnosis. Discuss importance of early identification and risk factor management to improve patient outcomes.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,65,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  - Briefly discuss Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) – A condition characterized by localized enlargement of the lower part of the aorta that generally causes no symptoms until rupture.   Slide 2: Patient’s Demographics  - Patient X is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. According to the literature  AAA is more common in men as compared to women  with the frequency increasing with age. The percentage of white individuals affected by AAA is relatively higher than that of the Black  Hispanic  or Asian population.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   - Patient X has a smoking history of 45 years  supporting literature that indicates smoking is a strong risk factor for AAA. - He has history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and hypertension. Research shows that these are common comorbid conditions found in patients with AAA.  - Family history reveals his father died of a ruptured AAA. The risk of AAA increases if a first-degree relative has had an aneurysm.  Slide 4: Current Medical Status   - Patient X presented with a palpable pulsating mass in the abdomen and unexplained lower back pain.   Slide 5: Diagnosis   - Ultrasound confirms diagnosis of a 6 cm infra-renal AAA. Large AAA (>5.5 cm) is an indication for surgical repair.  Slide 6: Treatment   - Discuss suitable treatment options such as Open Aneurysm Repair (OAR) or Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR).  Slide 7: Prognosis and Follow-up  - With appropriate treatment  prognosis may be favorable. However  patient will need careful lifelong monitoring given the chances of post-operative complications or aneurysm recurrence.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,66,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta. It tends to be more prevalent in men  the elderly  and among those with a family history of AAA or other cardiovascular diseases. Let's consider a case that is represented frequently in associated literature.  Slide 2: Demographic Presentation  The patient  Mr. X  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired mechanical engineer and a lifetime smoker. Lives with his wife in the suburbs and is an active member of his community.  Slide 3: Relevant Family History  Patient's father died of a ruptured AAA at the age of 65. His elder brother of 75 recently had an uncomplicated endovascular repair of an AAA. No other family members are known to have AAA.  Slide 4: Personal Medical History   Known medical history includes hypertension controlled by medication for the past 20 years  hyperlipidemia with statin therapy  and a 50-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking last year after being diagnosed with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No other significant surgical or medical history.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms   Patient has been asymptomatic  the AAA was incidentally detected during an abdominal ultrasound for gallstones six months ago. His AAA has since been monitored with surveillance ultrasonography. His last scan  done a week ago  showed that his aneurysm has grown to 5.5cm in diameter.  Slide 6: Treatment Evaluation  Given recent ultrasound findings  surgery will be evaluated as a potential option. Open repair and endovascular aneurysm repair are both potential procedures. Mr. X's age  relevant comorbidities  and family history will be taken into account in deciding the best course of treatment.  Slide 7: Conclusion   This case is representative of the typical patient with AAA according to demographic prevalence and risk factors in the literature. The patient is a high-risk individual with significant factors such as age  smoking history  and family history. The decision for surgical intervention will be a balance of the risk of rupture against the risk of surgery. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,67,Title: A Case Study of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or swelling in the aorta  the main blood vessel that runs from the heart down through the chest and stomach. Today we present the case of a 70-year-old male patient with AAA.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. Statistical data from the Society for Vascular Surgery places male Caucasians above the age of 65 at the highest risk for developing AAAs. This link is even more profound among those who have ever smoked or have a family history of aneurysm.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History Our patient is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history  quit 10 years ago. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both conditions are being managed by medication. He also has a familial history of AAA which further increases his risk.  Slide 4: Symptoms and Diagnosis  The patient came in with persistent back pain and a physical examination revealed a pulsating mass in his abdomen. A follow-up abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large AAA; it measured 5.5 cm in diameter.   Slide 5: Treatment and Management An endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was carried out as his AAA exceeded the 5.4 cm diameter threshold for endovascular repair. This is a less invasive option as compared to open surgery and usually preferred for high-risk patients.  Slide 6: Post Operation  The patient's recovery was uneventful. Medications for his blood pressure and cholesterol levels were adjusted  and he is undergoing routine monitoring and consultation.   Slide 7: Conclusion AAA is a potentially life-threatening condition especially if it ruptures. The patient in this case was fortunate to have his AAA discovered before it ruptured. This case underscores the necessity of regular health screening among high-risk groups.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,68,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: A Case Study of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  smoker for the past 50 years  1 pack per day. Previous occupation was as an auto mechanic. He is overweight with a BMI of 30. The patient demographic reflects data showing that abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) most commonly affects older Caucasians  with males having 4-5 times greater risk than females  those with a history of smoking and having a higher body mass index.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia – conditions often associated with AAA. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 10 years ago. Other than these  no known allergies or other significant past surgical history. No family history of AAA.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint   The patient presents with a one-day history of severe  tearing abdominal pain that radiates to his back. He has also experienced a recent  unexplained weight loss and decrease in appetite.   Slide 5: Clinical Examination  On examination  his blood pressure was 150/95 mm Hg  pulse 90 beats per minute. There's a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass which is tender on deep palpitation. However  no evidence of lower limb ischemia or abdominal bruit.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Findings   Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 6 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A subsequent CT scan confirmed this diagnosis and provided more detail. The CT scan showed that the aneurysm begins below the renal arteries and extends into the common iliac arteries bilaterally.   Slide 7: Management  Considering the size of the patient's aneurysm and his symptoms  emergent surgical repair was strongly recommended. An open surgical procedure or an endovascular procedure will be chosen based on the patient’s risk factor assessment.   Slide 8: Discussion  AAA rupture is a high-risk emergency with a 90% mortality rate upon occurrence  which can be prevented with early diagnosis and elective surgery. Thus  routine screenings should be done for high-risk patients such as men aged over 65 years with a history of smoking.   Slide 9: Conclusion  The case underlines the significance of routine screenings and the impact of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and BMI control  in preventing the development of AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,69,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Clinical Case Overview: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 2: Demographics Patient Profile: John. S  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with lower back discomfort for a few weeks now. Literature shows that about 85% of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur in males  particularly in their sixties or older  and Caucasians are at higher risk.  Slide 3: Past Medical History John has a 30-year history of smoking  reporting a pack-a-day habit until quitting five years ago. He has hypertension  which has been controlled on medication for approximately 10 years. John has been also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  and early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  both common risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Slide 4: Earlier Medical Interventions He also had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) around six years ago. He has been on low-dose aspirin since his TIA event and uses inhalers for managing his COPD symptoms.  Slide 5: Family History His father passed away from an aneurysm rupture in his mid-seventies. One of his brothers  aged 72  had a successful surgical intervention for a thoracic aortic aneurysm two years ago.  Slide 6: Current Clinical Presentation John initially reported occasional dull aches  somewhere between the navel and lower back regions. More recently  he complained of a constant  throbbing sensation in that same location. He also mentioned mild dizziness upon standing  which subsided after resting.  Slide 7: Further Examination and Diagnosis Based on John’s medical history  symptoms  and risk factors  he was referred to a vascular surgeon. Further diagnostic imaging confirms the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  with a diameter of approximately 5.6 cm  which suggests an urgent need for intervention.   Final Slide: Conclusion We have presented a case study of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a high-risk demographic group. Early recognition and management are essential to prevent devastating consequences associated with rupture. Regular checkups and monitoring of at-risk patients should be emphasized.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,71,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction: This is a presentation of a case  designed to give a comprehensive understanding of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) to foster learning and discussion in the medical community. AAA is a pathological enlargement of the abdominal aorta  exposing patients to the risk of aneurysm rupture  which is often fatal.  Case Presentation:  Demographics: Mr. MJ  a 72-year-old Caucasian man  presented to the office during a routine check-up. He was born  raised  and resides in an urban community. He is a retiree  previously working in construction  and is a smoker with a 50-pack-year history. His family history includes paternal lineage with cardiovascular disease. He is widowed and lives alone.   Relevant Medical History: Mr. MJ has Hypertension  diagnosed at the age of 50  and moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD). He previously underwent coronary angioplasty a decade ago.  Presenting Issue: Mr. MJ came in for a routine check-up  during which he stated experiencing mild  intermittent abdominal pain for the past three months. He also reported unintentional weight loss but denied fever  chills  or night sweats.  Physical Examination: His vitals were stable; BP - 140/90 mmHg  Pulse - 70 bpm  regular. Auscultation revealed a bruit in the periumbilical area. No palpable mass was noted due to patient's body habitus.   Provisional Diagnosis: Given the age  sex  smoking history  and the symptom of unexplained abdominal pain  a provisional diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm was considered.  Investigations: An abdominal ultrasonography was recommended  which revealed a 5.5 cm dilated infra-renal aorta  confirming the diagnosis of AAA.  Discussion: The risk factors for AAA include advanced age  male sex  smoking  Caucasian descent  family history of AAA  and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Mr. MJ’s clinical presentation of unexplained abdominal pain  the audibility of abdominal bruit  age above 60  male gender  history of smoking and hypertension all increased his risk for AAA.  Conclusion: The case presentation has been an in-depth look into the symptomology  risk factors  diagnostic approach  and implications of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  detailing the prevailing demographic predilections and comorbidities associated with the condition. Further discussions should involve appropriate referrals  management strategies  and patient education. Hence  prevention  early detection  and timely intervention are critical in managing AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,72,Title: A Case Study on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  I. Introduction  A middle-aged Caucasian male  aged 69  presents with intermittent  vague lower back pain and occasional abdominal discomfort for the past few weeks. He denies any specific injury or triggering events.   II. Demographics & Past Medical History  Demographics: This patient falls into the most common demographic for AAA which is individuals over the age of 65  specifically white males. The American Heart Association affirms Caucasians are more susceptible to AAA than other races  with the prevalence highest in older men of 60 to 85 years.  Past Medical History: He has a reasonably significant medical history  including: - Smoking: The patient admits to a 40-year history of smoking  which contributes remarkably to AAA's likelihood due to the nicotine's detrimental effects on the blood vessels. His smoking history places him higher at risk  as AAA occurs approximately five times more frequently in smokers. - Hypertension: He is a known case of hypertension and has been on antihypertensives for the past ten years. This is relevant due to blood pressure's physical impact on arterial walls. - High cholesterol: The patient has been on statin therapy for years  and lipid disorders contribute to the development of atherosclerosis  predisposing to aneurysms. - Family history of AAA: His father and grandfather both had AAA  suggesting a likely genetic component.    III. Clinical Presentation  He gleans no relief from over-the-counter pain medication  and recently noted a pulsatile feeling in his abdomen. However  the patient has no other symptoms such as fever  weight loss  loss of appetite or urinary complaints. The physical examination is remarkable for a pulsatile abdominal mass.  IV. Diagnosis  Sudden lower back pain and an abdominal mass in this patient's demographic group should raise a high suspicion for an AAA. Ultrasonography would be ordered for his presenting symptoms  and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan would confirm AAA’s diagnosis.   V. Conclusion  In conclusion  this case underlines the importance of detailed history taking  especially concerning risk factors such as age  race  gender  smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and familial history for diagnosing AAA. This presentation aims to instigate a discussion about AAA’s epidemiology  pathophysiology  risk factors  diagnosis  and management.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,74,Slide 1: Introduction  This presentation details a case study of a patient with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). AAAs are commonly found in males aged 65 and above  especially among Caucasians. Each year  it's estimated that 200 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with it.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male retiree. As per literature  AAA occurs most commonly in this demographic. He lives with his wife and has two adult children.  Slide 3: Risk Factors & Past Medical History   Mr. Smith is an ex-smoker  ceasing habit 5 years ago after 40 years of smoking  a significant risk factor for AAA. He is also moderately overweight and has a sedentary lifestyle. He has a history of controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Mr. Smith's father passed away at 75 from a ruptured AAA  highlighting a genetic predisposition to the condition.  Slide 4: Symptoms & Diagnosis  Mr. Smith was asymptomatic  typical for AAA. His AAA was discovered during an abdominal ultrasound for an unrelated complaint. The ultrasound revealed an infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 5.2cm  indicating an AAA.  Slide 5: Treatment Plan  Management of Mr. Smith's AAA depends on size & symptoms. Given that it measures just over 5cm  we've recommended surveillance via ultrasound every 6 months. He's been advised to maintain blood pressure and cholesterol levels  lose weight  and increase physical activities. If the aneurysm increases to 5.5cm or more or develops symptoms  intervention may be considered  including endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair.  Slide 6: Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of AAA awareness among at-risk populations. Early detection is key as most AAAs are asymptomatic. Lifestyle adjustments and regular monitoring are crucial to prevent aneurysm growth and possible rupture.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,81,Title: A Case Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction Today we'll examine the case of a patient diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm - an enlarged area in the lower part of the aorta. Understanding the demographics  past medical history  and overall health contributes significantly to outcomes and management strategies.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case concerns a 68-year-old Caucasian male  accurately representing a demographic often affected by the condition. According to literature  men aged over 65 are at the highest risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms  with Caucasians being five times more likely to develop this disease.  Slide 3: Other Demographic Factors The patient was a smoker for over 30 years and consumed alcohol moderately  heightening the risk factor. Socio-economically  the patient is retired and belongs to the middle-income class. Despite having quit smoking five years ago  he has accumulated potential cardiovascular risks due to his smoking history.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has a notable history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and hypertension. Both these conditions have significantly contributed to the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm due to the increased stress placed on the arterial walls. His family history also revealed that his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm  underlining a potential genetic predisposition.  Slide 5: Previous Diagnostic Imaging and Surgical History This patient underwent a cholecystectomy fifteen years ago  but there were no diagnostic imaging suggestive of an aneurysm at that time. His PAD diagnosis  done three years back  would have prompted regular abdominal ultrasounds  which initially identified the aneurysm.  Slide 6: Clinical Presentation The patient initially presented with a vague discomfort in the lower abdomen. With aneurysm growth  the discomfort increased  radiating to the back  thus prompting a visit to the doctor. The physical exam revealed a palpable mass in the middle and upper part of the abdomen.  Slide 7: Conclusion Given the past medical history  demographic profile  and current symptoms  the medical team pursued further investigations to determine the severity of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. Early detection and surgical intervention are critical to avoid complications  such as rupture  emphasizing the importance of routine exams in high-risk populations.

His medications include a daily aspirin  lisinopril  atorvastatin  and intermittent nitroglycerin for chest discomfort. He has no known drug allergies.  Slide 4: Symptom Presentation John was experiencing abdominal pain  occasionally radiating to his back. He reported no fever  loss of weight or appetite. However  he has observed an alarming increase in the intensity of pain over the past two months.  Slide 5: Clinical Findings  On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Upon auscultation  a bruit was heard over the mass. The physical examination findings aligned with the typical presentation of an AAA - usually asymptomatic until rupture  at which point severe pain is most commonly experienced.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests  An abdominal ultrasound was carried out  which confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. He was immediately referred to the vascular surgery department.  Slide 7: Treatment and Follow-up  John was scheduled for an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  a less invasive surgical procedure that decreases mortality and morbidity when compared to open surgical repair. He was also slated for pharmacotherapy to treat his other vascular conditions and modify risk factors to improve his overall prognosis.  Slide 8: Conclusion In conclusion  late diagnosis of AAA can lead to severe medical emergencies owing to its asymptomatic nature. Prompt diagnosis through regular checks for high-risk individuals could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality. John's case demonstrates the need for surveillance  appropriate referral  and treatment in patients with an AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,84,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction Today we'll be discussing a hypothetical patient experiencing an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. With approximately 200 000 cases diagnosed in the United States annually  this condition is a significant medical concern often associated with a high mortality rate if ruptured.   Slide 2: Demographics Our patient  Mr. Jones  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. This falls right within the typical demographic for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  as the condition is most commonly seen in males over 65 years of age. There's a higher prevalence noted among Caucasians compared to other ethnic groups.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Jones is a former smoker  having smoked for 40 years before quitting ten years ago. He also has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. His father suffered a ruptured AAA at the age of 75  which puts Mr. Jones at familial risk.   Slide 4: Current Complaint Mr. Jones reports a dull  heavy sensation in his lower abdomen that has persisted for several weeks. He has not seen any visible or palpable abnormality  but the discomfort has made him feel unease. He reports no acute pain  backache  or issues with urination or bowel movements.   Slide 5: Importance of Past Medical History Consider Mr. Jones's past medical history in line with known risk factors for AAA. Aging  male sex  smoking  high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  and family history of AAA fit his profile  showing the importance of taking a detailed past medical history in clinical context.  Slide 6: Conclusion In light of Mr. Jones's demographic profile  past medical history  and current complaint  AAA should be a significant consideration. Despite the lack of acute symptoms  the dull pain and high-risk profile suggest that potential AAA needs to be ruled out swiftly through relevant diagnostic measures. It highlights how an understanding of certain demographic trends and risk factors can aid in the diagnosis of important conditions like AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,85,Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction - Age ≥ 65 years  white male as Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are most common in this demographic group. - Occupation: Retired Mechanical Engineer. - Location: Living in an urban city in the Midwest USA.  Slide 2: Past Medical History - Hypertension: Chronic  well-managed with Lisinopril for the past 10 years. - Hyperlipidemia: Managed with Statin Therapy. - Former smoker: 30-pack year history  but successfully quit smoking 5 years ago. - No history of Diabetes Mellitus or any other chronic illnesses. - Father died from a ruptured AAA at 70  thus positive family history.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaint  - Symptom-free: AAA was detected incidentally when the patient underwent an investigation for another non-related condition. Alternatively  it could be a health check-up as central and peripheral arterial diseases have asymptomatic periods. - Or atypical symptoms: FDA suggests older patients often produce important symptoms that are incorrectly dismissed as signs of aging.   Slide 4: Examination Findings -Presumably fit and asymptomatic  vital signs within a normal range as most AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture. - Palpable  pulsatile abdominal mass upon physical examination.  Slide 5: Investigations  - Abdominal ultrasound confirming a 5.6 cm infrarenal AAA. AAAs >5.5cm  especially in patients over 65  are typically considered for surgical evaluation  due to the increased risk of rupture.  Slide 6: Management - Refer to a vascular surgeon: A consensus assuming AAA >5.5cm in case of men and >5.2cm in case of women. - Risk factor modification: Continue anti-hypertensive management  lipid-lowering therapy. - Consider psychological support if needed.  Slide 7: Conclusion - Screening and early detection of AAA are critical  especially in high-risk populations. - Risk factor modification  and in suitable candidates  surgical intervention  can prevent the serious consequence of AAA rupture.

AAAs are most common in men over the age of 65 and those with a history of heart disease or smoking.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Patient: Mr. J.K.  a 72-year-old Caucasian male who is a former heavy smoker.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. J.K. has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  and coronary artery disease for which he underwent angioplasty five years ago. He quit smoking five years ago  but had 40 pack years history prior to quitting.   Slide 4: Presentation Mr. J.K. presents with mild to moderate lower back pain and vague abdominal discomfort. Given his demographic profile  medical history  and potential AAA symptoms  a high suspicion for AAA is warranted.  Slide 5: Screening and Diagnosis Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) confirmed an infrarenal AAA of 5.5 cm diameter.  Slide 6: Management  Considering the size and the presence of symptoms  surgical intervention is the appropriate next step  either through open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The decision requires thorough discussion with Mr. J.K.  taking his general health status and personal preference into consideration.  Slide 7: Prevention and Monitoring Post-operatively  Mr. J.K. will require regular follow-up and imaging to monitor the surgical repair. Encouragement of continued smoking cessation  control of blood pressure and cholesterol  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are pivotal to decreasing the risk of aneurysm growth and rupture.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,91,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Slide 1: Introduction Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  a degenerative condition  pertains to a localized enlargement of the lower section of the aorta. It primarily affects the elderly population and is more prevalent among males. The presentation focuses on a typical AAA patient  Mr. John  a 74-year-old Caucasian male.  Slide 2: Demographics  According to the literature  AAA predominantly affects males aged 65 and older. Additionally  it has been reported that AAA is more common among the Caucasian populace. Our patient  Mr. John  falls within this most affected demographic.  Slide 3: Lifestyle Factors  Mr. John has a history of smoking  a significant risk factor linked with AAA. He also has a moderate alcohol intake and has a inactive lifestyle  both of which also contribute towards AAA prevalence.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Mr. John has a documented record of hypertension and high cholesterol levels  which have been under medication for the past ten years. Both these conditions could potentially contribute to the weakening of the arterial wall  thereby precipitating AAA. No significant family history of AAA has been recorded.  Slide 5: Presenting Complaints and Symptoms Mr. John presented with a palpable pulsating mass in his abdomen and occasional abdominal discomfort for the past six months. However  he does not show any signs of the most feared complication  i.e.  rupture  like severe back or abdominal pain  shock symptoms  and sudden decrease in hematocrit levels.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Investigation Upon physical examination and ultrasound imaging  a 5.5cm aneurysm was detected below the renal arteries. Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis  offering a more precise aneurysm measurement and its relation to renal arteries.  Slide 7: Management and Follow-up Due to the size of Mr. John's AAA  surgical intervention was recommended. The less invasive Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) was performed successfully. Mr. John will be closely monitored through regular follow-up visits and ultrasound scans every six months.  Slide 8: Conclusion Early detection and vigilant management are key when dealing with AAA. Understanding risk factors  associated demographic profile  and educating patients about lifestyle changes can significantly contribute to AAA management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,92,Title: A Case Study of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): Balancing Interplay between Demographics and Medical History  Slide 1: Introduction: Highlighted in this presentation is a hypothetical case study of Mr. Jack  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Statistically  AAA is common among Caucasian men over the age of 65  due to factors such as genetics and lifestyle.  Slide 2: Demographics: Mr. Jack was a life-long heavy smoker but quit 10 years ago in his early 60s. His BMI is 28  placing him in the overweight category. He has a history of moderate alcohol intake but stated that he has made some efforts in limiting alcohol. The prevalence of AAA in populations is influenced by risk factors such as age  smoking  obesity  ethnicity  and a history of vascular disease. Most mentions are seen in Caucasians  smokers  and individuals between the ages of 65 and 75.  Slide 3: Past Medical History: Mr. Jack's medical history reveals he is hypertensive and has been undergoing treatment for the last 15 years. He has a history of Hyperlipidemia but has been managing it via statin medication for over a decade. There is also a history of coronary artery disease in his lineage  with both his father and grandfather dying from heart attacks in their 70s. In his mid-60s  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease but has managed to largely control it via drug therapy and lifestyle modifications.  Slide 4: Diagnosis of AAA: Mr. Jack was asymptomatic but was discovered to have an AAA during an ultrasound scan for his routine screening. Regular screenings are essential for individuals above the age of 65  particularly those with a history of smoking or cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 5: Management: Initially  management will center on watchful waiting  as his AAA was small (3.1 cm). His hypertension and hyperlipidemia will continue to be managed with appropriate medications; lifestyle modifications to improve his BMI will be suggested  as will continued adherence to the smoking cessation. His case will be reviewed periodically to screen for any enlargement of the aneurysm.  Slide 6: Conclusion: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms based on factors such as demographics and medical history are crucial in early detection  management  and would be an invaluable tool to prevent rupture. Health educators need to focus on the susceptible demographics in order to promote lifestyle modifications and appropriate screenings.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,99,"Title: Case Study - Understanding  Diagnosing  and Managing Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  I. Introduction   Patient Profile:  Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  with a height of 5'6"""" and weight 82kg  retired construction worker living in urban Nevada  presents the case today.   Reason for visit:  The patient attended a routine health check-up  complaining of on-and-off abdominal discomfort accompanied by lower back pain.  II. Demographics and Past Medical History   Demographics:  By literature  AAA is more pervasive in males and individuals aged over 65 years  predominantly found in Caucasian ethnicity  which corresponds to our patient’s profile. It is more common in Western countries  accounting for approximately 1 in every 50 deaths in older men.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is a former smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking 10 years ago. The patient has a medical history of essential hypertension managed with ACE inhibitors  hypercholesterolemia managed on statins  and peripheral arteriosclerosis. He also has a family history of AAA  as his father was diagnosed in his late sixties.   III. Clinical Presentation  The patient reported occasional abdominal discomfort and sporadic lower back pain lasting a couple of hours  usually relieved by rest. He denied any fever  chills  weight loss  or changes in bowel movements.   IV. Diagnosis   Physical Examination:  Upon initial examination  a pulsating abdominal mass was palpable.   Investigations:  Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed  revealing an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm  thus confirming the diagnosis of AAA.  V. Management and Prognosis   Since the aneurysm diameter is >5.5 cm  surgical intervention by endovascular aneurysm repair is indicated to prevent rupture.   Prognosis depends on the size of the aneurysm  speed of its growth  risk factors such as hypertension and smoking status  and age.   VI. Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for AAA in older  Caucasian males with a history of peripheral arteriosclerosis and familial history of AAA  to facilitate prompt detection and management and prevent fatal complications.   Educating patients  especially those at risk  about AAA will also assist in early diagnosis and potential life-saving interventions.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,3,100,Title: A Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Slide 1: Introduction  - Brief overview of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) - Explanation of the relevance to demographic representation  Slide 2: Case Identification  - Subject: Male  Caucasian  Age 70 - Reason for such demographics: According to the American Heart Association  AAAs are most common in white males and the risk increases with age. While AAAs can occur in women and other races as well  more than 60% of cases are reported in white males  especially over the age of 65.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - Patient is a former smoker - Patient has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol - Family history of aneurysm (Research shows that smoking  hypertension  and family history significantly increase the risk of AAA)  Slide 4: Presentation - Patient presented with vague  uncomfortable feeling in the abdomen and lower back pain - No visible or palpable mass observed - No signs of rupture  such as intense abdominal pain  low blood pressure  rapid pulse  or loss of consciousness   Slide 5: Diagnosis  - AAA suspected based on age  medical history and symptoms  - Confirmed with ultrasound imaging showing enlarged aorta  (The Society for Vascular Surgery states that ultrasound has 95% sensitivity in diagnosing AAA)  Slide 6: Treatment  - Since the patient’s AAA is over 5.5cm  open surgical repair recommended to avoid rupture  (Note: If diagnosed early and the AAA is small  regular monitoring and lifestyle changes may be sufficient until the AAA is large enough to require surgery)  Slide 7: Conclusion  - Emphasize the importance of being aware of risk factors for AAA  particularly in older  white male patients with a history of smoking  hypertension  and family history of aneurysms.  - Highlight the potential for silent progression of AAA and thus the importance of screening in at-risk populations - Emphasize the effectiveness of surgical intervention in preventing life-threatening ruptures when diagnosed at later stages.

The pain radiates to the groin and abdomen. The patient also reports faintness and nausea. Personal medical history is positive for a 30 pack-year smoking history and 10-year history of hypertension  which has been inconsistively treated. The patient reports no previous diagnosis of any vascular disease.   On examination  the patient appears pale and diaphoretic. Palpating the abdomen in the midline just above the umbilicus  a pulsatile mass is appreciated. The patient's blood pressure is 90 over 60 with a heart rate of 110 bpm. This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggesting an acute rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,2,Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male   Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  peripheral artery disease  and a ≥30 pack-year smoking history. He also has a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Presenting Complaints/Symptoms:  The patient came in with occasional  uncharacteristic back pain and feeling of pulse in the abdominal region. The pain had been waxing and waning  but has become gradually more intense over the past few weeks. Recent worsening of his symptoms prompted him to seek medical attention. As part of his ongoing management for his hypertension  he undergoes regular blood pressure checks and it has typically been well controlled with medication. He also reported unintended weight loss and decreased appetite.  Given his age  history of smoking  family history  peripheral artery disease  and presenting symptoms  there is a high level of clinical suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic imaging is advised.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,95,A 71-year-old Caucasian male presents with constant  severe abdominal and lower back pain. The patient reports his pain began suddenly  approximately three hours ago. He characterizes his pain as a pulsating feeling in his abdomen. On a pain scale  he rates it an 8 out of 10. No recent trauma is reported.   Critical demographic information reveals that our patient is a former smoker  reporting 30 pack-years of tobacco use. He has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and peripheral artery disease  of which all are managed with appropriate medication. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father dying of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his older brother recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   He presented to the emergency department due to the severity and suddenness of onset of this lower abdominal and back pain. He also reports feeling lightheaded earlier but denies any instance of syncope  chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination  a pulsatile mass can be palpated within his abdomen. Vital signs are concerning for mild tachycardia and hypotension.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,96,Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  previous smoker with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  who presents with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back. His pain is described as a tearing sensation and rated as a 9 out of 10 in intensity. Patient also reports feelings of nausea and light-headedness. On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass can be palpitated. Given the age group  male gender  Caucasian descent  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of smoking  and the presentation of sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain  the symptoms raise a high suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,97,A 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and smoking presents with severe  constant pain in his lower back and abdomen. He reports feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen along with unexplained weight loss over the past 3 weeks. His history reveals that he has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years and has been poorly compliant with his antihypertensive medications.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,98,A 70-year-old male  with a long-standing history of smoking and hypertension  presents with complaints of severe  constant abdominal and back pain that started suddenly a few hours ago. The pain  which initially began in the abdominal region  has radiated to his back and he describes it as 'tearing'. Patient also reports feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  although he denies any incidence of syncope  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea or constipation. Family history is significant for aortic aneurysm in his father. On clinical examination  there is a prominent pulsatile abdominal mass. The abdomen is tender on palpation  especially around the area of the mass. Patient is tachycardic and hypertensive.   This male patient aligns with the high-risk population for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which prominently occurs in males who are over 65 and have a history of long-term smoking and hypertension. His symptoms of sudden  severe pain  associated with a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass  are consistent with AAA rupture  a life-threatening medical situation that needs urgent surgical intervention. His father's history of having an aortic aneurysm is significant and contributes to the high risk given the genetic factor associated with AAAs.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,5,99,A 70-year-old Caucasian male  lifetime smoker with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease  presents with severe  tearing lower back pain of sudden onset  radiating to the abdomen. Additionally  the patient reports weakness in both legs and light-headedness. He has a history of regular alcohol consumption and high-cholesterol diet intake. His father died of complications related to aortic aneurysm. On examination  he has a pulsatile mass in the abdomen and a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg.

He maintains a moderate alcohol intake of about two drinks per week. He used to be a corporate employee and is now retired. He stays urban with his wife and has two children. His family history is remarkable for cardiovascular disease (his father died of myocardial infarction at an age of 72 and his brother has hypertension).  Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with intermittent abdominal pain  especially after meals  which has been ongoing for the past few weeks. The pain seems unrelated to physical exertion. He also reports nausea  occasional vomiting  feeling of fullness  and weight loss. He has noted changes in bowel habits with an increased frequency of constipation. On palpation  there is a pulsatile abdominal mass.  Past Medical History: The patient has had a past history of hypertension  which was diagnosed 15 years back. He is currently on antihypertensive medications (Lisinopril and Amlodipine). He also had a history of elevated cholesterol levels  controlled with statin therapy. Other than that  there is no history of any chronic diseases like diabetes  COPD  or kidney diseases. He had an appendectomy in his twenties and generally enjoys stable health with no significant illness in recent past.  Possible Diagnosis: Considering the patient's age  history of smoking  hypertension and high cholesterol  as well as the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass  a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may be suspected.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,2,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   - Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old  Caucasian male  - Past occupation: Long-haul truck driver  - Current daily smoker (~15 cigarettes/day)  - Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29  indicating borderline obesity - History of hypertension  which has been treated for the past 10 years  - Has high cholesterol levels - Has a history of coronary artery disease - Family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm   Problems:  Mr. Johnson initially presents with an incidental finding of a pulsatile mass in his abdominal area during a regular visit for his hypertension condition. He reported infrequent vague abdominal discomfort and lower back pain but thought it was due to his old age and obesity. No history of severe or sudden-onset back or abdominal pain  flank pain  or symptoms suggesting hypovolemic shock or syncope.  Examination:  - Pulsating abdominal mass palpable on physical examination  - Heightened systolic blood pressure at 155/90 mmHg  - No sign of distended veins in the legs  but exhibited slight loss of hair in lower extremities - No strong abdominal tenderness  rebound  or guarding during examination  Diagnostic Tests:  - Subsequent ultrasonography showed a dilated infra-renal aorta of approximately 5.5 cm in diameter confirming the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. - Hematologic results are generally normal  - No signs of renal insufficiency or elevated creatinine - Electrocardiogram reveals nonspecific changes   Impression:  Based on his age  gender  smoking history  cholesterol level  hypertension  and family history  Mr. Johnson is at high risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The palpable mass and ultrasound results confirm the diagnosis. Given the size of the aneurysm  Mr. Johnson is at risk of rupture and will require surgical intervention. He will need smoking cessation intervention  dietary modification  and additional pharmacotherapy to control his existing risk factors.  Plan:  - Refer the patient to a vascular surgeon for surgical consultation. - Initiate protocols for smoking cessation and develop a diet plan to reduce cholesterol. - Improve hypertension control by adjusting antihypertensive medication. - Repeat ultrasound in 6 months if surgery is not immediately pursued (postoperatively if it is) to monitor aortic size. - Instruct patient to return to the ER if he experiences sudden  severe abdominal or back pain.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,3,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  A 69-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint:  Pain in the abdomen and lower back  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been a smoker for over 40 years. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father died of a heart attack at 60-years old.   Signs and Symptoms:  The patient reports sudden severe pain in his lower back and the middle of the abdomen  which is constant and does not fluctuate. Additional reported symptoms include light-headedness and cold  sweaty skin.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass can be detected in the abdomen. The patient also has high blood pressure and an elevated heart rate.  Diagnostic Tests:  Blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers. An ultrasound of the abdomen and computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirm the presence of a 7cm aortic aneurysm.  Problem:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  Background:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common in males over 65 years old  white race  smokers  those with a family history of AAA  and those with history of other cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The most common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm are smoking  hypertension  and family history of AAA. The patient's age  gender  race  past medical history  and presentation are consistent with a typical patient presenting with abdominal aortic aneurysm. In this patient  the AAA is large and symptomatic  which elevates the risk for rupture and is an indication for immediate therapeutic intervention.  Relevant History:  - Hypertension  - Hyperlipidemia  - Tobacco use (44 pack-years) - Family History of cardiovascular disease - Patient is symptomatic with pain  Physical Exam Findings:  - Pulsatile Abdominal Mass - High Blood Pressure - Elevated heart rate  Test Results: - Elevated inflammatory markers in blood tests - 7cm Aortic aneurysm on ultrasound and CTA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,4,"Problem Representation:  Patient Description: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named John  retired. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history. He was a heavy drinker in his 40s but has refrained from excessive alcohol intake for the past two decades. John has been diagnosed with high blood pressure  mild obesity (BMI: 30 kg/m2)  and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been taking medication - a calcium channel blocker for his high blood pressure and a statin for high cholesterol. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease  particularly his father  who suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. He claims to be moderately physically active through daily walks and gardening.  Clinical Presentation: John has presented to the clinic for a routine health checkup. He has been experiencing episodic lower back pain from the past few weeks  previously attributing it to """"old age"""" and """"gardening."""" He also mentions a feeling of fullness in his abdomen  but no significant weight loss  changes in appetite  or symptoms of gastrointestinal distress. He measured his blood pressure at home  which read higher than usual  even with the ongoing medication.  Clinical Findings: On abdominal examination  there is a pulsatile mass in the center of the abdomen. His blood pressure is slightly above the treatment goal (150/95 mm Hg). Cardiovascular examination is normal  but bruits are heard on auscultation over the abdomen. Lower extremity pulses are palpable and equal bilaterally. No other significant findings are reported during the physical examination.  Diagnostic Impression: The clinical context and the physical examination suggest the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Consequently  further diagnostic investigations like ultrasonography or CT angiography would be beneficial in confirming the diagnosis and discussing potential therapeutic interventions.  From demographic and clinical standpoints  John is typical of patients at risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is known that the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms is higher among older Caucasian males  particularly those with hypertension  a family history of aneurysms or cardiovascular disease  a history of smoking  and high cholesterol levels."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,5,Problem Representation:  Demographics: Patient Alpha is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a socioeconomic status within the lower-middle-class range. He lives in a suburban neighborhood. Patient Alpha is a former 40+ year smoker  having quit smoking about six years ago  but he maintains a moderate alcohol intake and has a sporadic physical exercise routine. He's a retired construction worker and lives with his wife.  Past Medical History: Patient Alpha has a significant medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and atherosclerosis. His hypertension has been controlled using prescribed medications for the last decade  and his atherosclerosis was diagnosed seven years ago. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including a father who died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in his late 70s. Patient Alpha's cholesterol levels are controlled using medication  but his compliance with the regimen is occasionally lax. His diet is high in saturated fats and sodium  and he is overweight with a BMI of 28.      Additionally  the patient had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to his prolonged history of smoking but the condition has experienced significant improvement since he quit smoking.   Presentation: Currently  he is presenting with occasional mid-to-lower back pain and vague abdominal discomfort  which he initially attributed to old age and his former occupation. During his last regular checkup  his primary care physician detected a pulsatile mass in the abdominal area leading to suspicion about an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which is quite common in individuals with his demographic and medical profile. Given his family history  there is a high index of suspicion and a need for additional investigation.   Psychosocial Factors: Patient Alpha shows signs of anxiety relating to his health  based on his family's history of health complications and his own past health issues. Patient Alpha is predominantly cared for by his wife and occasionally relies on state-provided healthcare services for the uninsured/underinsured.  Therefore  based on the demographics  past medical history  and current presentation  there is a high suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further imaging tests (i.e. abdominal ultrasound or CT scan) are planned to confirm the diagnosis.+  The risk factors identified from the literature that aligns with this patient's profile are age over 65  male gender  Caucasian race  smoking history  hypertension  family history of abdominal aortic aneurisms  high cholesterol levels  and atherosclerosis. The psychosocial factors suitable for this profile include limited physical activity  anxiety related to health  lower socioeconomic status  and non-compliance with medication regimens. It's also important to note that being overweight and having a diet high in saturated fats and sodium can contribute to the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,6,Problem Representation:  Patient  Caucasian male  aged 70 years  presents with complaints of pulsating feeling in the belly  a constant deep pain on the side of the abdomen  and lower back pain that has been persistent for the last few weeks.   Demographics:  - Sex: Male - Age: 70 years old - Race: Caucasian  - Marital Status: Married  - Occupation: Retired (former manual laborer) - Location: Lives in urban area - Insurance: Medicare   Medical History:  His medical history shows that he has been a heavy smoker for more than 50 years. The patient reports alcoholic intake regularly but moderately. He has controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture when he was around the same age. The patient also has a 10-year history of coronary artery disease  for which he underwent bypass surgery. He also underwent an appendectomy in his forties.   The patient has been having general practitioners' regular check-ups but has never been screened for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His medication regime includes aspirin  beta-blockers  and statins. There is a complaint of recent unintentional weight loss  but he denies having any fever or changes in bowel or urinary habits.  Risk Factors:  The major risk factors present include age over 65  male gender  history of smoking  and hypertensive. There also appears to be a potential genetic risk factor given his father's history of an AAA rupture. His past medical history  including coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia  also puts him at increased risk.  Conclusion:  Given the patient's age  smoking history  family history  and presenting symptoms  an abdominal aortic aneurysm should be highly suspected. A full cardiovascular examination and ultrasound imaging should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the size and location of the aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,7,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male patient presents to the clinic with a bulging sensation in his abdomen.  Relevant Demographics:  The patient is a retired truck driver  residing in a suburban community with his wife. He is a former smoker  having quit smoking 15 years ago but had a 30-pack-year history of smoking. He is mostly sedentary  and his BMI falls in the overweight category. He reports moderate alcohol consumption and does not have a history of drug misuse.  Presenting Complaint: The patient is experiencing discomfort and a sense of fullness in his lower abdomen. He sometimes feels a pulsating sensation in his belly but is not consistently present.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of peripheral artery disease and hypertension  both controlled through medications. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) approximately ten years ago  attributed to his smoking history. He stopped smoking after COPD diagnosis. He has not been diagnosed with any relevant genetic diseases.  Family Medical History: The patient's father died at the age of 76 due to aneurysm rupture  and his brother  aged 78  has a known small abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Social History: The patient lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver. He is retired and spends most of his time at home  with little physical activity. He quit smoking 15 years ago but had previously been a heavy smoker. He admits to occasional alcohol usage but denies any illicit drug use.   On Examination: Physical examinations reveal an abdominal mass that pulses with the patient's heartbeat. On auscultation  a bruit was heard over the mass.   Summary: This 72-year-old former smoker with a history of peripheral arterial disorder  hypertension  and COPD presents with symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) characterized by an abdominal mass and pulsations. This patient's risk factors include his age  male gender  positive family history  and previous projects of COPD  which suggests a higher risk for AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,8,Patient Profile:  Sex: Male Age: 70 years old Race: Caucasian Residence: Urban area Smoking Status: Smoker (40 pack-year history) History of disease: Hypertension for 10 years  Patient Presentation:  Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) typically present with:  - Usually asymptomatic and detected by chance during medical examinations. - If symptomatic  the patient might report persistent and intense abdominal and/or lower back pain.  - If the aneurysm ruptures  there can be a sudden onset of extreme  tearing abdominal and/or lower back pain  which can radiate to the groin  buttocks or legs. There may also be associated symptoms like dizziness  fainting or rapid heart rate  indicating a possible life-threatening emergency.  Past medical history:  1. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been treated for over a decade. Hypertension can cause progressive dilatation or weakening of aortic walls  contributing to the development of AAA.  2. Smoking: The patient has a long history of heavy smoking. Tobacco use is known to be strongly associated with AAA  presumably due to its damage to blood vessels.  3. Family history: The patient has a brother who underwent surgery for AAA at 67 years old. Having a first-degree relative with AAA increases this patient's risk.  Demographic:  This patient's profile is typical of AAA patients. He is 70  which places him in the typical age group  as AAA mostly affects those aged 65 and older. Men are more likely to develop AAA compared to women. This patient is a Caucasian  another demographic that has the highest incidence of AAA. He also lives in an urban area and urban dwelling is associated with a higher risk of AAA.  This representation encapsulates both the patient's individual risk factors and the typical demographic characteristics of AAA patients. It blends together individual and population-level data to create an accurate and holistic depiction of a patient with AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,9,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. James is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who has presented with consistent lower back pain and occasional abdominal pain over the past couple of weeks. He recently also experienced feelings of fullness after eating small meals. His family informed us that he has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels and is an active smoker with a 30-pack year history. He once experienced brief loss of consciousness two years ago but didn't have any serious follow-up at the time. There is a known family history of vascular disease  especially with his father who had died from rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 70.   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension 2. High cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia) 3. 30 pack-year history of smoking 4. Brief Transient Ischemic Attack manifested as loss of consciousness two years ago 5. Family history of vascular disease and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm   Current Complaint: Lower back pain  occasional abdominal pain  and postprandial fullness  This is a plausible representation of a typical patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Literature suggests that risk factors for AAA include advanced age (generally older than 60)  smoking history  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  and having a family history of AAA. The symptoms presented like persistent back pain  abdominal pain  and feeling full quickly are often associated with AAA  especially if it is large or leaking. However  many AAAs do not cause symptoms unless they leak or rupture.   Note: An Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) often develops over years and is frequently asymptomatic until an acute event such as rupture occurs  which requires emergency surgery and associated with high mortality. Therefore  the diagnosis is often made either incidentally during medical imaging or during screening of high-risk individuals. The absence of direct symptoms makes it even a bigger latent danger.

His family history reveals his father and grandfather also suffered from cardiovascular diseases and died due to related complications. His BMI is 28  indicating he is overweight  and follows a diet that is high on unhealthy fats and low on fiber. He used to be an occasional drinker  consuming alcoholic beverages once a week.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels a decade ago. He has been prescribed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs  however  he is not very diligent about taking these medications. He had a stroke two years ago from which he fully recovered after a period of rehabilitation. He was diagnosed with claudication five years ago and has been managing this condition with changes in lifestyle and medication. The patient also suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his long history of smoking  and he uses inhalers for symptom control.  Presenting Complaint:  Recently  he has been experiencing frequent abdominal pain and back pain  especially after meals. He also reports a sense of a pulsating mass in his abdomen. There had been no recent change in his weight  appetite or bowel habit.  A thorough physical examination  history exploration and perhaps an immediate CT scan would be suggested to confirm the abdominal aortic aneurysm suspected based on the presenting complaint and the risk factors present in the patient.   Note: The represented demographic characteristics are based on statistical data which suggest that abdominal aortic aneurysms are more prevalent in older males  particularly those with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol levels and somewhat more prevalent in the white population. However  abdominal aortic aneurysms can affect anyone.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,12,Patient Case Representation:  Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 70 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired  - Lifestyle: Smoking history of 40 pack-years  Presenting Complaint: - Consistent  severe abdominal pain - Mild lower back pain  Past Medical History: - Heart disease - Hypertension - High cholesterol - History of stroke  Family History: - Father had abdominal aortic aneurysm - Mother had hypertension  Social History: - Smoker – 40 pack-years - Occasional alcohol consumption - Sedentary lifestyle  Physical Examination: - Palpable pulse in the abdomen - Hypertensive   Diagnostic Tests: - Abdominal ultrasound revealing a 5.5 cm dilation of the abdominal aorta  This demographic and medical history accurately represent the typical patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm as found in literature. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are most common in males  with a high prevalence in those over the age of 65. Caucasians are at higher risk compared to other ethnicities. Risk factors for AAA include smoking  hypertension  and a family history of the condition. Conditions such as heart disease and high cholesterol also contribute to the development of AAA. Abdominal or back pain are common symptoms  and physical examination may reveal a palpable pulse in the abdomen. The diagnosis is usually confirmed through the use of abdominal ultrasound.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,13,Problem Representation:  1. Patient Demographics:    - Age: 73 years old    - Sex: Male     - Race: Caucasian    - Occupation: Retired office worker    - Living Situation: Lives with spouse    - Geographic Area: Urban    - Habits: Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago)  drinks alcohol moderately  limited physical activity.  2. Chief Complain:    - Visiting for routine health check-up  yet occasionally experiences an unexplained mild abdominal and lower back pain.  3. Past Medical History:    - Hypertension: Diagnosed 17 years ago  taking antihypertensive medication.    - High cholesterol: Diagnosed 15 years ago  controlled with diet and statin therapy.    - Mild obesity: BMI 28 (weight: 85 kg/height: 1.7 m)  4. Family Medical History:    - Father died of a stroke in his late 70s.    - Mother has type 2 diabetes.  5. No drug allergy.  6. Current Medications:     - Amlodipine 10 mg daily for hypertension    - Atorvastatin 20 mg daily for high cholesterol   According to literature  the highest incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) occurs in Caucasian males aged 65-75. Risk factors include smoking  atherosclerosis (which can be inferred from the history of hypertension and high cholesterol)  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Observe that AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture occurs  it can also present as abdominal or back pains which are common complaints of this target demographic.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,14,Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. John Doe  Age: 72 years old  Gender: Male  Race: White   Demographics: Mr. Doe is a retired construction worker who has been living in Nebraska  United States. He has been a heavy smoker for 30-40 years and also has a history of excessive alcohol consumption. He is married with four grown children.   Past Medical History: 1. A known case of Hypertension for the past 15 years  on medication. 2. History of Hypercholesterolaemia  on statin therapy. 3. History of smoking heavy tobacco and heavy alcohol use. 4. Positive family history of cardiovascular diseases (father had a myocardial infarction  and a brother had a recent stroke). 5. Periodic health check-ups with no known allergies to medications.  Problem Representation:   Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old white male with a significant past medical history of long-term hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  heavy tobacco use  and familial cardiovascular diseases presents with a progressive and dull abdominal pain over the last two weeks. Pain is not associated with meals and radiates to his back. No recent changes in bowel habits  no nausea  vomits or weight changes have been reported. He admits of having experienced occasional palpitations and sweaty episodes accompanying this pain. On examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable in the abdomen slightly above the umbilicus. Given his risk factors and presentations  a further diagnostic workup for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is initiated.    It should be noted that the mention of Tobacco use and Hypertension is significant as they are risk factors for the development of an AAA  along with age >65  male gender  White race  and family history. Abdominal pain radiating to the back and occasional palpitations/sweaty episodes may suggest a possible aneurysmal rupture  which is a medical emergency.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,15,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male who is a former smoker with a pack-year history of 45 years. He has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications. He also has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a pulsatile abdominal mass  approximately 3 cm in diameter  found incidentally during a routine physical examination. He denies any abdominal or back pain  but reports a recent weight loss of about 10 lbs over the past few months. He denies any changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Background: According to the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are most common in elderly males  particularly over the age of 65. They are also prevalent among those of Caucasian descent. Factors such as smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerotic disease (including peripheral arterial disease) are significant risk factors for AAA. The fact that our patient is asymptomatic is not surprising  as many AAAs are often identified incidentally due to their silent course. The pulsatile mass in the abdomen is characteristic  and the weight loss is a concerning feature warranting further evaluation.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well controlled on medications. He has a significant smoking history of 45 pack-years  having quit 7 years ago  but remains at elevated risk due to his smoking history. He also has a documented history of peripheral artery disease.  Given the patient's age  gender  ethnicity  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease  his complete demographic characterization aligns well with the characteristic patient profile seen in literature relating to AAA.  Plan: The identified abdominal mass warrants further diagnostic testing  potentially including abdominal ultrasound  to validate its nature and size  which would dictate the course of treatment - whether surveillance or surgical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,16,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Subject is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired accountant  6'0"""" tall and weighing 190 pounds. He is a former smoker with a 15 pack-year history of smoking  quit 10 years ago. He has a moderate alcohol intake (two drinks a week). The patient lives with his wife in a suburban area. He is relatively active  enjoying daily walks in the morning.  Presenting Complaint: The patient came in with complaints of abdominal discomfort and occasional back pain over the last 2 months. The abdominal discomfort was described as a pulsating feeling near the navel and somewhat unpersistent. The back pain was described as a dull aching sensation.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). He was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 5 years ago and is managed with diet changes and Simvastatin 20mg daily. There is a known family history of cardiovascular disease - his father died of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at the age of 75  and his older brother (age 72) was previously diagnosed and successfully treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Social History: The patient is retired and lives with his wife. He is a former tobacco smoker (15 pack-years)  indicating a known risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm. He consumes alcohol in moderation and is not known to use illicit drugs. He used to be in a stressful job (accountant in a big firm).  Review of Systems:  Positive for abdominal pain and lower back pain. Negative for recent weight loss  loss of appetite  or changes in bowel habits. Overall  the pain is infrequent but noticeable enough that it led to the scheduling of the appointment.   Physical Examination:  Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass  though this is not always present in all cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Demographic representation:  This patient's profile aligns with the typical risk factors associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. According to the literature  this condition is more common in white males over 65 who are or were smokers. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which the patient has  are also known risk factors. "
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,17,Patient Profile: - Name: John Doe - Age: 72 years old - Gender: Male - Race: White (Caucasian) - Occupation: Retired - Location: Urban - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional moderate alcohol consumer.  Presenting Complaint:  John presents with occasional mild to moderate lower back pain. He mentions feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  which makes him uncomfortable.  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Hypertension managed on Lisinopril 10mg daily. - Hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin 20mg daily. - History of Heart Disease  underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) 5 years ago. - Family history: Father passed away due to ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  paternal uncle also had an AAA.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected in the mid-abdominal region. The patient experienced discomfort upon palpitation of the mass. No sign of lower limb peripheral artery disease was detected.   Further testing and diagnostic imaging revealed a 5.7cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta.   Problem Representation: A 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heart disease is presenting with a pulsatile abdominal mass and mild back pain. His previous family history includes close relatives who had an AAA  with a fatal rupture in his father. Diagnostic imaging has revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm. With the size of his aneurysm  and his personal and family medical history  he is at a high risk of rupture which could lead to life-threatening internal bleeding.  This profile is in line with the fact that abdominal aortic aneurysms are most commonly seen in males  typically over 65 years of age  and are frequently associated with cardiovascular diseases (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  heart diseases)  and often have an inherited aspect. The lifestyle of the person described is not uncommon for individuals with an AAA.  References: 1. Diseases of the aorta. In: Zipes DP  Libby P  Bonow RO  Mann DL  Tomaselli GF  Braunwald E  eds.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,18,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male  a former heavy smoker with a 30-pack year history but quit smoking about 10 years ago  moderate alcohol consumption  and BMI of 28.  Presenting Symptoms: Patient presents with asymptomatic]  incidentally found with dilatation of the abdominal aorta on an unrelated abdominal ultrasound. Reports occasional mild-to-moderate back pain and vague abdominal discomfort. Denies the presence of chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or fainting spells.  Past Medical History: His medical history is significant for:  1. Hypertension  controlled with medication. 2. High cholesterol  for which he is on statins. 3. Type II Diabetes Mellitus  managed through diet and Metformin. 4. A history of early coronary artery disease - percutaneous coronary intervention (stent placement) performed five years ago.  Family History: Positive for cardiovascular disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and his older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at age 75.  Social History: The patient is retired  a former construction worker. He is married  has 3 adult children  and lives with his wife. He states moderate weekly alcohol consumption and denies any illicit drug use.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs are stable. Physical examination reveals a soft abdomen with palpable pulsatile mass in the mid and lower abdomen. No bruits were noted. Rest of the systemic examination is unremarkable.  The above profile reflects the demography of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients as per literature  where AAAs are more common in males over 65 years old  Caucasian ethnicity  history of smoking  and other cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of vascular disease. Also  AAA patients are often asymptomatic and aneurysms are usually detected incidentally.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,19,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is 65-year old Caucasian male presenting with abdominal pain that has been worsening over the course of the past few days. He reports that the pain is sharp and occurs mostly in the middle to lower part of his abdomen. Sometimes it radiates to his lower back. His body mass index (BMI) is 30.5 kg/m2  which categorizes him as obese. He is a heavy smoker and has been smoking for about 45 years since his early 20s. The patient is retired and used to be in a profession involving physical labor (construction worker).   Past Medical History: His medical history is significant for hypertension which has been managed with Amlodipine for the past 10 years. Serum cholesterol levels are high (LDL 150 mg/dl  HDL 35 mg/dl). He has been on atorvastatin for the past 5 years. Recently  in a routine medical check-up  the elevated levels of Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen indicated the possibility of early-stage renal disease. Also  he informs about occasional peripheral edema that isn't associated with any noticeable pain. No known history of diabetes or any heart-related illnesses. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 75 and his mother had complications associated with high blood pressure.  Present Appointment: The current episode of the patient's visit was prompted by the detection of an abnormal swelling during a routine physical examination carried out by his primary care physician. Preliminary diagnosis suggested a potential abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which needs confirmation through imaging studies.  According to the literature  the main risk factors for AAA are age over 65  male sex  smoking  and a family history of AAA  hypertension  high cholesterol  and atherosclerosis which is most common in Caucasians. Obesity is also thought to slightly increase the risk. The risk also tends to be higher in individuals who have been involved in professions requiring heavy lifting  and in those with renal disease. Given the patient’s demographic details and medical history  he fits the characteristic profile of an individual at risk for AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,20,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Joseph Miller is a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Location: Mr. Miller lives in a suburban setting and is retired.  Presenting Symptoms: He visits the clinic today with complaints of constant abdominal pain for the last 2 weeks. He describes the pain as deep  aching  and sometimes severe. He also mentions experiencing an unusual pulsating sensation in his abdomen. He has not noticed any change in intensity with his normal daily activities or while eating. There has also been unsteadiness on his feet and a fainting episode  which lasted for a couple of minutes these past few days. He denies any recent trauma  weight loss  fever  cough  dysuria  changes in bowel movements  or other systemic symptoms.  Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. Miller has a history of hypertension  managed with hydrochlorothiazide and losartan for the past 15 years. He has mild hyperlipidemia and takes a daily statin. The patient also has a 45-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking ten years ago. His family history reveals that his father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 60.  Social History: He is a retired military officer and lives with his wife. His son lives nearby and often visits them. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use.  Relevant Psychiatric History: He has no history of psychiatric illness  but mentions occasional symptoms of anxiety related to his health conditions.  Allergies: He has no known drug allergies.  Medications: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide - 25 mg daily 2. Losartan - 50 mg daily 3. Atorvastatin - 20 mg daily  Exam: On physical exam  you note his pulse at 75 beats per minute  blood pressure 135/85 mmHg  and temperature 98.6F. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile  tender mass in the periumbilical area.  Tests:  The patient is advised for an abdominal ultrasound and CT angiography for further evaluation of suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Note: This problem representation is based on the demographic representation found in literature where the typical patient profile of an abdominal aortic aneurysm presents more in males  more specifically in the Caucasian race. Age factor plays a significant role as it has been found that the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm grows substantially with age  usually presenting between ages 65-75. Furthermore  the relative with AAA mentioned in the family history points towards a genetic predisposition. Hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking history (even if quit years ago) are notable risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,21,Problem Representation:  **Demographic Information:**  - Gender: Male  - Age: 72 years old  - Ancestry: White/ Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer - Lifestyle: Smoker (1 pack/day for the last 50 years). Excessive alcohol user. - Previous medical checkup: 1 year ago  **Medical History:**  - Patient has been previously diagnosed with hypertension  which is moderately controlled with medication (Metoprolol). Monthly BP averages ~ 145/90.  - Patient has a history of high cholesterol levels  controlled with statin therapy (Atorvastatin).  - Took treatment for vascular claudication about 4 years ago. - History of chronic cough – attributed to smoking. - Family history reveals that his father died of an aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 76.  **Presenting Complaints:**  - Patient reports experiencing mid-abdominal and lower back pain intermittently for the past month.  - Pain seems to be non-radiating and dull  and intensity increases when he lies down. - No associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  altered bowel movements  weight loss  or loss of appetite.  According to the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to occur most frequently in men aged 65-75 years who have a history of smoking. Roughly 75% of those affected are male. The condition is also more common in people of white ancestry and among those with a family history of the disease. Other risk factors include hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and a history of vascular disease.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,22,Problem Representation:  Demographics: Age: 78 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Lifestyle: A 35-year history of smoking  up to 1 pack a day Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Living in suburban environment   Presenting Problem:  The patient is a 78-year-old Caucasian male presenting with intense back pain  abdominal pain  and an uncomfortable pulsing sensation in his stomach area.   Relevant Past Medical History: - Hypertension since age 45  controlled by medication - Hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 15 years ago  managed with diet and medication - 10-year history of peripheral vascular disease - History of heart disease; father died due to myocardial infarction at age 68. - Quit smoking one year ago with a history of 35 years of smoking - Underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease in the past - Regular consultation with cardiologist   Given the patient's history  a potential diagnosis might be Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This hypothesis is consistent with the patient's reported symptoms  demographic characteristics  and his past medical history.   Reasoning: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is most common in older men  particularly those of white ethnicity  and a history of smoking  known atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease  peripheral vascular disease)  and hypertension is common in these patients  all of which are true for the patient under discussion. The intense back pain and abdominal fullness he complained about also suggest a significant aneurysm  potentially nearing rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,23,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic with abdominal pain. He is a retired construction worker and lives alone. His height is 5 feet 10 inches  and he weighs 80kg. His BMI is calculated as 25.2. Mr. Thompson has a 40-year history of smoking and quit five years ago. He has never used illicit drugs or consumed alcohol excessively.  Past Medical History: He has been diagnosed with hypertension for 15 years and has been on treatment with Amlodipine and Losartan. The patient also has a history of dyslipidemia for ten years  managed with Simvastatin. He does not have a history of diabetes mellitus or ischemic heart diseases. However  he had a transient ischemic attack seven years ago  with an uneventful recovery. There is no family history of early cardiovascular diseases or genetic disorders  but his mother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm surgically corrected in her late 70s.   Current Presentation: Mr. Thompson reports a steady  gnawing pain in his abdomen for the last three weeks  which radiates to his back. The pain occasionally intensifies and is relieved partially by bending forward. He also reports vaguely feeling feverish but has not measured his temperature. He also describes subjective weight loss over the last month but is unable to quantify it.   Relevance: The patient falls into a high-risk category for abdominal aortic aneurysm due to his age  gender  race  long history of smoking  and hypertension. The African American race is associated with a lower incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms  and he is a Caucasian male that forms the majority of AAA cases. Males are more commonly affected and usually in their late 60s to early 80s. He also comes from a demanding physical labor background  further adding to the risk profile. His mother's history of AAA also increases his risk  with a possible genetic predisposition. His presenting symptoms are consistent with a chronic contained rupture or impending rupture of an AAA.   The clinical representation aims to include accurate demographic representation  and the details align with the general epidemiology of AAA seen in literature. These data points guide the clinical thought process towards an abdominal aortic aneurysm in this patient  warranting further evaluation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,24,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  - Gender: Male - Age: 70 years - Race: Caucasian - Socioeconomic status: Middle-class - Occupation: Retired  Problem:  - Symptom: The patient presents intermittent  severe abdominal pain with a pulsing sensation  higher towards the navel area  not relieved by any medication usage. - Health Behavior: The patient has a 30-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day. He reports a moderate intake of alcohol (1-2 glasses of alcohol per day). He is also inactive with a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril. 2. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high cholesterol  managed with Atorvastatin. 3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes  managed with Metformin. 4. Family History: The patient's father died from a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 65.  Note:  This problem representation is generalized for a typical patient and is based on demographic and medical factors commonly associated with increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Key risk factors include male  older age  smoking history  high blood pressure  high cholesterol  and a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Those risk factors along with the presenting symptoms of the problem such as persistent abdominal pain and pulsing sensation towards navel area make an abdominal aortic aneurysm more probable. The patient is expected to be immediately referred to appropriate diagnostic testing such as ultrasound  a computed tomography (CT) scan  or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,25,Patient Profile: - Demographic Information:     Male  Caucasian  72 years old  non-Hispanic - Socioeconomic status: Retired  previously worked in a factory  mid-level income bracket. - Living situation: Lives alone  with regular visits from children and grandchildren. - Lifestyle: Smoker with a 40-pack year history  occasionally drinks alcohol  has a diet high in saturated fat. Sedentary lifestyle with little to no regular physical activity. - Family history: Father died of a heart attack at age 75  mother had a stroke in her late 60s.   Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed at age 65  managed with a combination of amlodipine and lisinopril - High cholesterol diagnosed at age 68  managed by atorvastatin  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed at age 68  managed with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids - History of intermittent claudication that has gradually worsened over the past 2 years - Previous peripheral vascular disease diagnosis at age 70 - A previous CT scan at age 70 revealed a small aortic aneurysm  3.2 cm.  The patient profile described above takes into account that the typical patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is likely to be male  aged 65 to 75  and a current or former smoker. Atherosclerotic disease is commonly associated with AAA  therefore  a past medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  peripheral vascular disease  and claudication was included. Retired socioeconomic status  Caucasian ethnicity  sedentary lifestyle  and high-fat diet are all additional risk factors associated with the development of AAA  as found in the literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,26,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. James is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a reported history of smoking  hypertension  and high cholesterol.  Presenting Complaint: He has been presenting frequent  severe abdominal and lower back pain with occasional dizziness over the past few weeks.  Past Medical History: Past medical history includes 20 years of smoking with recent cessation  controlled hypertension for 10 years  managed high cholesterol for 5 years.  Family History:  He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father suffering a fatal heart attack at the age of 65 and his older brother diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 72.  Lifestyle: He is retired and lives with his wife. He has quit smoking for over a year now but was a heavy smoker before. Diet history includes high consumption of fatty and processed foods. He exercises irregularly.  Clinical Findings On examination  his vitals are stable  but a pronounced pulsatile mass is palpable around the navel area. There are also signs of peripheral vasoconstriction. A preliminary ultrasound suggests the presence of an AAA with a diameter over 3 cm.  Risk Factors: The major risk factors evident in this context include the patient's age  genetic predisposition (family history of AAA)  former smoking habit  hypertension  high cholesterol  and male gender.  This representation is built on the understanding that cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and high cholesterol can contribute to the development of an AAA. Additionally  AAA prevalence is higher in males and those aged 65+ years. A family history of aneurysms  especially AAA  significantly increases an individual's risk.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,27,Problem Representation:  Demographics: Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  living in a suburban community. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history but quit 5 years ago. He has gained weight in the past decade and struggles with regular exercise because of arthritis.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with episodes of abdominal pain and discomfort which he describes as a pulsating feeling near his navel that lasts from a few minutes to hours. The pain severity varies  but there have been instances where it's severe enough to wake him up from his sleep.    Past Medical History: The patient has hypertension diagnosed at age 50  and poorly controlled Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus discovered at 55. His lipid profile indicates hyperlipidemia  and he also struggles with obesity (BMI: 33). He has a history of early stage COPD from his smoking years. There is no history of renal disease or any genetic disorders. He also has a familial history of AAA - his father died of a ruptured AAA in his late 70s.  Social history: The patient is married and has two adult children. He stopped heavy alcohol use in his 50s around the time of his hypertension diagnosis. He lives a moderately sedentary lifestyle due to his chronic joint pains from arthritis.   Clinical Examination: Abdominal examination reveals an expansile mass palpable in the abdomen. The mass seems to be pulsatile in nature suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Investigations: The patient is to undergo confirmatory imaging investigations via ultrasound or CT scan to assess the size of AAA and the degree of risk for rupture. Additionally  routine blood investigations including lipid profile  blood sugar levels  kidney function tests  ECG  and echocardiography are ordered.   This problem representation includes demographic and clinical factors consistent with the literature  which states that AAA most commonly occurs in older men  particularly those of Caucasian heritage  with a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of AAA.

He has been unusually sweaty and dizzy in the past few days.  Family Medical History:  No known family history of cardiovascular diseases or abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother had Diabetes and father passed away from colon cancer.  John's Past Medical History:  1. Medical History: John has been hypertensive for 10 years and has been managing it with medication. He was clinically diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 6 years ago and had a minor stroke 2 years ago with no residual impairment. He has considerable atherosclerosis and is at risk of cardiovascular diseases.  2. Surgical History: Underwent prostate surgery for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia 5 years back.  3. Psychosocial History: John is an ex-smoker who quit smoking 15 years ago. He drinks alcohol periodically  about 3-4 times a week.  4. Medication History: John is on anti-hypertensive medication  aspirin for blood thinning  and statins for managing his cholesterol levels.  5. Allergies: No known drug allergies.  In light of the sudden onset and continuous nature of his abdominal pain  along with his personal medical history and risk factors such as being a male over 70 years  having a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected.  Note: The patient's demographic details and medical history were taken from typical patient profiles and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm as found in medical literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,29,Patient Profile: Mr. Charles  a 72-year-old Caucasian male presents with abdominal pain. He is a retired welder  lives alone  does not have any children  and is a widower.  Demographics: Age >65 years  White  Male  Social History:  Mr. Charles has a history of smoking  with a 40 pack/year history  though he quit smoking ten years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. His diet contains high-cholesterol food.  Medical History:  Past consistent complaints were hypertension  hyperlipidemia  mild kidney disease and coronary artery disease. He previously had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago that was managed with drug therapy. Mr. Charles has familial history of aortic aneurysm  his father died of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Physical Exam: On physical examination  Mr. Charles is noticed to be obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31. On auscultation  a rhythmic abdominal bruit over the periumbilical area was detected. His blood pressure is elevated (145/90 mmHg) and pulse rate is regular.  Lab Examination: The lipid profile shows elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and reduced levels of HDL cholesterol. Kidney function tests indicate mild renal insufficiency.  Medical Imaging: An abdominal ultrasound confirms the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4.5 cm in diameter.  Problem Representation (Assessment and Plan): Mr. Charles  a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and familial history of aortic aneurysm has been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Lifestyle modifications including dietary changes and exercise should be recommended. Blood pressure and cholesterol should be closely monitored and managed with medication if necessary. The abdominal aortic aneurysm should be closely monitored with regular ultrasound examinations to monitor any change in diameter. Given the identified risk factors  thorough discussions about the risk and benefits of prophylactic surgery at the appropriate time are warranted. Regular follow up appointments are necessary.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,30,Patient Profile:   - Name: John Doe - Age: 70  - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired - Marital Status: Married - Residence: Urban - Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  under medication. 2. Smoking: Heavy smoker (2 packs/day) for 50 years  quit 5 years ago. 3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Due to heavy smoking history  diagnosed 8 years ago. 4. Peripheral arterial disease: Diagnosed 3 years ago. 5. High cholesterol: Diagnosed 15 years ago  under medication.  Family History:   1. Father passed away at age 68 due to myocardial infarction. 2. Mother passed away at age 74 due to stroke. 3. Younger brother aged 67 has an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Complaint:   Non-specific abdominal pain and back pain for the past month. Not relieved by over-the-counter medication. Noticing an increase in frequency of the pain over the past week.  Physical Examination:   On examination  a pulsatile mass is felt in the abdomen.   Diagnostic Results:   Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm.  Problem Representation:   A 70-year-old Caucasian male  previously diagnosed with hypertension  high cholesterol  COPD  and peripheral arterial disease  presents with non-specific abdominal and back pain for one month. He is a former heavy smoker with family history notable for cardiovascular diseases and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which is further confirmed by abdominal ultrasound.    Demographic information is based on observed trends in literature which suggest that abdominal aortic aneurysms are more frequently diagnosed in older males  particularly those with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol and COPD. They also have a higher prevalence among Caucasians and there is a genetic predisposition involved.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,31,Patient Profile: Name: John  Age: 70 years old  Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Urban area  Marital Status: Married Social History: Smoker for about 30 years  stopped 5 years ago  history of moderate alcohol consumption  no recreational drug usage  non-vegetarian diet.  Presenting Complaint: Intermittent abdominal pain for last two weeks  feeling of pulsation in the abdomen  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  well managed with medicamentous treatment 2. Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed 3 years ago  under treatment 3. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 5 years ago  well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents 4. History of a Myocardial Infarction 1 year ago 5. No history of any stroke or transient ischemic attacks  6. No history of any malignancies or immunosuppressive therapy  7. History of peripheral artery disease  Family History: Father had a diagnosed Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  mother had hypertension and diabetes  Medications: Antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors)  Statins for dyslipidemia  Metformin for diabetes  Antiplatelet drugs (Clopidogrel)  Vitamins and Mineral Supplements   The choice of this specific demographic (elderly male  ex-smoker  hypertensive  diabetic  with previous cardiovascular disease and peripheral artery disease) is based on literature reporting these factors as common risks for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. A family history of the disease also enhances these risks.   The typical location of the pain (back or middle of the abdomen)  intermittent nature  and the feeling of pulsation need to be confirmed with ultrasonography. The condition is often asymptomatic until rupture occurs  hence screening based on risk factors plays a vital role in early detection.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,32,"Patient Problem Representation:  Demographics:  A 65-year-old male  Caucasian  retired military officer  living with his wife in a suburban area. He has a high socioeconomic status and private health insurance. He is an active smoker with a 40-pack year history and an occasional drinker. He is non-vegetarian and has a high fat diet.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and is on regular medication (Losartan 50mg per day). 2. Hyperlipidemia: The patient also has high cholesterol levels for which he has been taking atorvastatin (20mg daily) for the past 10 years. 3. Atherosclerosis: Diagnosed with early atherosclerosis 10 years ago  managed by lifestyle modification and appropriate antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. 4. Smoking History: The patient has a prolonged history of smoking but has reduced his smoking significantly for the last 5 years. 5. A positive family history of cardiovascular diseases includes both his father and grandfather who had myocardial infarctions in their late sixties.  Current Complaint:  Over the past few months  the patient has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain and occasional lower back pain. The pain is not associated with meals  bowel movements  or any other specific factors. The patient states that during the past week  the abdominal pain appears to have increased in intensity and frequency. He also mentions feeling a """"pulsatile mass"""" in his abdomen occasionally.  This demographic and medical history representation aligns with literature findings that show abdominal aortic aneurysm is more common in older  Caucasian men who smoke or have a history of smoking  atherosclerosis  hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and a family history of cardiovascular disease."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,33,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 75 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Habits: smoker for past 40 years; moderate alcohol consumption Occupation: retired banker Resident status: urban setting  Presenting Complaint: Patient has been experiencing persistent abdominal pain for the past several weeks  sometimes extending to the back.  Medical History: 1. Hypertension for past 10 years  on regular medication. 2. High cholesterol level  taking statins. 3. History of angina  managed conservatively.  Family History: Father suffered and died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Physical Examination: On auscultation  an abdominal bruit is heard. There is mild tenderness in the abdominal area.  Demographic representation (as per available literature): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is primarily a disease of older adults  with the incidence increasing with advancing age  and is rare before the age of 60. It is also more common in males  with a 4:1 male to female ratio. Smoking and a family history of AAA significantly increase the risk. Moreover  these aneurysms are more frequently encountered in Caucasian populations than African-American populations. Other predisposing factors include hypertension  high cholesterol level  heart diseases and certain genetic conditions that affect the blood vessels.  Problem Representation: An elderly  Caucasian  male patient with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol levels and angina is presenting with persistent abdominal and sometimes back pain. Given his family history  it is highly possible that the patient could have an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Furthermore  the presence of an abdominal bruit and tenderness make the diagnosis more likely. The patient's presentation is consistent with the typical demographic and risk factor profile found in the literature for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The next step is to confirm the diagnosis through appropriate imaging studies.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,34,Problem Statement: A 71-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with constant and severe pain in the lower part of his abdomen  with complaints of tenderness  nausea and lightheadedness. The patient is slightly obese with a BMI of 30. He has a 45-year history of smoking  consuming approximately 15 cigarettes per day. Additionally  he has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol levels and has been receiving treatment for the same. He does not have any history of cardiovascular disease. Past medical history also shows that the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement 10 years ago. Family history is significant for a brother who had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  Patient Demographics: - Age: 71 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - BMI: 30 (overweight) - Smoking status: Current  45-year history  approximately 15 cigarettes/day  Relevant Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia  - Aortic valve replacement - No history of cardiovascular disease  Family History: - Brother with an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair  Presenting Symptoms: - Constant  severe abdominal pain  particularly in the lower region - Tenderness in abdomen - Nausea - Lightheadedness  This profile representation is based on typical findings from demographic research that suggest abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more frequently in men  typically over the age of 65  with Caucasian men being at higher risk. Smoking  lifestyle factors resulting in obesity  and a family history of the condition also increase the risk. Further  hypertension and high cholesterol levels have been linked with a higher risk of developing an aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,35,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic Details:  Gender: Male (likelihood of abdominal aortic aneurysm is higher in males than females) Age: 70 years old (the risk increases significantly for individuals above the age of 60) Ethnicity: Caucasian (abdominal aortic aneurysm has a higher incidence rate among Caucasians) Lifestyle: Long term cigarette smoker (smoking is a leading risk factor)  Relevant Past Medical History:  - History of peripheral vascular disease: The patient has been treated for peripheral vascular disease; this increases the risk of having abdominal aortic aneurysm. - Hypertension: The patient is suffering from hypertension. - High cholesterol: There is a history of high cholesterol. He is on statin therapy. - Family history: The patient’s father died due to abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. - Past invasive vascular procedures: Older gentleman with a history of undergoing invasive vascular procedures that increase the risk. - Genetic connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome.  Presenting Complaints:  - Consistent and severe abdominal or back pain that maintains its intensity - Recognition of a pulse near the navel. - Unexpected  rapid pulse.  Physical Examination Findings:  - Abdominal tenderness to palpation in the area around the navel  with a pulsating mass noticed in the abdomen. - Increased abdominal girth  evidence of noticeable and rapid growth of the aneurysm. - A bruit (an abnormal sound heard when a stethoscope is applied)  noticeable over the aneurysm.    Possible Investigations:  - Abdominal ultrasound: To identify the presence and size of the aneurysm - CT Scan: In case of suspicion of rupture or need of more detailed imaging - Blood tests: To identify any underlying cause or related complications  Diagnosis:  Based on presenting complaints  physical examination findings  and investigations  the patient is likely suffering from Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Indicators include sudden and severe pain in his abdomen or back  the presence of a pulsating sensation around the navel  hypertension  high cholesterol  peripheral vascular disease history  positive family history  and smoking.  Potential Management:  The management plan usually depends on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm:  - Regular monitoring: If the aneurysm is small  regular monitoring with ultrasound is administered. - Medication: Anti-hypertensives and statins may be given to control blood pressure and cholesterol levels respectively. - Surgical intervention: If the aneurysm is larger  or growing rapidly  or causing symptoms  surgery is considered.  Please note patients should be counseled about the risk of rupture and the life-threatening nature of this condition. Smoking cessation is also crucial in management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,36,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents with complaints of abdominal and lower back pain that has been persisting for the last few days. He reportedly experienced a brief episode of fainting two days back. The patient has a history of smoking and has been treated for high blood pressure (hypertension) over the last 15 years.  Chief Complaint: The patient reports the pain being constant but not severe; however  he is concerned primarily due to the constant nature of the pain than the severity.  History of Present Illness: The pain originated in the central lower abdomen and seems to radiate to the back. The patient reports no significant change in bowel movements or urination. He notes a loss of appetite but no weight loss  fever  chills  or night sweats. The fainting episode was short-lived and the patient regained consciousness without any intervention.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which he is taking Lisinopril. He is a current smoker with a 50-pack year history. He also reports routine consumption of alcohol but denies any drug usage. The patient’s father reportedly died from an """"abdominal aneurysm.""""  Physical Exam: The patient is in no apparent distress. His blood pressure is 145/95 mmHg and heart rate is 85 bpm. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile mass approximately 5 cm in diameter located in the periumbilical area. The rest of the physical exam is within normal limits.  Studies: You plan to order a CT scan of the abdomen to further evaluate the aneurysm.  Impressions: Based on the history  physical exam  and family history  there is a high suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Plan: Pending the results of the CT scan  you discuss with the patient the potential need for surgical intervention  either an open surgical repair or an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR)  and advise him to quit smoking."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,37,Problem Representation:  Patient profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male  Demographic information: - Age: Elderly (70 years) - Gender: Male (as 80% of abdominal aortic aneurysm patients are male) - Ethnicity: Caucasian (As Caucasian men have the highest prevalence rate)  Past medical history: - Cardiovascular: History of hypertension (a major risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm)  previous cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. - Smoking: Ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago. Smoked 1 pack/day for 40 years (as risk factors increase with smoking) - Comorbidities: Dyslipidemia  diabetes (both are risk factors) - Family history: Father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (as the risk is higher in those with a family history)  Presenting symptoms: - Pain: Chronic  low-grade abdominal and/or back pain - Physical Examination: An abdominal pulsatile mass palpable on physical examination   Historic data suggest that this patient fits the typical profile for an individual at risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  a life-threatening condition that requires medical attention. The patient's age  gender  ethnicity  and smoking history all align with the demographic characteristics commonly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. His cardiovascular history and presence of comorbidities like hypertension  dyslipidemia and diabetes increase his risk significantly. His family history of aarts their risk further. Whilst our patient isn't currently presenting with the acute symptoms of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  the chronic abdominal pain and the presence of an abdominal mass may suggest an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,38,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   1. Demographic Information: A 72-year-old Caucasian male 2. Socioeconomic Status: Retired technician  living with his wife. They have two grown children who live out of state. 3. Health Insurance: Participant in a government-funded healthcare program for seniors 4. Lifestyle: Moderate smoker for over 50 years  occasional alcohol consumption 5. Religion: Catholic  regularly attends church services  Medical History:  1. Chronic Diseases: Diagnosed with high blood pressure 12 years ago  controlled with medication. 2. Surgical History: Underwent bilateral knee replacement surgery a few years ago. 3. Allergies: Known allergy to Penicillin. 4. Medication: Atenolol for hypertension.  Presenting Problem:   The patient comes into the clinic with a complaint of a noticeable  pulsating mass in his abdomen  which he just recently discovered. He also mentions episodes of brief  acute abdominal pain that does not seem related to meals or physical activity. There's no history of injury to the abdomen  and there doesn't seem to be any particular triggers for the pain.  Family History:   His father died from a stroke at age 80  mother lived to 85 and died of complications related to osteoporosis. One brother  aged 75  diagnosed with prostate cancer.   Physical Examination:  The examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the center of the abdomen. The patient is mildly tender to palpation at this site  no signs of rupture or severe abdominal pain. No other abnormalities identified.    This typical patient profile aligns with many aspects of the typical abdominal aortic aneurysm patient described in various literature. According to the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most commonly in Caucasian males over 65 who have a history of smoking. Hypertension is also a known risk factor. As this is a problem that often exists without noticeable symptoms until possible rupture  the patient presentation of a pulsating abdominal mass and non-acute pain also fits the typical profile.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,39,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. X is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the clinic with a history of a dull  gnawing pain in his abdominal area and back  which he noticed for the last two months. The patient also complained of occasional lightheadedness and a sense of uneasiness.  Social History: Mr. X is a retired military officer. He has been a chronic smoker for the last 45 years with a smoking history of approximately 60 pack-years. He drinks alcohol moderately  about one to two drinks per day and follows a diet high in fats and cholesterol. He hardly has any physical activity due to mobility issues related to mild arthritis.  Medical History: Mr. X has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications. He underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery ten years ago due to coronary artery disease. He is also on prophylactic low-dose aspirin following his CABG surgery. He has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years back. He also has a family history of aortic aneurysms.  Medications: Mr. X has been prescribed a beta-blocker (Atenolol) for hypertension  a statin (Simvastatin) for hyperlipidemia  and a regular low-dose aspirin.  Analysis: Given Mr. X's age  race  sex  a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  coronary artery disease  peripheral artery disease  chronic use of low-dose aspirin  and family history of aortic aneurysms  he falls under the high-risk category for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Clinically he may be diagnosed with a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm based on presenting symptoms of chronic stomach pain  particularly given his risk factors. It becomes imperative to further investigate Mr. X's condition with appropriate diagnostic tests  including Ultrasound  CT scan  or MRI.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking presents to the clinic for a routine check-up.  Complaints:  The patient does not have obvious symptoms or complaints. Any symptoms related to AAA  if present  are vague and non-specific such as abdominal  back  or groin pain.  Past Medical History: 1. The patient has a history of hypertension. 2. The patient used to be a heavy smoker but quit 10 years ago.  3. He has a history of coronary artery disease and had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago.  4. There's a family history of AAA in his older brother.  Relevant Physical Findings:  On examination  there's central pulsating mass in the abdomen.  Relevant Investigation Findings: Ultrasound abdomen shows infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 5.1 cm in diameter which indicates AAA.  The demographics chosen for this problem representation are based on AAA being most common in older Caucasian males  particularly those with a history of smoking  hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. Family history is also a strong risk factor.  Clinical Problem: Asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an elderly man with a high-risk profile inclusive of former heavy smoking  hypertension  coronary artery disease and family history of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,41,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a Caucasian male aged close to 70 years old. He is a former smoker with a history of twenty years of heavy smoking before he quit around 20 years ago. He has a family history of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) with his late father having been diagnosed with the condition in his 70s.   Medical History: He has hypertension that has been well controlled with antihypertensive medication for the last 15 years. He was screened for AAA around five years ago and the results were negative. He has been maintaining a fairly active lifestyle since retirement and reports no major debilitating illnesses.  He has no history of peripheral artery disease or cerebrovascular disease but did have elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels that were managed with statins.  Presenting Complaints: He has attended this clinic visit due to a queer sensation of a pulsating mass in his abdomen  which he has been feeling for the past couple of weeks. Accompanied dull abdominal pain and occasional lower back pain which he initially thought was due to aging and possible strain. He reports no weight loss  changes in appetite  or gastric discomfort.  Given the patient's history of smoking  family history of AAA  presence of hypertension  advancing age  the presenting symptoms  as well as his male sex - the clinical picture leads to a high suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,42,Patient Profile:  Name: James Smith Age: 72 years old  Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Demographic Details: Retired mechanical engineer  lives alone  occasional smoker  and alcohol user.  Medical History: James has been diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  for which he was under medication. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol 10 years ago and started on lipid-lowering agents. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease 5 years back and was successfully stented. Family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father died of a stroke at age 68 and his mother had an aortic aneurysm. James follows a low salt  low cholesterol diet but has been a casual smoker for last 50 years. His BMI falls within the overweight scale. He was also previously diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease.  Presenting Problem: James presented to the Emergency Room complaining of severe sudden onset of lower back and abdominal pain. He also reported feeling light-headed and break out in a cold sweat.  Problem Representation:  72-year-old male  with a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  coronary artery disease  and peripheral vascular disease  presents with severe sudden onset of lower back and abdominal pain  lightheadedness  and sweating. Given the patient’s history  immediate concern is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA occurs more frequently in older men  smokers  and those with a family history of the condition  all of which apply to this patient. AAA is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical intervention if the aneurysm has ruptured.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,43,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old male  of Caucasian ethnicity  smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history  who has been experiencing severe pain in the back and belly that started suddenly about 1 hour ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for which he takes a daily dosage of Lisinopril. His cholesterol level is slightly elevated (LDL 160). Personal medical history also includes Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) diagnosed 5 years ago for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Family history is significant  with the patient's father reportedly dying from an aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Symptoms: Patient reports that the pain was sudden in onset  severe  and located in the lower abdomen and back. The patient also notes feelings of lightheadedness and nausea. No previous episodes of a similar nature have been noted.  Vitals at Time of Presentation: Blood pressure: 145/85 mmHg  Heart rate: 105 beats per minute  Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute  Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit  O2 Sat: 95% on room air.  Clinician Impression:  The demographics  past medical history  family history  and symptoms  suggest a potential Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The distribution of the patient's pain can suggest an AAA  which can present with pain in the abdomen and/or back. The fact that his father had an aortic aneurysm puts him at a higher risk of suffering from the same. Furthermore  the patient has various risk factors including advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  smoking history  and history of atherosclerotic vascular disease (hypertension and CAD).  ** The above case mix reflects the demographic distribution found in literature for AAA  where highest incidence is among African-Americans and men over the age of 65 who smoke and have atherosclerosis  CAD or family history of AAA.

Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 20 years  medication managed - Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  medication managed - Diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 10 years ago  under medication - History of early vascular disease (i.e.  brother died of stroke in early 60s) - Underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago.  Family History: - Father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 70 - Mother had strokes  deceased at the age of 80 - Brother died of stroke in his early 60s - No family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Social History: - Smokes 1 pack/day for last 50 years - Alcohol: 2-3 drinks per week - Diet rich in fats and carbohydrates  limited physical excerise. - Retired factory worker  living with wife in suburban area  Review of Systems: - Cardiovascular: No chest pain or shortness of breath.  - Respiratory: Chronic cough  no hemoptysis. - Musculoskeletal: Lower back pain  no joint pain. - Gastroenterology: No nausea or vomiting  occasional constipation  no change in bowel habits or color. - Neurological: No headache  dizziness or syncope.  Physical Exam: - Vital Signs: Blood Pressure 160/90 mmHg   Pulse 90 bpm  Respiration 16 breaths/minute  Temperature 98.2 F  BMI 30. - Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm  no murmurs.  - Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Chronic cough  no distress - Abdominal: Pulses present  pulsatile mass in periumbilical region  tenderness to deep palpation.  Based on the above representation  the patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The patient's age  gender  smoking history  and cardiovascular comorbidities put him at a high risk for AAA. Clinical validation with imaging studies like ultrasound or CT is necessary for confirmation and further management planning.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,45,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characteristic: Mr. Alois is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  retired from his job as a government employee government. He is a former smoker  having smoked for approximately 30 years before quitting in his late 50s. He is overweight  with a recorded BMI of 28  and an occasional alcohol drinker. He lives by himself and doesn't do heavy physical activity  with primary engagement being gardening and reading newspapers. He has a family history  with his father and two uncles dying of cardiovascular concerns  including an aortic aneurysm.   Past Medical History: Mr. Alois has had hypertension for the last 15 years and is on regular medication (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors) to control his blood pressure. He also has a diagnosis of mild COPD due to his past smoking habits and is on regular bronchodilator therapy. He takes daily low-dose aspirin for prophylaxis against heart disease. He has occasional episodes of angina when he exerts himself physically. Five years back  he underwent a peripheral intervention for significant peripheral artery disease in his right lower leg. He controls his cholesterol levels with diet and statin medication.  Present Complaints and Possible Diagnosis: Recently  Mr. Alois has been experiencing unspecific abdominal pain  irregularly  which disturbs him particularly when he does gardening or any sort of bending activity. He denies feeling a pulsating mass in his abdomen or any back pain but reports a new onset of discomfort in his legs when walking small distances. Considering his signs and symptoms  family history  and lifestyle  an abdominal aortic aneurysm seems plausible and warrants further diagnostic investigation.  Note: This presentation represents a typical demographic with higher prevalence for abdominal aortic aneurysm including age  sex  ethnicity and key risk factors like smoking history  hypertension  family history of aortic aneurysm  and peripheral artery disease. Literature suggests that abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in Caucasian males in their 60s and 70s and those with a history of smoking and cardiovascular diseases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,46,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 75 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Location: Urban city in the United States - Smoking History: 40 pack-years  currently not smoking - Alcohol Usage: Moderate - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 55  controlled with medication (Lisinopril). 2. Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed in his 60s  managed with statin therapy. 3. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): Diagnosed at age 70  resulting in intermittent claudication. 4. Heart Disease: History of coronary artery disease  with a myocardial infarction at age 72. Underwent a balloon angioplasty and stent placement. 5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): History of chronic bronchitis since his 60s  related to his smoking history. 6. Type 2 Diabetes: Diagnosed at age 65  managed with Metformin. 7. Family History: His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which ruptured at 82 years old.  Presenting problems: - Mild to moderate pain in the lower back or flank area that has been persistent for the past one week. - A pulsating feeling near the navel area. - On examination  a palpable mass is noted in the mid-abdominal region. - Routine ultrasound for his peripheral artery disease has indicated a dilated aorta.  This patient profile factors in  based on literature  the higher prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms among older males  especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  and a family history of the condition. The clinical presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm often doesn't manifest until the aneurysm is large or ruptures. This patient's potential risk factors and clinical symptoms suggest the need for further diagnostic investigations such as CT angiography or MRI.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,47,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Richard Thompson is a 72-years-old Caucasian male living in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired industrial worker and lives with his wife. He is currently 5ft 10in tall  weighing 200 pounds. He is a former smoker having quit 9 years ago after a 40 pack-year history. Richard has a moderate alcohol consumption habit  claiming to drink 2-3 cans of beer on weekends. Richard comes from a family with a strong history of cardiovascular diseases - his father passed away from a stroke at an early age  and his older brother underwent bypass surgery for coronary artery disease.  Past Medical History: Richard has been diagnosed with chronic hypertension for the past 20 years and is on medication  though he is often noncompliant stating that it makes him feel weak. He also has moderate hyperlipidemia and Type 2 diabetes which is controlled by metformin. Richard also has a past medical history of a transient ischemic attack about 10 years ago.  Recent complaints: Recently  he has been experiencing mild discomfort in the middle of the abdomen. He fails to recognize this symptom due to its subtle and intermittent nature. The discomfort doesn't seem to be related to meals  body position  or physical activity. He denies any change in bowel habits  blood in stool  difficulties in urination  fever  weight loss  or night sweats.  Physical Evaluation and Diagnostics: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is felt which raises the clinical suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Richard claims never to have any form of abdominal imaging before and is referred for a diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.  This portrayal touches on the major risk factors of abdominal aortic aneurysm: elderly male  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking history. Tobacco use is the most significant risk factor  responsible for approximately 75 percent of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. Nearly all abdominal aortic aneurysms are attributed in some part to atherosclerosis  which is why the same risk factors that lead to heart disease and stroke — high blood pressure  high cholesterol  diabetes  and smoking — also put you at risk for an aortic aneurysm.

He denies any recent trauma. He occasionally experiences mild to moderate back pain and some bloating. He also reports a pulsating feeling in his abdomen. However  he has not experienced any severe sudden onset of abdominal or back pain  nausea  vomiting  constipation  or diarrhea. No urinary or bowel complaints.   Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with medication. - Ruptured appendicitis  surgically treated in his 40s. - Smoked for 30 years but quit 10 years ago.  Family History:  - Father died from stroke at age 85.  - Mother alive and well at age 90.  - One older brother  died of lung cancer age 78  was a smoker.  Review of Systems:  - No weight loss  fever  or any other systemic symptoms of malignancy. - Denies any chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  Physical Examination:  On palpation  a pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the midline infraumbilical region.  Summary:   Mr. James Williams is a 75-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and previous smoking  who presents with symptoms suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm including non-specific abdominal discomfort  back pain  and pulsating feeling in the abdomen. Physical exam reveals a palpable infraumbilical mass  which pulses alongside the heartbeat.   Patient fits the typical risk profile for an abdominal aortic aneurysm: older age  male  smoker  history of hypertension. His vague abdominal and back symptoms over the past weeks  along with the pulsating feeling in his abdomen  strongly suggest a slowly expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm. A diagnostic imaging study (abdominal ultrasound or CT scan) would be advisable for confirmatory diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,49,Patient Representation:  Mr. John Doe is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the clinic with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain and episodes of intense back pain. He is a long-term smoker  smoking one pack of cigarettes/day for the past 40 years. He has a known history of hypertension since 50 years of age  which is managed with medication  an unhealthy diet with predilection for high fat foods and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  His hypertension has been difficult to manage  with frequent fluctuations observed even with medication. His past medical records indicate moderately raised cholesterol levels as well. He also carries a family history of cardiovascular diseases  as his father suffered from coronary artery disease and his eldest brother had died of a stroke. He also reports a history of sudden death in a paternal uncle which was not explained.  Apart from smoking  Mr. Doe used to consume alcohol regularly until his mid-60s  although he claims to have significantly reduced his intake over the past 5-6 years. Prior to his retirement  he used to work in a high-stress job  which he admits had been a significant source of stress.  Despite his abdominal discomfort and back pain  he denies any hemodynamic instability or feelings of faintness or lightheadedness. Given his advanced age  long history of smoking  hypertension  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and the symptoms he describes  there is a significant concern about the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and further investigations are needed.

Normal lipid profile due to statin therapy. - Diagnostic imaging (abdominal ultrasound): AAA with a maximum diameter of 5.5cm  IV. Risk factors: - Male gender - Advanced age - Smoking history - Hypertension - Family history of AAA - Caucasian ethnicity  V. Probable Diagnosis:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  VI. Management Plan: Considering patient's age  size of aneurysm  comorbidities and symptomatic presentation  an open or endovascular repair surgery should be planned. Intensive lifestyle modification (smoking cessation)  and strict blood pressure control may also be part of the management plan.  Note: The characteristics given above represent an stereotype based on literature. Actual patients may have any combination of characteristics. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms are found most commonly in men  in individuals aged 65 and older  and are more common in Caucasian compared to other ethnicities. Smoking and a family history of AAA are also significant risk factors for developing AAA. The presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia can also contribute to the development of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,52,Problem Representation:  Patient Name: Mr. Smith Gender: Male Age: 70 years Ethnicity: White Occupation: Retired Engineer  Chief Complaint: Patient presents with complaints of intermittent  unexplained abdominal or lower back pain which has lasted for several weeks.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and has been noted to smoke within the past 30 years. Additionally  he has a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  specifically with his father having had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Conclusion:  John  a 72 years old Caucasian male with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  heart disease  and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm  is suspected with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The condition was confirmed by ultrasound and CT scan  which showed an aortic aneurysm of 5.5cm. Further investigations and management are to be planned.   Note: Statistically  abdominal aortic aneurysms are most commonly seen in males over 65  particularly those with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease  confirming the demographics represented in this problem.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,54,Patient Representation:  Patient: Mr. Albert Rodriguez Sex: Male Age: 70 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Albert Rodriguez  a 70-year-old Caucasian retired male  presents with a complaint of unexplained lower-back and abdominal pain. He has been feeling one-sided backache for the past few weeks  which according to him is different from the usual arthritis pain he has been living with. Recently  he has also experienced episodes of abdominal pain. His appetite has declined over the past few weeks  and he admits that he has lost some weight unintentionally. He denies trauma  but has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels  for which he is on medication. He also has a 40-pack-year smoking history  though he quit approximately five years ago.  Family history is significant for a father who died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75. Because of his family history  he has been alert to the symptoms commonly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  such as tenderness around the navel  lower-back pain  and unexplained weight loss. A faint pulsating feeling near his navel area  which was never there before  has also been bothering him recently.  It's important to note that Mr. Rodriguez has been leading a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. He has a history of irregular follow-up appointments for his hypertension and cholesterol and has been largely non-compliant with his medications. Known allergies include penicillin. He does not consume alcohol. His BMI is 30.2 kg/m2  which places him in the obese category. He has otherwise been in fair health  has no history of surgeries  and reports no other symptoms.   With aging  smoking  a family history of AAA  hypertension  high LDL levels  obesity  a genetic predisposition to arterial disease  male gender  and Caucasian ethnicity  Mr. Rodriguez is at high risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Symptoms such as lower-back pain and tenderness near the navel further indicate the possibility of an AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,55,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 70 years Gender: Male Race: White Residence: Urban  United States Background: Retired  lives with wife  Medical History:  Primary Disease Presenting: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Medical Profile: Hypertension  Moderate Chronic Kidney Disease  Smoker (30 pack years) Medication History: ACE Inhibitors for hypertension Family History: Father died due to AAA rupture at the age of 73 Social History: Smoked 1.5 pack/day for 20 years  quit 10 years ago. Drinks alcohol socially  denies drugs use  Presenting Symptoms:  None (AAA found incidentally on ultrasound done for yearly check-up)  Physical Examination Findings: Abdominal bruit found over upper abdomen  Investigations: Abdominal ultrasound: Shows AAA of 4.5 cm diameter  Comorbidities to consider in the treatment plan: Hypertension - The risk of AAA growth and rupture is increased by hypertension.  Chronic Kidney Disease - Potential renal issues during intervention due to contrast use.   Demographics are based on literature  which suggests that patients with AAA are more likely to be older  male  smokers with hypertension. The family history of AAA and White race are additional risk factors.  Patient Representation:  """"Mr. John Doe is a 70-year-old white male from an urban setting in the United States  with a medical history significant for hypertension and moderate chronic kidney disease. He has been taking ACE inhibitors for the hypertension. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit smoking 10 years ago. His social history also reveals that he consumes alcohol socially.

He is asymptomatic for now with only positive physical finding being an abdominal bruit."""""
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,56,Problem Representation:  Patient Identification: A 68-year-old Caucasian male is presenting for his annual physical.   Presenting Complaint: The patient complains of sporadic  mild to moderate abdominal pain that seems unrelated to food intake or other digestive issues.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of atherosclerosis and borderline hypertension which is managed by diet and medication. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. However  he quit smoking 10 years ago and has only occasional alcohol intake now. He also reports exercise-induced fatigue and back pain which he attributes to aging.  Family History: His genetic background reveals that his father passed away from an ischemic heart attack at the age of 70  and his older brother was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Clinical Examination Findings: Physical examination reveals a palpable and pulsatile mass in the blood vessels approximately 2cm above the umbilicus. No alarming symptoms such as sudden  intense abdominal or back pain  or signs of shock are present indicating rupture.  Diagnostic Tests: To confirm clinician's suspicion and provide a definitive diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  the patient is referred for a Doppler ultrasound scan  which reveals an enlarged abdominal aorta exceeding normal diameter thresholds.   This problem representation-as it's stands- is an attempt to highlight the important features of a typical case presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm  which should guide diagnosis and management strategies. The patient represents a characteristic demographic (an older  Caucasian male with a personal and family history of relevant health issues) found likely to be diagnosed with this condition. The symptomatology and relevant lifestyle factors (e.g. significant smoking history) are also indicative of a potential abdominal aortic aneurysm  underpinning the importance of thorough clinical evaluation and imaging tests for accurate diagnosis and prevention of possible life-threatening consequences.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,57,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 45 year pack history of cigarette smoking.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient has been complaining about constant and severe abdominal pain which radiates to the back  along with a noticeable pulsating sensation near the navel. This is combined with periods of high lightheadedness  nausea  and sudden drops in blood pressure.  Risk Factors: Patient has multiple risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm including advanced age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  and history of chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The most significant risk factor is his prolonged history of cigarette smoking. Although the patient is no longer smoking  he has had a considerable exposure to cigarette smoke in his lifetime.  Previous Medical History: Apart from hypertension and high cholesterol  the patient’s past medical history also includes obesity and moderate alcohol use. There are no known allergies. The family history reveals a positive record for heart diseases including his father who died from a heart attack  and an older brother currently under treatment for coronary artery disease.  Current Medications: The patient is currently on antihypertensives (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide)  aspirin  and a statin for hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin).  Diagnostic Considerations: Due to the patient’s specific demographic characteristics (elderly Caucasian man)  risk factors (smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol)  and presenting symptomatology (severe abdominal pain radiating to his back  pulsing sensation near the navel)  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a high-priority consideration for his diagnosis.   Further investigations such as ultrasound and/or CT scan should be carried out for solidification of the diagnosis and management  including a surgical consult if the diagnosis is confirmed.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,58,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old  Caucasian male  an ex-smoker with a body mass index of 24. He is retired and lives with his wife. The patient reports a mild recurrent lower back and abdominal pain that has persisted over the last few weeks. He does not report any changes in his urinary or bowel habits. His appetite is slightly lower than usual  and he has unintentionally lost a couple of kilos over the past month.  Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension. He is on antihypertensive medication (Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg once daily and Lisinopril 20mg once daily) for the last ten years. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago when diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  now under control with bronchodilators. He reports mild dyspnea upon exertion.   Family History: The patient's father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died due to its rupture. His mother died due to complications related to diabetes. Other than the aforementioned  he does not report any other hereditary or familial diseases.  Social History: The patient does not consume alcohol. He is married and has two adult children. He has been living a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement.  Clinical Examination: Examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. Other physical observations within normal limits.  According to literature  the average age at diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is about 70  and it is more common in males and Caucasians. Risk factors include positive family history  smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerosis  which are all present in the patient's profile. Additionally  COPD is identified to be associated with a higher risk of AAA  possibly due to systemic inflammation or shared risk factors such as smoking.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,59,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year old Caucasian male who presents with a pulsating feeling in his abdomen and lower back pain. He is a former smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. The patient exercises regularly  maintains a balanced diet and has a BMI within the normal range. He is retired and lives with his wife. They have 3 adult sons. The patient does not consume alcohol and has no history of illicit drug use. He mentions that his younger brother passed away in his early 60s due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol which are well controlled with Atenolol and Atorvastatin respectively. He also has COPD  secondary to his long-term smoking history  for which he uses a combination of long-acting bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids. He underwent a screening colonoscopy at the age of 50 and 60 years  both of which were unremarkable. He takes aspirin as cardiovascular prophylaxis on his physician’s advice. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease with his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his mother had strokes in her late 70s.  Problem Statement: The patient presents symptoms of abdominal pulsating feeling and lower back pain  along with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm. His existing history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and long-term smoking further increases the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The goal for this patient is to determine if he has developed an abdominal aortic aneurysm and based on that result provide appropriate evaluation and treatment plan. Physiological measurements  imaging tests  and laboratory tests should be employed to confirm the diagnosis and guide the subsequent medical or surgical intervention.

Recent Symptoms:  Patient came in complaining of a persistent deep  gnawing pain in his lower back that has progressively gotten worse over the past few weeks. The pain doesn't really get better or worse with movement or rest. He also has been feeling a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  though no visible bulge is seen. The pain is unrelated to meals and there are no changes in bowel or bladder habits.  This is a typical demographic representation of a patient with an AAA. The abdominal aortic aneurysm is most commonly seen in white men over the age of 65 who have a history of smoking  high blood pressure  and/or atherosclerosis. Other risk factors include a family history of AAA  high cholesterol  and being overweight or obese. Symptoms are generally absent until rupture or rapid expansion occurs  often described as a deep  constant  and severe abdominal or back pain.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,63,Problem Representation:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain and low back pain for the past few months. The pain is described as a deep  throbbing sensation  primarily centered in the middle of his abdomen and sometimes appearing after a meal. He reports occasional episodes of lightheadedness but no syncope  change in bowel habits  or weight loss. He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a smoker for the last 50 years.  His physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. He has no significant family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) or connective tissue disease.  On further evaluation  the patient reports that the frequency and intensity of pain in the abdomen have increased in the past week. He is highly anxious about his condition  as he has read about the life-threatening nature of abdominal aortic aneurysm online.   This clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   It is important to note from his past medical history that the patient is at a high risk for developing AAA. His age  gender  and white ethnicity are significant risk factors. Additionally  his history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia have likely contributed to the development of the aneurysm. Currently  the patient requires immediate medical attention to rule out the possibility of aortic rupture and referral to a vascular surgeon for consultation on the management of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,64,Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  from the Midwestern United States with an active lifestyle but currently experiencing unexplained  persistent abdominal and back pain.   Demographics: - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian  - Residence: Midwestern United States - Occupation: Retired - Lifestyle: Generally active   Patient History: The patient has a history of smoking for about 40 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. He has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died of stroke at the age of 72 and his older brother has hypertension. The patient himself has been diagnosed with mild hypertension 15 years ago and has been managing it with medication without any major issues.   Medical Presentation: The patient complains of non-localized abdominal pain  which also radiates to the back. The pain has been consistent for the last couple of weeks. He also reported an unexplained weight loss recently  but no change in appetite.   Known Risk Factors: - Old age - Male Sex - History of smoking  - Familial history of cardiovascular disease - Preexisting hypertension - Unexplained weight loss  This is a typical patient representation for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  where the demographic information aligns with the typical high-risk group for AAA - Older  male  Caucasian  history of smoking  and cardiovascular diseases. AAA is more common in males older than 60 and in those who have a history of smoking or vascular disease. This patient's symptoms  demographic features  and history are characteristic of a typical AAA patient  with the pain radiating from the abdomen to the lower back being a key symptom of AAA. Unexplained weight loss may also be associated with AAA and indicates the need for immediate medical attention.   The patient may need to undergo further diagnostic procedures like ultrasound or CT scan to confirm the presence and evaluate the size of the aneurysm. Depending on the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm  management strategies may include watchful waiting  pharmacological management  or surgical intervention.

An ultrasound revealed a 5.3cm bulge or aneurysm in the bottom part of his aorta that passes through the abdomen.   Clinical Factors Highlighted: - Age: The majority of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are older than 60 years. Mr. Doe’s age puts him at risk. - Gender: Men are at a higher risk of developing AAA than women. - Race: Caucasians (or Whites) are more likely to develop AAA than people of other races.  - Smoking: Mr. Doe’s significant smoking history greatly increases his risk of having an AAA. - Hypertension and High Cholesterol: These are risk factors for atherosclerosis  which can result in AAA. - Family history of cardiovascular diseases: This history increases the likelihood of AAA. - Symptoms: The pulsating feeling in the abdomen is often found in AAA cases. - Size of Aneurysm: The size (>5.5cm for men) of Mr. Doe's aneurysm is clinically significant  indicating possible need for surgery.  It should be taken into account that about 75% of AAA cases are asymptomatic and are detected through physical examination or imaging done for other reasons. In symptomatic cases  patients may complain of abdominal or back pain  or a pulsatile abdominal mass. Pain associated with AAA can often radiate to the groin  buttock  or leg on one or both sides.

Long-term hypertension  smoking  high-cholesterol diet may contribute to the increased risk of aneurysm. The patient's symptoms and medical history indicate the potential for a slow-growing abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,69,Patient Profile:  John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian man living in the suburban Midwest of the United States. He's a retired construction worker and a veteran smoker who quit 5 years ago. He's known for enjoying the company of his family  especially his 5 grandchildren  and tinkering with vintage cars in his spare time.   Medical History: Mr. Doe has a medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history  which stopped five years ago. He got diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 10 years back due to smoking. Around a decade ago  his primary care provider found he had diabetes type 2  which he controls with medication and diet. Mr. Doe has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  as his father died due to stroke at the age of 75  and his older brother has coronary artery disease.   Presenting Complaint:  He has recently been complaining of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  occasional lower back pain  and profound fatigue. These symptoms have been increasing gradually over the last few months.  Problem Representation: This is a 72-year-old Caucasian man with multiple risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases  such as a past extensive history of smoking  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and positive family history. He is presenting with a pulsatile feeling in his abdomen  lower back pain  and fatigue. Given these characteristics  there is a suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) which may warrant further investigation.   Relevance: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition  often asymptomatic until rupture occurs. Risk factors include age over 65  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  smoking history  and family history of AAA. This patient fits many of these demographic and clinical characteristics  making AAA a significant concern.   Literature Reference: According to a study published in JAMA  the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged between 65 and 75 with any history of smoking is around 4.5%. Furthermore  the condition tends to be familial and is also strongly associated with male sex  old age  and Caucasian ethnicity. (Svensjö S  Björck M  Wanhainen A.

Examination:  Physical examination discloses a palpable pulsatile mass upon deep palpation in the mid-abdomen  slightly to the left of the midline. There is reduced bilateral femoral pulse  as well as a pronounced abdominal bruit. Overall  the clinical picture is suggestive of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   8. Risk factors: The patient's significant risk factors for AAA include older age  male gender  family history of AAA  hypertension  high cholesterol  and chronic smoking.   This is a representation of a typical patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm built around available literature and studies indicating the common risk factors  co-morbid conditions  and demographic characteristics associated with the problem.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,71,Patient Profile: - Sex: Male - Age: 74 (avg. age for AAA diagnosis is 70 years) - Race: Caucasian (highest prevalence among this race)  Past Medical History: - Chronic hypertension - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - History of tobacco use - Family history of AAA - Blood clotted condition - Previous cardiovascular disease e.g. ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease - Elevated cholesterol levels  Presentation: The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  COPD  tobacco use  familial AAA  blood-clotted condition  previous cardiovascular disease  and high cholesterol. He presents with symptoms of sudden  severe pain in the lower back and abdomen  becoming faint or dizzy  sudden weakness  and fast heart rate. These symptoms are suggestive of a possible rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  This representation is based on the demographic factors and past medical history that are common in patients with AAA. The average age at diagnosis is typically around 70 years  and the condition is more prevalent in men and in Caucasians. Risk factors include hypertension  tobacco use  family history of AAA  and other cardiovascular diseases. The presentation of symptoms can often indicate a rupture  which is a medical emergency. The patient here presents with the most common symptoms of a rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,72,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 70 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired construction worker Location: Urban area Smoking History: Smoker - 40 pack years Family History: No known family history of AAA  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed at age 50  controlled with daily medication. 2. High cholesterol: Diagnosed at age 55  managed with statins. 3. Peripheral arterial disease: Diagnosed at age 65  treated with percutaneous angioplasty  walking program  and antiplatelet medications.  Presenting Complaint:  Episodic abdominal and back pain.  Physical Examination:  Abdominal palpation reveals a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper part of the abdomen. Mild tenderness over the mass. Vital signs are stable.  Diagnostic Evaluation Suggestion:  1. Abdominal Ultrasound scan. 2. Computerized tomography (CT) angiography.  Representation: This 70-year-old Caucasian male  with a significant smoking history  and a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease  presents with episodic abdominal and back pain. Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). According to recent statistics  males over 65 years old  particularly Caucasians  with a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking  are particularly at risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm  making this patient's presentation typical. Proposed next steps would be an abdominal ultrasound scan to confirm the suspicion of an AAA  followed by CT angiography to provide accurate measurements and help with planning for potential surgical intervention. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,73,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 28  indicating overweight status. He is a former smoker with a 40-year pack history  but he ceased tobacco use 5 years ago. He lives alone and is retired  but socially active with a moderate level of physical activity. He consumes alcohol in moderation.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of high blood pressure which has been managed by anti-hypertensive medication for the past 20 years  but not always well controlled. He has been receiving treatment for hyperlipidemia as well. His paternal grandfather and father both had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient reports intermittent  severe abdominal pain and lower back pain over the past few months. He also mentions a pulsating feeling near his navel. There is no history of blood in stool or any changes in bowel habits.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appears anxious. Vital signs are stable. The abdominal inspection shows no visible mass or pulsations. Upon palpation  there seems to be a pulsatile mass in the central abdomen  slightly tender. No bruit is audible on auscultation.  Possible Diagnosis: Based on his symptoms  physical examination  age  sex  ethnic background  family history  smoking history  and hypertension  there is a strong suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This warrants further investigations like ultrasound  CT or MRI for confirmation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,74,Patient Profile:  Gender: Male Age: 68 years old Race/ethnicity: Caucasian  Education level: High school graduate Occupation: Retired construction worker Location: Rural community in the midwestern United States Marital Status: Married  Medical History:  The patient has a positive family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with his father having succumbed to a ruptured AAA at the age of 72. He has been diagnosed with moderate hypertension  with an average blood pressure measurement in the upper 130s/80s  and has been taking anti-hypertensive medication (calcium channel blockers) consistently as well as aspirin for the past 10 years.  He has been a habitual smoker (1 pack/day) since his teens but has been making efforts recently to quit. He occasionally consumes alcohol but in moderate amounts. He maintains a diet borderline high in processed and red meat  low in fiber. Overweight with a BMI of 28  he tries to maintain an active lifestyle with regular cardiovascular exercise  but he also has a history of intermittent lower back pain.  Additionally  the patient has a history of atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial diseases for which he underwent angioplasty around 5 years back. He was told during the course of treatment that these conditions might be indicative of a possibility of an AAA. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and chronic bronchitis.  Symptoms:  Lately  the patient has noticed a pulsating feeling in his abdomen and an occasional sharp pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed at an annual check-up  which yielded suspicions of anabdominal aortic aneurysm.  Based on the confluence of his demographic characteristics  lifestyle  medical history  and recent symptoms  the patient is considered highly at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Immediate attention  evaluation and monitoring is strongly recommended.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,75,Problem Statement:   John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the clinic today complaining of consistent  dull  aching abdominal pain for the past week  which is mostly localized to the middle and lower parts of his abdomen. The pain occasionally radiates to his back. He reports an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last six weeks  despite no evident change in his diet or physical activity level. Mr. Doe has been feeling unusually tired recently and sometimes experiences dizziness. There is no reported history of fever  nausea  vomiting  change in bowel habit  urinary symptoms  or trauma.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  which have been managed with medication for the past 10 years. A pack-a-day smoker  Mr. Doe quit smoking just two years ago after 35 years of tobacco use. There is a significant family history  as his elder brother died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 72.  Social History: Mr. Doe is a retired mechanical engineer. He is married and lives with his wife. He consumes alcohol moderately  approximately 2-3 drinks per week. He denies any illicit drug use. He is physically active with regular participation in a senior walking group three times per week.  Considering his advanced age  male sex  Caucasian ethnicity  past smoking history  family history of AAA  presence of consistent  dull aching abdominal and back pain  and unintentional weight loss  he is at a considerable risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. An immediate diagnostic evaluation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and plan the course of action. Note: AAA occurs most frequently in males over 60yo and among those of Caucasian descent  smokers  and individuals with a family history of AAA. Hypertension and high cholesterol are also common risk factors. However  this is just one typical patient presentation and AAA can occur in individuals outside this description. Also  many AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,76,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker with a history of high blood pressure  high cholesterol  emberoplastic small vessel disease  and familial history of aneurysms. He is experiencing abdominal pain which is persistent and severe. The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and consumes a diet high in fats and cholesterol.   Demographic Characteristics: The patient is a typical representation of the most common demographic diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)  as Caucasians  especially males  are found to have the highest incidence of AAA  especially in those above the age of 65. Being a former smoker is also a significant risk factor for aneurysms. In addition  the patient's history of cardiovascular (hypertension and high cholesterol) and genetic conditions (family history of aneurysms) increase the risk.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which are risk factors for AAA. There is a direct relationship between elevated blood pressure and the risk of aneurysm  and high cholesterol levels contribute to atherosclerosis  which can weaken the aortic wall  predisposing to aneurysm development.   He has emberoplastic small vessel disease  a type of cerebral small vessel disease  that can complicate the condition due to increased cardiovascular risks. The familial history of aneurysm indicates a genetic predisposition to developing AAA.  Lifestyle: The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and consumes a diet high in fats and cholesterol  both of which can contribute to the development and progression of AAA. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are essential in managing cardiovascular health and preventing conditions like AAA.   Symptoms: The patient presents with abdominal pain which can be an indication of a leaking  expanding  or ruptured AAA. It needs immediate medical attention as AAAs can be life-threatening if ruptured.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,77,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking and chronic hypertension.  Presenting Problem: The patient complains of a constant lower back pain and palpitations that have grown worse over a few weeks.  Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 10 years and is currently on antihypertensive medication. The patient has also been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years and recently quit. A family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is noted with his father having the condition and ultimately succumbing due to its rupture. The patient's lipid profile is abnormal  indicating dyslipidemia  and he is presently not taking any treatment for the same. Additionally  the patient is overweight with a BMI of 30.  Relevant Clinical Examinations: A physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the patient's abdomen  besides a routine medical examination.   Diagnostic Tests: Particularly relevant diagnostics include an abdominal ultrasound  which confirms the presence of an aneurysm (~5cm) in the abdominal aorta.   Risk Factors: The patient's age  male gender  history of hypertension  chronic smoking habit  and family history of AAA significantly increases his risk of AAA.   Treatments/therapy: The patient has been treated with standard-sized endovascular stent graft but he needs to continue his antihypertensive medication and engage in lifestyle modifications including maintaining a healthy weight. Since his lipid profile is abnormal  statin therapy is necessary.  Noteworthiness for problem-solving: The confluence of risk factors (age  male gender  chronic smoking  hypertension  family history  high lipid levels  and overweight) could complicate the operative course and postoperative recovery period. The patient’s high-risk profile calls for a comprehensive intervention including medication  surgery  and lifestyle changes to effectively manage his AAA condition and reduce the risk of rupture.

Currently  he is on medication with a beta-blocker for his hypertension and a statin for his high cholesterol. Apart from these  he consumes alcohol occasionally and has a low level of physical activity.   Note: Men  especially those over 65  with a history of smoking and high blood pressure are at most risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A family history of the condition also increases the risk.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,79,Patient Profile:  Patient's Name: John Doe Age: 72 years  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Livelihood: Retired Engineer Location: New York  USA  Marital Status: Married  Clinical Presentation:  John Doe presents with a complaint of constant and severe abdominal pain radiating to his lower back and legs. He has experienced episodes of light-headedness and shortness of breath. He also recently noticed an unusual pulsating sensation in his abdomen.  Past Medical History:  John is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago after 25 years of consuming about 1 pack of cigarettes a day. He has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and moderately high levels of cholesterol for the past two decades. These conditions have been somewhat controlled with a regular medication regimen. John had a heart attack 8 years ago and underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement.   Family History:  His father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 76  which revealed a family history of this condition.  Current Medications:  Taking amlodipine 10mg once daily for hypertension. Also takes a daily low-dose aspirin and atorvastatin 20mg for heart health and cholesterol control.  Alcohol Intake: Limited to social occasions Diet: Balanced diet but struggles with portion control Exercise: Walks daily for about 30 minutes.  Demographic representation has been accomplished accurately where John represents the group at the higher risk for AAA  e.g.  being male  over age 65  and Caucasian. Additionally  his past medical history aligns with the typical risk factors associated with AAA including a smoking history  hypertension  cardiovascular disease  and a family history of the condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,80,Problem Representation:  Demographics:  Patient M.A. is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker with a history of high blood pressure (hypertension).  History of Present Illness:  M.A. presents to the Emergency Department with a complaint of sudden  severe pain in his lower back and belly  which he describes as tearing in nature. The pain started several hours ago  is constant  and does not radiate. He has also experienced episodes of faintness and nausea.  Past Medical History:  M.A. has a long-standing history of hypertension  for which he was prescribed medication  but his compliance has been erratic. He stopped smoking ten years ago  after a 30-year pack-a-day smoking habit. M.A. also has a six-year history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  secondary to smoking. There is no history of diabetes  but an elder brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Review of Systems:  Positive for 10 kg unplanned weight loss over the last 10 months  fatigue and intermittent claudication. He denies chest pain  cough  hemoptysis  vomiting  or changes in bowel movements.  Physical Examination:  A tender  pulsatile mass is palpable in the midline of the abdomen.  Given the age  gender  smoking history  and family history of aortic aneurysm  this patient is at high risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The palpable abdominal mass and symptomatic presentation with acute onset of severe pain  faintness  and nausea increase the suspicion for a rapidly expanding or ruptured aneurysm  necessitating urgent diagnostic confirmation and management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,81,Patient Profile:  Name: John Smith Age: 71 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Military Officer Smoking History: Yes  45 pack-years  Medical History and Details:  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset severe abdominal and lower back pain.   History of Present Illness: Mr. Smith has been experiencing occasional and moderate abdominal and back pain for about a week. Today  he presented with a sudden onset of severe abdominal and lower back pain that's continually worsening. He also mentions shortness of breath and feeling faint.   Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 12 years ago  controlled on medication. 2. High cholesterol: Diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled with statins. 3. Smoking history: Smoked 1.5 packs daily for about 30 years (45 pack-years)  quit smoking around 10 years ago.   Family History:  1. Father died of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 68 2. Mother has Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  Review of Systems:  1. Cardiovascular – Positive for palpitations  chest discomfort  and shortness of breath. 2. Respiratory – Positive for dyspnea.  3. Gastrointestinal – Positive for abdominal pain.  Physical Examination:  Blood Pressure: 155/95 mmHg  Pulse rate: 110 beats per minute  irregular  Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute  Temperature: 98.6F.   Focused abdominal exam reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. He has tenderness in his abdomen and lower back.   Based on the literature  men aged 65-75 years who have ever smoked are considered high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mr. Smith's age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history all place him into the high-risk category. His presenting symptoms are suggestive of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). His case is worrying given it may be indicating a rupture of the AAA  a serious  life-threatening condition. Further diagnosis needs to be done immediately to determine the location and size of the aneurysm and plan potential interventions. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,82,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Sex: Male - Age: In his late 70s - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired (previous jobs demanding physical labor  common in older demographics)  Presenting Complaint: The patient has presented complaining of consistent  deep  and severe pain in his lower back or the side of his abdomen. Alongside the pain  he has experienced episodes of lightheadedness and syncope.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Current Smoker: He has been a regular smoker throughout his adult life  averaging a pack a day.  - Cardiovascular Diseases: The patient has a recorded history of high blood pressure which he manages with prescription medication. Also  there has been a history of peripheral artery disease.  - Familiar History: His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm and underwent surgical repair in his late 70s. His older brother also has an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  - Prior Surgeries: Prostatectomy performed 5 years earlier due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.     Lifestyle:  His lifestyle is relatively sedentary  limited physical activity and is often isolated due to living alone. His diet lacks significant nutrients as it has a heavy reliance on easy to make processed foods.   Given the patient's age  sex  race  familial history  and personal history of cardiovascular disease  he falls into an accurate demographic representation for those at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His symptoms suggest a possible rupture or imminent rupture  necessitating immediate action.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,83,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: White male  aged 70 years  retired military official  married - Personal habits: Smoker (25-pack year history)  regular moderate alcohol consumer - Family History: Father died at 68 due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Mother has hypertension and a history of stroke. Sister diagnosed with coronary artery disease.   Past Medical History:  - Hypertension for the past ten years  maintained on medication (Lisinopril) - Moderate hyperlipidemia  under statin therapy (Atorvastatin) - Previous diagnoses of peripheral artery disease  treated with low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel - Has obesity (BMI 32) and Type 2 diabetes  managed with diet modifications and Metformin - Had inguinal hernia repair twenty years back - No history of cancer or autoimmune disease  Presenting complaint:  - Patient presents complaining of intermittent abdominal pain that extends to the lower back  noticed over the past three months. Severity seems to be increasing in the last few days. - No associated symptoms of altered bowel habit  blood in stool  fever  or weight loss. - In the clinic  the examiner notes a pulsating mass in the patient’s abdomen.  This representation is based on the fact that abdominal aortic aneurysm is most common in males  around 65-75 years of age  and in those having a family history of the condition. Smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  peripheral vascular disease  obesity  and diabetes are also commonly associated conditions with AAA. Furthermore  AAA symptoms often include abdominal and lower back pain  with a pulsating mass in the abdomen commonly noticed on examination.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,84,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient comes to the clinic with abdominal pain and lower back pain. He reports his blood pressure is typically on the high side (hypertensive). He also has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day (heavy smoker) for the past 45 years but quit smoking two years ago. The patient says he has been limiting his tobacco use but hadn't entirely quit until recently. He has been also having periodic episodes of rapid heartbeats (tachycardia). His family reports that he has progressively lost weight over the past few months  although he was not dieting or exercising to lose weight.  Past Medical History: In addition to hypertension and a history of heavy tobacco use  the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 10 years ago for triple vessel disease. A myocardial infarction (heart attack) was experienced 5 years ago. He has not had any peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular accidents. He has not undergone any abdominal or aortic surgeries in the past.

The pain seems to be constant and is unchanged with movement/position.  Demographic Information: Mr. Thompson is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who lives alone in an urban area. He is a retired mechanical engineer and served in the military when he was younger. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day for about 50 years.  Medical History: He has a history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension and COPD. For the cardiovascular disease  he has been prescribed beta-blockers  and for hypertension  he is on ACE inhibitors. He also takes bronchodilators for his COPD. He had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 4 years ago. He has a significant history of cholesterol for which he takes statins.  Family History: His father died due to a stroke at 78 years old. His mother is alive with Parkinson's disease. His younger brother died at 65 due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has two children from his only marriage  both of whom are healthy.  Clinical Findings: During physical examination  the physician palpated a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. There is no traumatic injury noted. Lumbar spine is normal with no related pathology.  Social History: He has been widowed for 3 years now. He is relatively inactive with little exercise and has a high-fat diet. He has no history of drug use or alcoholism.  Summarizing the case  a 72-year-old white male presents with severe abdominal and back pain. He has a significant smoking history and suffers from cardiovascular disease  hypertension  COPD and hyperlipidemia. His family history includes a brother who died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Current physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in his abdomen.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,86,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: John Doe  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  presents with vague lower back pain which he describes as a deep  pulsating feel that has been occurring for the past few weeks. Mr. Doe denies having any pain elsewhere or any other significant symptoms.  Demographics: Given the overall prevalence and demographic trends noted in the literature  Mr. Doe falls into the high-risk category for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The condition generally affects males more than females and the risk increases with age  specifically seen amongst individuals who are above 65 years of age. It has also been indicated that Caucasian individuals are at higher risk for developing the condition than other racial or ethnic groups.  Relevant Medical History: Mr. Doe has a past medical history of atherosclerosis and has been a smoker for approximately 45 years  although he insists he has cut down and currently smokes up to 5 cigars a day. Due to the atherosclerosis  his LDL-cholesterol levels have been high (190 mg/dL)  and he was advised to follow-up regularly with his primary care physician. He was also put on a low dose of statins last year. He has mild hypertension that is managed by an ACE inhibitor  but he admits not being very compliant with his medication. He does not have diabetes  kidney disease  or peripheral artery disease. His family history is significant for his father who died from a stroke at the ripe age of 75  and his grandfather who apparently died from a ‘ruptured artery’.  Mentioned Risk Factors: Advanced age  Caucasian race  male sex  history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol (atherosclerosis)  and potential familial predisposition.   Problem Hypothesized: Abdominal aortic aneurysm is potentially suspected due to the patient’s specific general condition  persistent lower back pain  demographic profile  risk factors  and medical history. There is a strong need for immediate diagnostic evaluation to confirm or rule out the risk of a looming lethal event such as an aneurysm rupture. Clinic scenario as such warrants relevant further diagnostic tests  e.g.  an ultrasound scan or a CT scan of the abdomen.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,87,Problem Representation:  A 70-year-old male patient presents with a sudden onset of severe and persistent pain in the lower back and abdominal region. The pain is knife-like and pulsating in nature. He also reported signs of experiencing lightheadedness and rapid heart rate.   Demographic Characterization:  The patient is a Caucasian male  keeping in line with demographic data indicating that abdominal aortic aneurysms are most common in this racial group. His age of 70 aligns with the significant presence of the condition in those aged 65 and older.  Patient History:  The patient has a history of heavy smoking  pharmacologically controlled hypertension  and high cholesterol levels. Both these conditions are risk factors for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is also a family history of aortic aneurysms  which increases the patient's risk.  Upon physical examination  he appears distressed due to pain. His abdomen is noted to be rigid and slightly distended. A pulsating mass is felt upon palpation in the upper abdominal region  possibly indicating the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   The patient's health has been stable for a good part of his life except for his managed hypertension and high cholesterol levels. He has a history of regularly following up at the clinic for his chronic medical conditions. He has been vaccinated for Influenza and Pneumonia. He is reasonably well-nourished and lives with his wife in their home.  Post-emergency surgical intervention for the abdominal aortic aneurysm  the patient's progress will need to be monitored. Long-term management of his hypertension and high cholesterol levels will need to be adjusted accordingly. Smoking cessation counseling will also need to be escalated to remove this risk factor. Yearly screening for aortic aneurysm will be mandated given his family history of aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,88,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Name: John Doe Age: 70 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired plumber Marital Status: Married Insurance: Medicare  Medical History: Presenting complaint: Mr. Doe visited the clinic complaining of constant and severe abdominal pain radiating to his back which has been gradually intensifying for the last 2 to 3 days. He also mentioned episodic mild dizziness over the past week.   Past medical history: He had been diagnosed with Hypertension 12 years ago which is currently managed with Lisinopril. He has a 45-pack year history of smoking but quit smoking a year ago after being diagnosed with COPD.

Medications: He is on Lisinopril for Hypertension and Albuterol sulfate inhaler for COPD.  Physical examination: He is a well-proportioned elderly man who appears distressed due to pain. His abdomen is pulsatile and tender in the mid to lower abdominal area.  Diagnostic impression: The presenting symptoms in association with the patient's age  sex  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease point towards the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Final problem representation: A 70-year-old retired male with a history of hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant smoking history presents with severe abdominal pain with back radiation. The differential diagnosis includes the important consideration of abdominal aortic aneurysm given the risk factors and presenting symptoms.  This representation allows for a more detailed and systematic assessment of the patient's issue while taking into account demographic characteristics and pertinent history that are relevant for the diagnosis  management  and prognosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,89,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 73 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  Relevant Past Medical History: - Smoking history (quit smoking 10 years ago but had been a heavy smoker for almost 40 years) - Diagnosed with high blood pressure 20 years ago (managed with prescribed drugs) - High cholesterol (prescribed statins) - History of COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) - No known allergies  Presenting Complaints: - Complained about constant back pain and abdominal discomfort for the past few weeks - Unexplained weight loss - Loss of appetite  occasional nausea - Brief episodes of rapid heartbeat  Clinical Examination: - Pulsatile mass palpable in the abdomen - Increased heart rate (tachycardia) - Blood Pressure: 160/95 mm Hg - Paleness  Based on this representation  the doctor would consider the probability of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the differential diagnosis due to the patient's history of smoking  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol  as well as the mentioned symptoms and physical exam findings. An ultrasound or CT scan may be ordered to further investigate. This patient representation accurately reflects the literature  where men  particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity  aged above 65  with a history of vascular risk factors (like smoking and hypertension)  are at a heightened risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Preliminary diagnosis:  - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  This problem representation incorporates high risk factors for AAA including male gender  advanced age  Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history. The presence of persistent uncontrolled hypertension and history of atherosclerosis contribute to the likelihood of AAA. The patient’s presentation with sudden abdominal pain and evidence of a pulsatile abdominal mass on physical examination further allows health professionals to suspect Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,91,Patient Profile:  **Patient Information** - Name: John Doe - Age: 73 years old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired military officer - Marital Status: Widowed - Smoking History: 50 pack years  quit 5 years ago - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate  3-4 times a week - Recreational Drug Use: None  **Presenting Problem** John is complaining of uncharacteristic back pain and abdominal discomfort  which he initially believed might be related to old age or arthritis. He mentioned feeling a pulsating sensation around the navel area when laying flat on his back. The pain is continuous  dull and not associated with meals or physical activity.   **Past Medical History** - High blood pressure for 20 years  on medication - Diagnosed with high cholesterol 10 years ago  controlled with statins - History of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed 7 years ago - Had a heart stroke 5 years ago  on aspirin for secondary prevention - Undergone coronary artery bypass surgery 6 years ago  **Family History** - Father passed away due to heart attack at age 70 - Mother  age 90 alive with dementia - Two elder sisters (76 and 79) both with high blood pressure  elder sister had a heart attack at age 70 - No siblings or parent with the history of aneurysm  **Physical examination** On examination  his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/90 mmHg  heart rate was regular at 78 beats per minute. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass around the navel.  **Assessment** Based on the patient's age  sex  risk factors (hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking history  PAD)  family history  and symptoms  there is a high suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  **Plan** Order a CT scan or ultrasound to confirm diagnosis  and depending on the size and patient's condition  discuss surgical or endovascular intervention options for the AAA.  This presentation depicts a common scenario for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is more prevalent in the elderly male population  and particularly in those with a history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking  and Caucasian ethnicity. Family history of AAA slightly increases the risks. AAA is often asymptomatic but can manifest as unexplained abdominal or back pain  or a pulsatile abdominal mass.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,92,Patient Problem Representation:  Patient: Mr. Gibbs  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting problem: The patient has been complaining of constant severe pain in his lower back and abdomen. He has also described experiencing a pulsing sensation in his abdomen.  Signs and Symptoms: Significant abdominal pain  pulsating abdominal mass  tenderness in abdomen  back pain  pulse distal to the aneurysm may be decreased.  Past Medical History: Longstanding history of hypertension  30-year-history of tobacco use (two packs of cigarettes daily)  was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 10 years ago and has been under medication since then. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. Mr. Gibbs was treated 5 years ago for a myocardial infarction. He denies any allergic reactions.  Examination Findings: Vital signs are BP 165/85  Pulse 95  Temp 98.6 F  RR 18  Oxygen Saturation 96% on room air. Examination reveals a pulsating abdominal mass  about 5 cm in diameter.   Investigations: Chest X-ray shows calcification of the aortic knob. Abdominal ultrasound reveals an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta measuring 5.5 cm. Complete blood count  renal function tests  and electrolyte studies are normal.   Demographics: Lives alone and is retired. He is not physically active and does not adhere to a healthy diet. He consumes alcohol socially. He denies use of illicit drugs.  In conclusion  these symptoms  along with the patient's age  race  long history of smoking  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia and a family history of cardiovascular diseases  particularly AAA  the presence of a pulsating abdominal mass and pertinent imaging findings suggest a strong possibility of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,93,Problem Representation:  Patient Characterization:  Mr. Thomas is a 71-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with complaints of constant  severe pain in the lower back and mid-abdominal area. Height is approximated to 6 feet  with a weight of 85 kg  bringing his BMI to 25.5  indicating he is slightly overweight. Consequently  he suffers from obesity. He also complains of occasional leg pains  which other doctors have attributed to peripheral artery disease over time. He is a retired banker  an active smoker since his mid-40s  and has a moderate drinking habit.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thomas has a well-documented past medical history. He was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol 15 years ago and has been under treatment since then. Both of these conditions have been fairly well controlled with medications. His medical records also reveal that he had undergone cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease 10 years ago. He currently takes a daily aspirin  statins for high cholesterol  and antihypertensive medications.  Family History:  His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  and his older brother was recently diagnosed with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Relevant Literature:  According to literature  the typical patient suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is often an older male  aged around 65-75 years old. AAA is also found more commonly in Caucasians than in other racial or ethnic groups. The presence of other cardiovascular diseases  especially hypertension and high cholesterol  is common with AAA. Moreover  AAA has a strong genetic component  which is evidenced by the positive family history in this case.   Smoking  which is another significant risk factor for AAA  is also present in Mr. Thomas. As with most cases of AAA  he did not exhibit any noticeable symptoms until the aneurysm grew large; this aligns with the characteristic silent growth of AAA. The pain he now experiences may be indicative of the aneurysm being at the risk of rupture  which is a dangerous complication of this condition. The presence of peripheral artery disease further escalates the risk for cardiovascular events.   Since obesity can lead to hypertension and high cholesterol  Mr. Thomas’s weight can be considered as an additional risk factor contributing to AAA in his case. Alcohol consumption  although not a direct risk factor  can contribute indirectly to cardiovascular diseases  thereby affecting AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,94,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  A 70-year-old male Caucasian patient  former smoker. Lives in a suburban area  has a history of moderate alcohol consumption  and is overweight (BMI 29). Additionally  he works as a retired engineer and is a veteran.   Chief Complaint: He presents with occasional mild-to-moderate abdominal discomfort. He has no history of diabetes or hypertension but does have a significant cardiovascular disease history  having  survived a heart attack six years ago.   Medical History: According to the patient records  he quit smoking five years ago but smoked for roughly 50 years. He underwent a cardiac angioplasty post-myocardial infarction. He has been on a statin (Lipitor) and a daily aspirin since his heart attack. No history of any respiratory diseases. The patient admits to a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity and a diet high in fats and carbohydrates. He confirmed a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father passed away due to a heart attack  and his elder brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Social and Psychosocial History: The patient lives with his wife. He is retired from a stressful job. He denies any illicit drug use. He enjoys playing cards with his friends usually once a week. The patient mentions that he often feels anxious about his health.   Observations: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable in the abdomen.   Investigations: Further studies including ultrasonography or CT scan can identify the abdominal aortic aneurysm size  location and risk of rupture. His lipid profile  renal function and other appropriate blood tests should be conducted as well to account for his underlying cardiovascular disease.   Note: This is a typical example of a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm demographics. Males  especially Caucasians  aged over 65 years  having a history of smoking and/or cardiovascular diseases have the highest risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Other risk factors include a family history  high cholesterol levels  and a history of heart or peripheral vascular diseases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,95,Problem Representative: Mr. David Thompson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented at the emergency department complaining of severe and persisting pain in the middle and lower part of his abdomen and back  with a feeling of pounding near his navel. He is a retired naval officer  married  with two adult children. He resides in the suburbs of Boston  Massachusetts.  His past medical history reveals that he was a smoker for 30 years  consuming a pack a day  but has quit 10 years ago. He has uncontrolled hypertension for the last 20 years and has type 2 diabetes for over 15 years  both of which he manages with medications. He also underwent a surgical procedure for peripheral artery disease around 5 years ago. He has a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms as his paternal grandfather suffered from a ruptured AAA.   Mr. Thompson has been experiencing occasional chest pain and fatigue for a couple of months that he recently mentioned to his primary health service provider. His last physical examination which was about 6 months ago was satisfactory  at which time his body mass index was 28. His recent blood lipid profile showed slightly elevated triglycerides and LDLs  and he is currently following a low cholesterol diet plan.  He was found unconscious by his wife following the onset of symptoms and was rushed to the hospital. Triage was performed timely and he was resuscitated. Based on his clinical presentation and history  an emergency computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was ordered which confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,96,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:  - Age: An elderly man  around 70 years old - Gender: Male  - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retiree - Weight: Slightly overweight with the Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27 - Lifestyle: Former smoker who quit 10 years ago  drinks alcohol occasionally  Presenting Problem:  The patient has come to the clinic complaining of severe lower back pain that has been progressively getting worse over the past few days. The pain is not related to any movement or physical activity and it is constant. He has also been feeling increasingly fatigued and has somewhat reduced appetite. He hasn't noticed any changes in his urine or bowel movements  but occasionally felt heart palpitations.  Past Medical History:  Present illness:  - Previous history of hypertension for the past 15 years managed with antihypertensive medication - Dyslipidemia managed with statins. - Quit smoking 10 years ago  after 30 years of a pack-a-day habit - No previous surgeries or hospital admissions.  Family History:  - His father died at 75 from a stroke  mother died at 80 due to heart disease - His older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at 72.  In addition to his presenting symptoms and notable family history  the patient’s age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  and dyslipidemia all make him a high-risk candidate for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,97,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characterization: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  lifelong smoker with an average socioeconomic status. The patient lives alone and is fairly sedentary in his lifestyle.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a recent history of intermittent  dull pain in the abdomen and lower back. He has also reported unintended weight loss over the past few months.   Past Medical History: The patient has a relevant past medical history of high blood pressure for which he takes medication. He has a 50-year history of smoking and quit 10 years ago. He has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and is currently on statin therapy. His father died due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Literature Data: Demographic data from clinical research indicates that abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more frequently in men than in women  are most common in people aged 65 and older. They are more common in white people than in people of other races. A family history of aortic aneurysms often means an increased risk and the presence of other vascular aneurysms is usually an indication. Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk  especially for men  and the risk diminishes after around 5-10 years of having quit smoking. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also key risk factors.   Problem: Given the patient’s demographic profile  his past medical history  and presenting symptoms  there is a potential indication of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The problem is further underscored by his advanced age  gender  long-term history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and his family history of aortic aneurysms. The pain in the abdomen and back  coupled with unexplained weight loss are common symptoms associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Immediate medical attention is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and decide upon the most suitable course of treatment.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,98,Problem Representation:  Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with some lower back pain and a pulsating feeling around his lower naval. He was a long-time smoker and quit 10 years ago but he continues to drink alcohol occasionally. He acknowledges an ongoing battle with obesity with his BMI remaining above 30 for the last 15 years. His medical history includes hypertension for which he has been taking medication for the past 7 years; however  his blood pressure has often been poorly controlled. He also has a history of high cholesterol and has been on statins for over a decade. He underwent angioplasty about 6 years ago due to coronary artery disease.   His family history is notable for his father  who passed away from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture in his late 70s. In terms of social history  he is a retired mechanical engineer who lives with his wife of 48 years. He has two adult children and four grandchildren. He admits to not getting as much exercise as he ought to and this has aggravated the discomfort in his back and abdomen.  This case presentation is typical as the incidence of AAA is more common in males over the age of 65 and in those of Caucasian descent. Multiple risk factors are present such as advanced age  a history of smoking  obesity  high blood pressure  high blood cholesterol  and a family history of AAA. Moreover  AAA is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during imaging for other indications  but in this case  patient is presenting with common symptoms associated with AAA such as lower back pain and pulsating feeling in the lower naval region.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,99,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of long-term smoking and high blood pressure. He is retired and lives with his wife in a suburban area. He has a BMI of 28  suggestive of being overweight but does not have any known food allergies. It is known that he drinks alcohol occasionally  maintaining a limit of 2 glasses of wine a day.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension for 20 years  controlled with Lisinopril. His lipid profile shows mildly raised cholesterol levels  being treated with Atorvastatin. He has no significant surgical history. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having succumbed to a myocardial infarction  and his elder brother had surgical repair for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history but quit smoking 10 years ago.   Presenting Problem: The patient has recently started experiencing a constant  dull ache in the abdominal region  sometimes radiating to the lower back. The pain  initially mild  has gradually increased in intensity over the last couple of weeks. He has also complained of feeling unusually fatigued recently. He denies any recent trauma  fever  changes in bowel habits  or genitourinary symptoms. When seen in his primary care clinic  an abdominal mass is palpated and is noted as pulsatile.  Synthesis: Given the patient's age  sex  history of long-term smoking  hypertension  family history of AAA  and presenting symptoms of unexplained and persistent abdominal pain  the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is high. Further imaging tests such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan will be required for confirmation.  Literature Support: The demographic details and characteristics outlined here are consistent with existing literature which identifies older age  male gender  Caucasian race  smoking  and family history as the most significant risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The presentation of abdominal or back pain  coupled with a palpable abdominal mass  is also consistent with the typical presentation of advanced AAA cases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,6,100,Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint:  69-year-old male presented with a sudden onset of severe pain in the lower back area  radiating to the buttocks and thighs.   Demographic Information:  The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  who is retired and lives with his wife. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for 30 years. He consumes alcohol occasionally. His BMI is 29  which puts him in the overweight category.   Previous Medical History:   The patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and hyperlipoproteinemia. He has been on anti-hypertensive medications and statins for the past 10 years. His father died of a heart attack in his mid-70s  and his mother died of stroke at age 80. His older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair at age 72.  Review of Systems: The patient has been feeling tired for the past few days. He reported constipation  poor appetite  and occasional dizziness. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or changes in urinary frequency or volume.   Physical Examination:   On physical examination  the patient appeared in pain but not distressed. His vital signs were within normal limits except for a mildly elevated blood pressure at 140/90 mm Hg. His abdomen was soft and non-tender  but a pulsatile mass was palpable in the periumbilical area. Peripheral pulses were present and symmetrical in lower limbs.   Preliminary Diagnosis:  Given the patient's age  past smoking history  family history of AAA  and the presentation of sudden severe lower back pain with a palpable pulsatile mass in the abdomen  the preliminary diagnosis is an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,1,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an 80-year-old Male Non-smoker with Comorbidities: A Case Report  Case Presentation:   The patient is an 80-year-old male non-smoker with a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He is of Caucasian descent and retired military personnel who lives a predominantly sedentary lifestyle in a suburban setting.  His medications consist of metformin  lisinopril  and simvastatin. He is compliant with his medications and has good follow-up with his primary care physician and endocrinologist. He does not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. He doesn't have any known family history of aortic aneurysms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe  sudden-onset  tearing abdominal and back pain radiating to the lower extremities. In addition to the pain  the patient was experiencing concomitant symptoms of light-headedness  nausea  and profuse sweating. His vital signs on arrival were notably for tachycardia and hypotension.  Investigations:  A bedside abdominal ultrasound was done which revealed abdominal aortic dilatation measuring 6.5 cm. His blood work was remarkable for leukocytosis  elevated levels of serum creatinine  and lactic acid reflecting systemic inflammatory response and renal impairment.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s presentation and ultrasound findings  the diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was made.  Treatment:  He was immediately taken to the operating room where a vascular surgeon performed an emergent open repair of the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Postoperatively  the patient was managed in intensive care unit (ICU). His recovery was complicated by ongoing renal impairment and required temporary hemodialysis. He also developed pneumonia  but it was managed with antibiotics and respiratory support. After a total of 3 weeks in the ICU  he was transferred to the general vascular surgery ward. His recovery was slow but progressive  with improved kidney function that avoided long-term dialysis.  Discussion:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a condition that is more common in males  particularly those over the age of 65. The main risk factors include smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of aneurysms. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia put him at risk. Surprisingly  this case was found in a non-smoker patient  emphasizing the importance of bearing in mind the condition even in patients atypical of a classic AAA demographic.  Learning Points:  1. Early recognition and prompt intervention are critical for survival in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2. Always consider AAA in the differential in patients over the age of 65 presenting with severe abdominal pain  even if they don't fit the typical profile (smoker). 3. Emphasize the significant importance of managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia in preventing AAA in at-risk populations. 4. Multi-disciplinary team approach involving primary care  endocrinology  intensive care unit and vascular surgery teams are crucial in the management of such complex patients.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,2,Patient Initials: J.D. Gender: Male Age: 72 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Presenting Problem: Dull abdominal pain  Managerial History: J.D.  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  was brought to the emergency department presenting with dull  consistent lower abdominal pain that started approximately a day ago. The patient stated that the pain also radiates to the back. In his assessment  he rated his pain as a seven on a scale of zero to ten. J.D. was not experiencing any other symptoms such as fever  vomiting  diarrhea  or chest pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he is currently taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily and Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily. J.D. used to smoke a pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but quit smoking 5 years ago. He admits to occasional alcohol use.  Family History: His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 78  and his mother passed away from a stroke at 80. His younger brother is alive at 65 and has a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. J.D.'s blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  and heart rate was 82 beats per minute. No renal bruits were heard on auscultation. The rest of the examination  including chest  cardiovascular  and neurological  was unremarkable.  Investigations: A computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the abdomen was ordered  which confirmed an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was 5.5 cm in diameter. No signs of rupture or leak were present.   Management and Follow-up: The patient was admitted for surgical consult and then had an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) due to the large size of the aneurysm. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged 2 days after surgery and advised to quit alcohol entirely  continue his current medications  have regular follow-ups with the vascular surgeon  and get an ultrasound of the abdomen in 6 months.   Clinical Reasoning: The male gender  older age  history of smoking  the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and hyperlipidemia) make J.D. more predisposed to developing AAA. The lack of symptoms  such as leg pain  decrease in pulses  or skin changes  excludes peripheral arterial disease. The normal and unremarkable chest and cardiovascular examination support the abdominal origin of the pain  narrowing down to a possible AAA. The pulsatile abdominal mass further supports the suspicion of AAA. The diagnostic imaging confirmed the presence of a large AAA  which required surgical intervention.   Discussion: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially serious condition with a higher prevalence in men  especially those over 65 and with a history of smoking  hypertension and hyperlipidemia. AAA  unless ruptured  typically remains asymptomatic and may be discovered incidentally on physical examination or radiological studies performed for unrelated reasons. However  once the aneurysm ruptures  it may present with severe pain  frank shock  or death. Timely diagnosis and intervention are critical in managing this condition. The case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical examination  prompt diagnosis  and appropriate management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,3,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Male  INTRODUCTION:  We report a case of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) identified incidentally in a 68-year-old Caucasian male during a routine medical examination.   CASE PRESENTATION:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented for his annual check-up with no specific complaints. He is retired  previously worked in construction  is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. His medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which had been controlled with medication (atenolol 50mg daily and atorvastatin 20mg nightly) for the last eight years. Family history was significant for a brother who had an AAA repair at age 70.  On physical examination  his vital signs were stable - blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  pulse rate 72 beats per minute  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 98% on room air  and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiopulmonary examination was overall unremarkable. On abdominal examination  a visible pulsatile mass with an expansile pattern was noted in the peri-umbilical region. No tenderness  distension  or signs of peritonitis were elicited.  On suspicion of AAA  the patient was referred for an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed an infrarenal AAA with a maximal diameter of 5.5cm. No signs of rupture or dissection were observed.   DISCUSSION:  The patient was diagnosed with an asymptomatic AAA. Despite the normal blood pressure readings  it was decided to further lower the target blood pressure to reduce the pressure load on the aneurysm wall  and the dose of atenolol was increased to 75mg daily. Concurrently  the patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation considering the aneurysm diameter of >5cm  advanced age  and family history of AAA.  In line with the current guidelines endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery  he was scheduled for an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The patient was informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and he consented to it.  CONCLUSION:  In this case  the patient was asymptomatic and his AAA was found incidentally during a routine medical check-up. This underlines the importance of physical examination and raises awareness of AAA in older male patients with risk factors. Primary care physicians should be vigilant and consider referring such patients for screening abdominal ultrasound. This patient’s care was managed according to current guidelines  highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,4,Title: Symptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Senior Hispanic Male: A Case Report   Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are a common vascular disease in older adults and are often asymptomatic until rupture. It is prevalent in 5-10% of men over 65 years of age and is more common in Caucasians when compared to other racial/ethnic groups. This case report describes the unusual case of a symptomatic AAA in a senior Hispanic male.   Case Presentation: Patient Information: Mr. Q  a 73-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of sharp  sudden-onset back  and abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting for a duration of one day. The patient  a retired auto-mechnaic from New Mexico  lives with his wife. He is an ex-smoker with a 30-pack-year history and quit 5 years ago. He has a history of hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is on medication (lisinopril 20mg/day and clopidogrel 75mg/day  respectively). There is no known family history of AAA or vascular diseases.   Clinical Findings: On examination  his blood pressure was elevated at 170/90 mmHg  his heart rate was 96 beats per minute  and his respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. An abdominal examination showed a non-tender but pulsating mass in the midline of his abdomen. There was no distension or rigidity on palpation. There were no signs of peripheral embolization.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan which revealed a fusiform AAA with a maximum diameter of 6.8cm  with no sign of rupture. His complete blood count  coagulation profile and renal function were within normal limits. His urine analysis was also normal  excluding urinary tract infection as a source of his abdominal discomfort.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the size of the aneurysm and symptoms  the patient was referred for urgent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Written informed consent was obtained for EVAR  and the procedure was conducted successfully without complications.  Follow-up and outcome: The patient was discharged on post-procedure day 5 with prescriptions for antibiotics and analgesics. Follow-up post 6-weeks and 3-months showed reduction in AAA size  with no endoleak or complications. The patient reported no abdominal or back pain and was satisfied with the treatment.  Patient Perspective: Mr. Q expressed gratitude for the care provided by the hospital team and stressed the importance of regular follow-ups for preventing potential health issues.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and timely decision making in managing an infrequent case of symptomatic AAA in a senior Hispanic male  emphasizing the need for population-specific to enhance early detection and treatment of AAA.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,5,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Aging Female Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are commonly seen in males over the age of 65 and is highly associated with a history of smoking  high blood pressure  and atherosclerosis. Although it is less common in females  AAA can be fatal when undetected or untreated  often leading to rupture. We describe the case of a 75-year-old Caucasian female who presented with symptoms of a ruptured AAA.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 75-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal and back pain. She is a non-smoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle. Her family history revealed that her father died of an aneurysm rupture at the age of 83.  An initial physical examination identified a pulsatile abdominal mass  with a reduced blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Laboratory test showed an elevated white blood cell count  hinting towards signs of infection or inflammation. A CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of an AAA with a diameter of 7.5 cm  indicating a high risk for rupture.   Treatment: Due to her critical presentation and the size of the aneurysm  an emergency open surgical repair was performed. The surgery was successful  and her aneurysm was repaired with a Dacron graft. Postoperative recovery was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to the significant risk of complications from the surgery.   Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient experienced a steady recovery for two weeks in ICU before being moved to a less intensive ward. Throughout the recovery  she had a constant check on vital signs  aneurysm graft patency  and signs of systemic complications. Six months after the surgery  the patient is doing well  with regular follow-ups highlighting no signs of graft complications.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the presentation of AAA in an elderly female  a cohort typically underrepresented in AAA cases. Timely diagnosis and emergency surgical intervention were decisive in preventing a fatal rupture. Furthermore  this report emphasizes the importance of screening for AAA  especially in older patients with risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  irrespective of gender. Further research is needed to understand AAA's gendered demographic disparities to improve screening and prevent complications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,6,Case Report: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information  A 74-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with acute-onset  severe abdominal pain. The patient reported the intensity of the pain as increasing rapidly within the span of several hours. The pain was centralized in the lower abdominal region and radiating to his back. Alongside  he also reported feeling lightheaded  with an episode of syncope just before arriving at the hospital.  Medical History  The patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a smoking history of 30 pack-years. He was on antihypertensive medicines (Lisinopril and Amlodipine) and a statin (Atorvastatin). However  he had been inconsistent on his medications and had poor compliance with follow-up medical appointments. He denied prior knowledge of the existence of an abdominal mass  decrease in appetite  or weight loss.  Family history was notable for cardiovascular diseases; both his father and older brother succceeded to a myocardial infarction in their late 60s. The patient  however  denied any previous surgical procedures or any known allergies.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared in severe distress  was pale  diaphoretic  and had a fast but weak pulse. His blood pressure was 97/55 mmHg and his heart rate was 110 beats per minute.  Abdominal examination revealed a tender pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen that was not previously known. Urgent blood tests showed a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 24.8%  suggestive of potential internal bleeding.  Diagnosis  Intervention  and Outcome  Given the patient’s history  physical exam findings  and low hemoglobin  an emergent CT scan was carried out which confirmed the diagnosis of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); 7.5 cm in diameter and involving the iliac arteries bilaterally.   The patient was immediately taken to the operating room where an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was successfully performed. Post-operatively  he was managed in intensive care unit.   The immediate post-operative period was uneventful  and his condition improved steadily. He was subsequently transferred to a general ward and was discharged home one week later on adequate antihypertensives and statin therapy  with appointments scheduled for regular follow-up care.  Discussion  AAA is a common and catastrophic condition  with the incidence being particularly high among elderly males  smokers  and those with a history of cardiovascular disease  similar to this presented case. This case report illustrates prompt recognition and management of a ruptured AAA  even in patients with no prior diagnosis.  The risks associated with poor medical compliance are also highlighted  reminding of the pivotal role of medical follow-up and adherence to reduce complications related to chronic conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,7,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Case Presentation:  Mr. A.  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  was brought into the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe pain in the middle of his abdomen that had started progressing towards his back. The patient’s vital signs included a blood pressure of 98/62 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He reported that the pain began after doing some heavy lifting in his garage earlier in the day.  Patient's History:  Mr. A. has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack year smoking history. He had quit smoking approximately 10 years prior to presentation. The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  as his father died of a stroke at the age of 74  and an elder brother had suffered from a heart attack at the age of 65. The patient was not on any regular medication except for occasional over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for arthritis pain.   Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was noted in the abdomen. Further investigation with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.5 cm in maximum diameter.   Treatment and Outcome:  Following the diagnosis  the patient was emergently transferred to the operating room for an open repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm  bearing in mind his stable hemodynamic status. The patient tolerated the surgical procedure well. Post-operative recovery included vigilant monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for two days before being transferred to a regular room. There was no record of post-surgical complications. After a week  he was discharged from the hospital with follow-up appointments scheduled with a vascular surgery specialist and advice to maintain his blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering large pulsatile abdominal masses with referred back pain as a potential sign of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  particularly in males over 65 years old with a history of smoking and hypertension. Early detection and prompt surgical repair can prevent the catastrophic consequence of arterial rupture and associated high mortality rates. This case also highlights the important preventative role of smoking cessation in such patients.  Bottom Line:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a severe condition largely prevalent in males over 65 years of age with a history of smoking  hypertension  and familial history of cardiovascular disease. A sudden-onset  severe abdominal pain should alert clinicians to this diagnosis as early detection and surgical intervention could be life-saving. The role of primary prevention  including targeting modifiable risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis  is crucial in preventing the development of this potentially fatal condition. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,8,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-Year-Old Male - Emphasizing the Diverse Manifestations and Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with complaints of a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The patient was 1.78 meters tall  weighed approximately 96 kg  and was generally physically active.  Clinical Findings: The pain originated in the lower central region of the abdomen and radiated towards the lower back. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the patient's abdomen  along with tachycardia  hypotension  and diaphoresis (profuse sweating).  Medical History: The patient has well-managed hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Additionally  the patient had a history of regular tobacco use  smoking 10-15 cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He had a sedentary lifestyle and a diet rich in fats but has since put more effort into maintaining an active lifestyle and consumed a balanced diet. The patient's older sister also had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted revealing a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.2cm in diameter. An increase in size of the aneurysm was detected in comparison with the CT scan conducted for routine control  a year ago.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room  where open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed. The procedure was carried out without complications  a graft was inserted.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Postoperative follow-up was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day. At the follow-up visit  after 6 weeks  the patient reported being in good health and was readjusting to his routine life. Further surveillance will continue on a 6-month basis to monitor the graft and potential risk of endoleak.  Patient Perspective: Though initially apprehensive  the patient expressed relief upon successful surgery and was determined to amend his lifestyle further to prevent recurrence and enhance overall well-being.  Clinical Lessons: This case stresses the necessity of vigilance in patients presenting with sudden abdominal pain and a familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysms  even when they are displaying changes in their lifestyle and show general health improvements. Regular surveillance in patients with known abdominal aortic aneurysms is also crucial to detect any enlargement in the aneurysm in time. Furthermore  the role of cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms must be addressed in the preventive strategies. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,9,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition  with a higher prevalence in men aged above 60  particularly in Caucasian ethnicities. This case report focuses on the diagnostics  treatment  and management of a 65-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with AAA.  Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired construction worker  presented to the emergency department with a complaint of progressive  severe lower abdominal and back pain of sudden onset. The patient described the severity of the pain as 8 on a scale of 1-10 with the pain spreading to his groin area. He stated his symptoms started unexpectedly while he was at rest at his home. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 35 years and has a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  coronary artery disease for which he had undergone angioplasty seven years back.   On physical examination  he was conscious  oriented  but exhibited signs of distress due to severe pain. His vitals were stable; pulse was 100 beats/min  blood pressure was 170/95 mm Hg  and breathing rate was 20 breaths/min. On inspection and palpation of the abdomen  a pulsatile mass was found in the periumbilical area that was tender on palpation. No bruit was heard on auscultation. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-specific ST-T wave changes but no overt signs of ischemia or infarction.   Clinical Findings  Diagnostics  and Intervention: The initial suspicion of AAA was confirmed through Ultrasound which showed a large mass  approx. 7.5 cm in diameter at the level of the abdominal aorta. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan further confirmed the size and location of the aneurysm  suggesting that it was nearing rupture thus requiring immediate surgical intervention.  After receiving informed consent  the vascular surgical team performed an emergent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The postoperative period was uneventful  with the patient recovering steadily.   Follow-Up and prognosis: Post-surgery  the patient was enrolled in a smoking cessation program and advised to continue his medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient will continue to have annual follow-up CT scans to monitor the graft and the size of the aneurysm. Long term prognosis in such cases largely depends on the patient's ability to quit smoking and manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and treatment of AAA in high-risk individuals. The patient's history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia combined with his age and ethnicity significantly increased his risk of AAA. Prompt diagnostic investigations and timely surgical intervention successfully manage this potentially life-threatening condition  providing the patient with a generally favorable prognosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,10,Title: A Case Report on an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male with Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus  Patient Presentation: Mr. C is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with moderate to severe pain localized in the lower back and abdomen. The pain was previously tolerable but had intensified over the past six hours  prompting his visit to the emergency room. Mr. C described the pain as steady  with occasional sharp pains that seemed to radiate downwards to his left leg. He also complained of lightheadedness but no syncope  chest pain  or dyspnea. Mr. C is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history  having quit 15 years prior to this presentation. He has a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus  managed with lisinopril  hydrochlorothiazide  and metformin.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  Mr. C was awake  alert  and oriented but appeared in discomfort. He was afebrile with a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  a pulse rate of 96 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen  and a bruit was audible over the area. There was no rebound tenderness or rigidity evident. Neurologic exam showed no focal deficits  and extremity examination revealed normal peripheral pulses.  Investigations: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast was ordered  which confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring approximately 6 cm. Lab results showed a slightly elevated white blood cell count  further raising suspicion for a leaking or rupturing AAA. Additional findings included an increased blood glucose level and moderate renal impairment likely secondary to his diagnosed hypertension and diabetes.  Treatment and Outcome: The cardiovascular surgery service was consulted  and Mr. C underwent emergency open repair of the AAA. Intraoperatively  a large infrarenal AAA was identified and successfully repaired with a prosthetic graft. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a slow return of bowel function  but his recovery was eventually successful. Upon one-year follow-up  Mr. C’s graft repair remained intact without signs of endoleak or aneurysm growth.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion for AAA in elderly males  particularly those with risk factors such as age  hypertension  and a history of smoking. Early detection and prompt intervention can significantly reduce the risk of rupture and associated mortality. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,11,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Male: Case Report and Review of the Literature  Patient Demographic: 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: The patient attended the Emergency Department with severe  sudden-onset  abdominal and lower back pain.  History of the presenting complaint: The patient described the pain as “tearing” and radiating to his back  beginning after he had lifted a heavy box at home. He hadn't experienced this type of pain before.  Background Medical History: The patient is a former smoker  quitting twenty years prior after 40-pack years. He has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well-controlled with amlodipine and atorvastatin. The patient also had a previous history of coronary artery disease and had been managed with coronary artery bypass grafting 10 years ago. He is otherwise healthy  with no diagnoses of chronic lung disease  kidney disease  or diabetes.  Physical Examination: The patient was anxious  in pain  but conscious with stable vitals. His blood pressure was 132/88 mm Hg  heart rate 96 bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Abdomen was soft to touch  with the presence of a pulsating midline abdominal mass that was tender on palpation. Auscultation results were normal.   Investigations: Blood tests revealed slightly elevated inflammatory markers. Kidney function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the abdomen revealed a large infra-renal aortic aneurysm measuring 8cm at its largest diameter with signs of rupture.  Management: The patient was immediately transferred to the vascular surgery department for an emergency open repair of the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The surgery was successful  with no major peri-operative issues.  Discussion: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is relatively common in the elderly male population  particularly those with a history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. The typical presentation  as was evident in this case  is a classical triad of severe pain  hypotension  and a pulsatile abdominal mass. An early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention can significantly increase survival rates  making it crucial for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion in high-risk patients presenting with abdominal or back pain.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance and swift action in the face of potential life-threatening conditions such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  particularly in patients belonging to high-risk categories.   
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,12,Title: Large Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-year-old Male  Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are most frequently observed in white males aged 65-75 years old. This report describes a case of an elderly Hispanic male aged 72.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a 72-year-old Hispanic male  born and raised in Texas  USA. He is retired and lives with his wife. The patient has a history of smoking  with a 30 pack-year history. He quit smoking ten years prior.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia. He had been taking Metoprolol and Atorvastatin respectively for these conditions. There is no significant family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysms. He does not have any known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with a 2-week history of vague  intermittent abdominal pain which radiated to the back. He feels a throbbing sensation in his abdomen.  Clinical Findings: On abdominal examination  an expansile and pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Vitals were stable  and all systemic examinations were within normal limits.  Diagnostic Assessment: Abdominal Ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of an Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring about 6 cm in diameter. Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis was then conducted which confirmed the presence of an infra-renal AAA  with a diameter of 5.8 cm.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the size of aneurysm and the patient’s symptoms  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was advised and performed by a vascular surgery team successfully. Patient tolerated the procedure well  and was discharged a few days later on appropriate medications with advice to cease smoking as part of lifestyle modification.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Close follow-ups post-surgery were maintained. On a 2-month follow up visit  CTA showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with no evidence of endoleak. Patient's symptoms had completely resolved. He was a part of smoking cessation program and reports no smoking since discharge.  Discussion: This case illustrates that despite the higher prevalence of AAA in white males  Hispanic males are also affected and doctors need to be aware of this demographic. Further  this case underlines the importance of vigilant detection of AAA in elderly males presenting with unexplained  vague abdominal or back pain. Early detection and treatment can help prevent complications  such as AAA rupture  which carries a high risk of mortality.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,13,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe is a 72-year-old Caucasian male from an urban community in Florida. He is a retired plumber and has lived a sedentary lifestyle for the last 14 years of his retirement. He is a former smoker  having quit smoking well over 20 years ago. His alcohol intake is minimal  approximately one glass of wine per week.   Medical History:   Mr. Doe has had a history of hypertension and high cholesterol for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily. He has been managing these conditions relatively well with the help of medication and annual check-ups. Apart from these  he has been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last ten years  managed with oral Metformin 1000 mg daily and dietary modifications. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died at age 80 due to a myocardial infarction.  Present Illness:  Mr. Doe initially visited his primary care physician complaining of a noticeable pulse in his abdomen along with lower back pain for the past few weeks. As these symptoms persisted with increasing severity  he was referred for an abdominal ultrasound.  Investigations:  The abdominal ultrasound showed a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aorta with a mural thrombus. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) angiography declered the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.6 cm in diameter with partial mural thrombus.  Impression and Plan:  A diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was made  putting the patient at risk for rupture due to the diameter of the aneurysm. After a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits  he was referred to a vascular surgeon for possible repair. The patient agreed to undergo an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Postoperative recovery was uneventful  and the graft was patent on a 1-month postoperative ultrasound.  Follow-up:  Mr. Doe will be followed over time with periodic ultrasound imaging to ensure that the graft remains patent and the aneurysm does not expand. He is also advised to maintain control of his diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol as these are risk factors that could lead to the expansion of the aorta.  This report indicates that a high level of vigilance is required in patients with known risk factors such as hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  diabetes  advanced age  and family history of vascular disease to diagnose AAA and treat it accordingly to prevent catastrophic sequelae like aortic rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,14,Title: An Elderly Male with Asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Case Report  Patient Presentation  Mr. J.C  72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the outpatient department of our hospital for a routine health check-up. He lives independently and his only notable lifestyle behavior includes smoking for the past 50 years (20 cigarettes/day). He denied any symptoms such as back pain  abdominal pain  unintentional weight loss  gastrointestinal problems  or changes in bowel habits.  Past Medical History  The patient’s past medical history revealed no significant abnormalities. He was diagnosed with essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia about 10 years ago  for which he's on prescribed medication: Amlodipine (5mg/day) to manage blood pressure levels and Atorvastatin (20mg/day) to control cholesterol levels. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease – his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 80.  Clinical Examination  On clinical examination  the patient appeared in good health. His vital signs were stable  and physical examination was unremarkable  except for a pulsatile abdominal mass felt on deep palpation of the abdomen. There was no tenderness  guarding  or rigidity noted.  Investigations  Given the patient’s clinical features and the finding of a pulsatile mass  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered. The ultrasound revealed a dilated abdominal aorta measuring 6.2 cm in maximum diameter  indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   A computed tomography angiogram also confirmed the presence of an AAA with intraluminal thrombus and no signs of rupture. Peripheral pulses were present and comparable bilateral lower extremities. Complete blood counts  renal function tests  and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. The fasting lipid profile showed raised LDL cholesterol levels (180 mg/dL).  Management  Given the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture  referral to a vascular surgeon for possible elective repair of the aneurysm was made. The patient underwent elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) without any complications.   To optimize cardiovascular health  lifestyle counseling regarding smoking cessation and cardiac risk factor management was done. The Atorvastatin dose was increased to 40 mg/day  considering his raised LDL cholesterol level.  Follow-Up  At his 3-month follow-up visit  the patient reported no postoperative complications and expressed relief over having undergone the procedure. His LDL cholesterol level had dropped to 100 mg/dL  indicating good adherence to medication.  Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of routine health check-ups in elderly patients  especially those with cardiovascular risk factors  to timely diagnose and manage potentially fatal conditions like AAA.   It also emphasizes the crucial role of lifestyle modifications and control of cardiovascular risk factors in patients diagnosed with AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,15,Patient Information: The case presents a 73-year-old African-American male  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  a 45-pack-year history of smoking  although he quit 10 years ago  and a sedentary lifestyle. He has no known drug allergies  lives alone  is a retired engineer  and is a widower with two adult children. He has never been diagnosed or treated for any cardiovascular disease before.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented at the clinic with complaints of episodic abdominal pain and back pain that he has been experiencing for about two weeks. He described the pain intensity as mild to moderate  without radiation and slightly relieved when he bends forward. He denies any loss of consciousness  history of trauma  fever  night sweats  weight loss  lower limb weakness  or changes in bowel and bladder function. No gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms were reported.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination showed an obese man in no apparent distress  with stable vital signs: blood pressure of 132/84 mmHg  pulse rate 86 beats per minute  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and temperature 98.2°F. He had a pulsating mass in the midline of his abdomen  just above the umbilicus. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. His BMI calculation revealed a value of 31.4 kg/m^2.  Diagnosis: A deeper investigation into the patient’s symptoms was conducted  including lab samples for full blood count  renal function tests  and cardiac markers  all of which returned as normal within reference ranges. An abdominal ultrasound displayed a 5.3 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A subsequent CT angiography confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  with no signs of rupture or dissection. The patient was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the size of the aneurysm (5.5 cm) and the potential risk of rupture  the patient was referred to a vascular surgeon. After discussing the surgical and non-surgical options with the patient and his family  he elected to undergo an elective open aneurysm repair operation.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on the fifth postoperative day in stable condition. He was advised to quit smoking  engage in regular exercise  eat a heart-healthy diet  and maintain continuous control of his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. He was provided with a follow-up appointment with the vascular surgery team in one month to check his recovery and the status of the AAA repair. Long-term follow-up would involve monitoring with regular physical examinations and ultrasonographic check-ups to ensure there's no aneurysm recurrence.  Patient Perspective: The patient recognized he had been ignoring some signs of the disease for a while. However  having undergone successful intervention and been enlightened on the management and potential severe outcomes of his condition  he expressed appreciation for the treatment he received and regretted not seeking medical attention earlier.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was received from the patient for publication of the case details. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,16,Title: Case Report - An Unusual Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Female  Introduction:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) often presents silent until rupturing  making it a leading cause of death among the elderly population. It is most commonly seen in Caucasian males over 65 with a history of smoking  hypertension  and coronary artery disease. This report presents a rare case of AAA in an elderly Caucasian female with diabetes mellitus and a history of smoking.  Case Presentation: Ms. F  a 76-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency room with severe lower abdominal and lumbar pain that had persisted for the past 48 hours. The patient described the pain as sharp  constant  and radiating to her lower back.  Ms. F has a significant history of diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled with Metformin  hypertension treated with Losartan  and a 30-pack year history of smoking that she quit 10 years ago. She has no family history of AAA. The patient claimed compliance with medications and denied any recent trauma  gastrointestinal complaints  chest pain  shortness of breath  or lower limb weakness. On physical examinations  the patient appeared anxious but was hemodynamically stable. Examination of her heart and lungs was unremarkable.  Abdominal examination revealed a palpable mass which was tender and pulsatile in the epigastric region. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.   Laboratory investigations were ordered  and while her hemoglobin was slightly reduced (11.5g/dl)  other standard blood tests  including markers for myocardial infarction (troponin I)  urea  creatinine  electrolytes  and liver function  were within normal limits.  An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan was ordered based on the presenting symptoms and physical examination findings. The CTA scan revealed a 7cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  which was not ruptured but was in imminent risk of rupture.  The patient was promptly admitted in the ICU  given that the size of the AAA was above the threshold for intervention (5.5cm for males  unknown for females). She was medically optimized and then underwent successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Postoperative recovery was uneventful  and the patient was discharged on the 8th postoperative day with timely follow-up appointments.  Conclusions: This case illustrates an unusual presentation of AAA in a female patient who is  based on epidemiological data  not in the typical demographic group. Although AAA is more common in males  clinicians should be vigilant and consider this diagnosis in females with suggestive symptoms and signs  especially with risk factors like smoking and hypertension. It also reinforces the value of physical examination  which prompted an urgent CTA that revealed the aneurysm. This report advocates for consideration of AAA in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and lumbar pain in the elderly population  irrespective of gender.

He is a retired mechanical engineer  a widower  with two adult children. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 40-year smoking history  and he drinks alcohol occasionally.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  currently under medication. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 12 years ago. The patient also had a hernia repair 6 years ago  and maintains a daily low-impact exercise regimen.  Presenting Complaint:  He had been experiencing progressive and intermittent abdominal discomfort and pain in the mid to lower abdomen for several weeks. More recently  his pain was accompanied by occasional lightheadedness and unease. He denied any present symptoms of fever  malaise  appetite changes  or weight loss. No previous episodes of similar symptoms were reported.  Clinical Assessment:  The patient was hemodynamically stable on presentation. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass upon palpation. No signs of peritoneal irritation were observed. Routine blood investigations were normal.  Radiological Findings:  A Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the abdomen was requested which demonstrated an infrarenal aortic aneurysm of 5.6 cm in the greatest transverse diameter. No evidence of rupture or dissection was detected.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical history  physical examination  and radiological findings  the patient was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was admitted for careful monitoring in a vascular surgery unit. Given the advanced age  comorbid conditions  and size of the aneurysm  the multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The patient tolerated the procedure well and made an uneventful recovery. He was discharged on postoperative day three. At the one-month postoperative follow up  he was asymptomatic  and ultrasound demonstrated no endoleak.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of high suspicion and early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm  especially in elderly patients with risk factors and vague abdominal symptoms. Prompt multidisciplinary management can significantly improve the prognosis in these patients.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,18,Title: Management of an Asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Patient  Patient Information:   The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who had arrived at our healthcare facility for a routine post-prostatectomy follow-up. He is a non-smoker  normotensive  and does not have diabetes. His past medical record revealed a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia for which he underwent transurethral prostatectomy six months ago  along with controlled hypertension under medication for the past 10 years. He has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:   At this visit  he had no complaints  but his abdominal examination was suspicious as a pulsatile mass was palpable in the periumbilical area. A subsequent ultrasound and computed tomography scan confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.5 cm in maximum diameter. The patient had mild elevation in serum creatinine level (1.5 mg/dL)  suggesting slightly impaired renal function.  Timeline:   Post prostatectomy follow-up visit: Identification of pulsatile mass. 1 week later: Ultrasound and CT scan performed  confirming an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Diagnostic Assessment:   The diagnosis was established through a combination of physical examination and imaging studies  which included ultrasound and computed tomography scan. Further tests  including full blood count  electrolyte panel  and a coagulation panel  were all within normal limits  except for an elevation in serum creatinine level.  Treatment and Outcome:  Considering the patient's age  comorbid conditions  and size of aneurysm  he was recommended for an elective endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The procedure was carried out without any complications. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. He was discharged 72 hours post-procedure. On subsequent follow-ups at 1 month  3 months  6 months and 1 year  ultrasound showed no signs of aneurysm expansion or endoleak. His renal function also remained stable.  Patient Perspective:  The patient initially had reservations regarding the surgery due to concerns related to his age and recovery. However  after understanding the potential risks of rupture and fatal hemorrhage  he consented to undergo EVAR.  Informed Consent:  An informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to EVAR.  Learning Points:  This case highlights the importance of regular physical examinations  even in asymptomatic patients. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often silent until rupture  therefore early recognition is crucial. This case also underscores the utility of EVAR in elderly patients  showing satisfactory results and a stable postoperative course. Comprehensive post-procedure follow-up is crucial for early detection and management of potential complications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,19,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Male  Patient Information  A 70-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden  severe abdominal pain that radiated to his lower back. The patient described the pain as a sharp  “tearing” sensation. He mentioned no recent trauma to the area. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  a 30 pack-year smoking history  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. His medications include Lisinopril for high blood pressure and a daily aspirin.  Clinical Findings Physical examination revealed a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. He was afebrile. The patient appeared anxious and uncomfortable. His abdomen was slightly distended with a palpable pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal region. Neurological examination was normal. Auscultation revealed no positive findings.  Diagnostic Assessment A computed tomography (CT) angiogram was ordered and revealed a 5.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Lab work including a complete blood count  biochemical profile  and coagulation profile were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram was done due to the risk of cardiovascular disease and did not show any signs of acute myocardial infarction.  Therapeutic Intervention Expecting rupture  the patient was immediately scheduled for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair in consideration of his age and the size of the aneurysm according to the guidelines established by the Society for Vascular Surgery. The surgery was successful and the patient was prescribed antioxidants  statins and beta-blockers postoperatively to manage his blood pressure and risk factors.  Follow-Up and Outcome  The postoperative period was stable and the patient was discharged five days post-treatment with follow-up scheduled in one month. At the one-month follow-up  the patient reported a significant reduction in his abdominal pain. A CT scan showed successful sealing of the aneurysm with no endoleaks.  Patient Perspective The patient acknowledged his longtime smoking habit as a likely factor in developing an aneurysm and showed commitment to quit smoking. He was grateful for the early detection and treatment  which likely saved his life.  Teaching Points  This case illustrates the importance of considering an abdominal aortic aneurysm in elderly patients  particularly males with a history of smoking and hypertension  who present with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of rupture  which carries a high mortality rate.  Authors: [Your Name]  MD Department of General Surgery [Your Institution's Name]
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,20,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient – A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs predominantly in the older population  being more common in males above 65 years. Despite advancements in surgical strategies  the mortality rate in cases of ruptured AAA remains significantly high.  Case Presentation: We present a case of a 76-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed with a ruptured AAA. The patient lives in Beaufort  South Carolina  USA. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year smoking history  but no prior history of cardiovascular disease or any surgical interventions.  The patient presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe  sharp  constant pain in the center of the abdomen radiating to the back. He also reported associated symptoms of lightheadedness  nausea  and diaphoresis. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or bowel or urinary changes. He lives with his wife and was independent in activities of daily living prior to this event.  On physical examination  the patient was anxious and diaphoretic with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass with a diameter of approximately 6 cm in the peri-umbilical area. Lower extremities showed no signs of ischemia.  Laboratory investigations showed hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL  a slightly elevated white blood cell count at 12 x 10^3/µL  and elevated serum creatinine at 1.8 mg/dl indicating kidney impairment. The patient was immediately taken for a CT scan which revealed a 6.5 cm infrarenal AAA with signs of rupture into the retroperitoneal space.  The patient was rushed to the operating room for an emergent open surgical repair of the ruptured AAA. Postoperatively  he was managed in the intensive care unit. Despite a period of hemodynamic instability and renal impairment  the patient showed gradual improvement in overall health and was discharged after 20 days of hospital stay.  Discussion: This case reiterates the severe consequences of an unrecognized AAA. It further highlights the crucial role of early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention  which can dramatically affect the outcome. Therefore  the assessment of AAA should always be considered in older adults presenting with abdominal or back pain  particularly in those with a history of smoking or hypertension.  Conclusion: With the high risk of rupture and mortality associated with AAA  high-risk individuals must be offered surveillance and timely intervention. Dissemination of knowledge about the risk factors and symptoms associated with AAA to primary care providers can increase recognition and improve outcomes for this patient population.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,21,Title: Emergency Repair of Symptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Case Report  Introduction:  This report presents a clinical case of an 80-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  a relatively common condition affecting up to 10% of males over 65 years. Though AAAs are often asymptomatic  they may lead to life-threatening scenarios when ruptured. This case demonstrates the importance of swift detection  diagnosis  and timely surgical intervention to manage this potentially fatal condition.  Case Presentation:  Mr. A  an 80-year-old Caucasian male  with a prior history of hypertension  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset. The patient was a retired industrial worker  lived alone  and followed up regularly for hypertension for the past 20 years. He was a former smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history. He had no known allergies  family history of AAA  or genitourinary problems.   On examination  Mr. A appeared in acute distress with a pallor and a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the umbilical area  with tenderness on deep palpation. Techniques like percussion and auscultation also led to a presumptive diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The patient was quickly stabilized with intravenous fluids  after which a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The AAA measured 8 cm at its largest diameter  providing an explanation for the patient's abdominal pain.   Management and Outcome:  In light of the symptomatic presentation  the patient underwent emergency open surgical repair of the aneurysm. The procedure involved replacing the diseased part of the aorta with a synthetic Dacron graft. Post-surgery  the patient’s recovery was uneventful.   The patient remained stable hemodynamically and was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. He was prescribed blood pressure medications and a statin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. At a 6-month follow-up visit in the clinic  Mr. A was doing well and had no further episodes of severe abdominal pain.    Discussion:  This case signifies the importance of prompt diagnosis and referral for AAAs  especially in older males with risk factors such as hypertension and a history of smoking. Given the large ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients  AAA often remains a silent killer. It further underscores the importance of AAA screening programs and prompt surgical intervention for large or symptomatic AAAs.  Patient Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.    Conflicts of Interest:  The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,22,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Abstract:  This case report illustrates a 70-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented with a clinically significant  asymptomatic  infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Case Presentation:  Mr. A  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  who is a retired teacher  reported to his physician's office for a routine wellness check. He has been living in rural Kansas. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago  after a 40 pack-year history. His alcohol usage is occasional and his family history is notable for a brother who had an AAA repaired at age 75.   On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was evident upon palpation. Due to this  the physician ordered an abdominal ultrasound which revealed an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.6 cm. Despite the large size of the aneurysm  Mr. A reported no abdominal or back pain or any other symptoms indicative of AAA. Additionally  urinalysis  complete blood count  liver function test  serum electrolytes  chest X-ray  and EKG results were all within normal limits.   Due to the size of the AAA and his family history  Mr. A was referred to a vascular surgeon where an elective surgical repair was scheduled. The surgery was uncomplicated and performed through the use of an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  rather than open surgery  due to the patient's advanced age and overall health status. The patient was monitored in hospital for a week and discharged with outpatient follow-up scheduled with his vascular surgeon  as well as continued management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia with his primary care doctor.   Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly found in older Caucasian males with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. Our patient falls into this high-risk demographic. Though the AAA was unexpectedly detected in an asymptomatic patient  the large size of the aneurysm required surgical intervention. Prompt detection and treatment most likely prevented the serious and often fatal complication of rupture. This case emphasizes the importance of routine physical examination and vigilant follow-up in high-risk patients such as Caucasian males aged 65-75 years with a history of smoking.   Conclusion:  Having taken into account the patient's age  comorbidities and the significant size of the aneurysm  an elective EVAR procedure was done successfully. This case underscores the importance of well-directed assessment and intervention in preventing life-threatening complications. It also emphasizes the effectiveness of EVAR in the management of AAA in the elderly.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,23,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Male with Comorbid Hypertension  Introduction:  This report describes a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a 68-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed incidentally during imaging for an unrelated medical issue.   Case Description:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a known case of hypertension and a history of smoking. He reports intermittent episodes of lower back pain  discomfort  and vague abdominal pain. The patient is not a known diabetic  and there has been no reported past history of any cardiovascular disease or stroke. He has been on hypertension therapy for the last 7 years. The patient is a non-drinker and has a 25-year history of smoking  recently quitting 3 years ago on his physician's advice. He has no known allergies.   Upon visiting a gastroenterologist for a routine check-up due to occasional dyspepsia  an upper abdominal ultrasound was performed which incidentally detected an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.3 cm in diameter. The incidental finding led to a referral to a vascular surgeon.  Physical Examination:  Overall  the patient appeared physically healthy  with normal vitals recorded at the time of examination. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed continuous bruit over the periumbilical region. There was no notable abdominal tenderness on palpation.   Diagnostic Assessment:  A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was subsequently done  substantiating the ultrasound findings and revealing an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.3 cm in diameter without any sign of rupture. The relationship between the aneurysm and the renal arteries was well defined  and no iliac artery aneurysms were detected.  Management and Outcome:  Due to the substantial size of the aneurysm  the patient was counseled for elective surgical repair to prevent fatal rupture. After shared decision making  the patient agreed to have an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).   The postoperative period was uneventful  and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits  CT scans showed no endoleak or aneurysm expansion and the patient reported a significant reduction in his symptoms.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the incidental detection of AAA in a patient with known modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and a history of smoking. Endovascular repair provided a good outcome in our patient  highlighting the importance of vigilant screening and management in at-risk populations.   Author's Notes:  This case report underscores the need for AAA screening amongst elderly Caucasian males  particularly in individuals with hypertension and a previous or current smoking habit. Early detection can lead to interventions that may prevent serious sequelae like aneurysm rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,24,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male  Patient Information: The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. His mother had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Chief Complaint: The patient presented in the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden onset severe abdominal pain radiating to his back since a couple of hours ago. The pain was described as sharp  continuous  and worsening.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  an abdominal mass was palpable which was pulsatile in nature. His blood pressure was recorded as 160/90 mmHg and his heart rate as 80 beats per minute. The rest of the cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. His body temperature was 37.1 ˚C and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial laboratory findings showed mild leukocytosis. The electrocardiogram and chest X-ray did not show any significant abnormalities. Given the history and physical examination findings  an urgent abdominal ultrasonography was performed  revealing a 5.6 cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. A subsequent computed tomography angiogram confirmed a large AAA with evidence of imminent rupture but without active extravasation.  Therapeutic Intervention: An emergency laparotomy and open aneurysm repair was performed by the vascular surgery team. The patient received a Dacron tube graft. No complications were encountered during the surgery.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Postoperatively  the patient recovered well  without any complications. He was discharged on postoperative day 6. On follow-up visits at 1 month and again at 6 months  a physical examination and ultrasonography found no evidence of graft complications or new aneurysm development. The patient is being monitored annually and is counseled regularly about the importance of blood pressure and cholesterol management.  Patient Perspective: The patient was initially shocked about his diagnosis but was relieved after successful surgery. He expressed gratitude for the effective management of his condition and committed to follow up and lifestyle modifications.   Discussion: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is a pathologic dilatation of the aorta with a high risk of rupture that increases with the diameter. The risk factors include age above 60  male sex  smoking  hypertension  and family history. This case highlights the importance of a high degree of suspicion in elderly males with sudden onset severe abdominal pain  especially with a history of risk factors  for early diagnosis and effective treatment of this life-threatening condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,25,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in An Asian Female: A Case Report  Demographics: The patient  Ms. J  is a 75-year-old Asian woman from a suburban area. She lives alone  is a retired schoolteacher  and isn’t known to be taking any regular medication. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. Her BMI is 22.5 kg/m2.  Past Medical History: Up until the present complaint  Ms. J reported enjoying good health with no history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  cardiovascular disease  or relevant family history. She has never smoked  drinks moderately  and did not have any surgical history.   Presenting Complaint: Ms. J was brought to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain extending to her back and was faint on arrival. She described the pain as sharp  constant  and the worst she has ever experienced in her life. The pain was not clustered around any particular meal. There were no associated symptoms like vomiting  constipation  urine abnormalities  fever  or weight loss.  Investigation and Diagnosis: A clinical examination demonstrated central abdominal tenderness and a palpable pulsatile mass. Her blood pressure was found to be 90/50 mmHg  heart rate 110bpm and a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL suggestive of hypovolemia. An emergency CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was conducted which revealed a 7 cm infrarenal AAA with signs of rupture and retroperitoneal hematoma. The diagnosis of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) was made.  Management: She was promptly transferred to the operating theatre for an emergency open repair of the rAAA due to her instability. A tube graft repair was performed.  Outcome: Emergent surgery was successful with intraoperative transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells. Post-operative recovery was complicated by acute kidney injury  which required temporary dialysis but gradually resolved. She was discharged after 14-day post-operation once she regained her renal function.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of suspecting and diagnosing rAAA even in patients without typical demographic factors and risk elements of rAAA like smoking  male gender and Caucasian ethnicity. Ms. J  being an Asian woman  falls into a lower-risk category  suggesting the necessity for broadened vigilance to all patient demographics for early detection and management of this often-fatal condition.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,29,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological condition characterized by localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta exceeding the normal diameter by more than 50%. It typically occurs in males over 65 years of age predominantly of Caucasian ethnicity.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and former tobacco usage. He has been being treated for these conditions with antihypertensives and statins for over 20 years. He has a 40-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He doesn't have a family history of AAA.  The patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of severe  sudden-onset pain in the back and the abdominal region  which he described as 'tearing' in nature. He denied any related symptoms such as fever  weight loss  loss of appetite  nausea  vomiting  changes in bowel habits  or hematuria.  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass detectable in the abdominal area  but no signs of peripheral embolization. Blood pressure monitoring indicated hypertension with a reading of 170/90 mmHg.  Investigations: Following the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  an ultrasound was promptly conducted  revealing a 7.2cm infrarenal AAA. Confirmative CT angiography demonstrated a saccular aneurysm of the abdominal aorta  with the largest diameter being 7.9 cm below the renal arteries  without signs of rupture.  Treatment: Given the extent of AAA revealed in diagnostic imaging and symptomatic presentation  the patient was offered an emergent open surgical repair to prevent rupture. During surgery  a tube graft was placed to replace the dilated segment of the aorta.  Post-Operative Course: Post-operative recovery was uneventful. The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for two days then moved to the vascular surgery ward where he engaged in physical therapy. After a hospital stay of 12 days  the patient was discharged in a stable condition. He has regular follow-ups and continuing medical therapy for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Discussion: This case exemplifies the typical demographics and risk profile for AAA - an elderly  Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and significant tobacco use. It highlights the critical role of early recognition of this potentially life-threatening vascular condition and prompt surgical management. The patient's successful recovery underscores the benefits of immediate surgical intervention in symptomatic patients with AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,32,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Caucasian Male  I. Patient Information The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted to the emergency department presenting with sudden intense abdominal pain and a rapid drop in blood pressure. He is a retired professional with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. He lives with his wife and has three adult children. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 27 and is relatively inactive.  II. Clinical Findings On physical examination  the patient was found to be in acute distress with pale skin and cold sweats. He was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg and had tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm. A pulsatile abdominal mass was appreciated on palpation with bruits audible on auscultation over the mass.   III. Timeline The patient experienced sudden onset of knife-like abdominal pain radiating to the back and associated with nausea in the early morning hours. He was brought to the emergency department approximately one hour after the initiation of symptoms.   IV. Diagnostic Assessment The initial suspicion of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was based on the patient's history  clinical presentation  and physical examination. Confirmatory diagnostic testing included a bedside ultrasound showing a large AAA and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealing a ruptured AAA extending into the left iliac artery.   V. Therapeutic Intervention The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). During surgery  the rupture site was identified  isolated  and a stent graft was placed successfully.  VI. Follow-up and Outcomes Post-surgery  the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit where he showed steady improvement with stable hemodynamics. He was transferred to the step-down unit on postoperative day 5 and was discharged home on day 10 with minimal pain and a resolution of symptoms. The patient was advised for smoking cessation  control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia to prevent future aneurysm growth.   VII. Discussion This case serves to highlight the typical presentation of a ruptured AAA  an important clinical entity associated with high mortality rates. Primary care providers should be mindful of risk factors for AAA  including age  male sex  smoking  and hypertension  and consider AAA in their differential for patients presenting with sudden severe abdominal or back pain. Expedient diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival.   Given the patient’s risk factors (age  sex  smoking  and hypertension) he was at high-risk for AAA development. His inactive lifestyle and BMI only served to exacerbate this risk. This case emphasizes the need for appropriate screening and preventive strategies in high-risk groups. Educational strategies aimed at lifestyle modifications can also reduce the incidence and improve mortality rates associated with AAA rupture.

His blood pressure was regulated using antihypertensive medications  and his lipid profile was managed using statins. His post-surgery recovery was event-less and was discharged on day 5 post-procedure. A regimen for the management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia was provided  in addition to advice on maintaining a balanced diet  regular exercise  and moderation of alcohol intake.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:   30-day follow-up showed satisfactory wound healing and no signs of endoleak on the duplex ultrasound. Upon reevaluation at six months  the patient reported no abdominal discomfort and his blood pressure and cholesterol levels had improved significantly due to adhering strictly to prescribed medications and lifestyle changes. The size of his abdominal aorta remained stable at 3.0 cm.  Patient Perspective:   The patient expressed gratitude for his health restoration. He admitted at first to underestimating the importance of managing his hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is now committed to maintaining a healthier lifestyle.  Informed Consent:   The patient has given his consent for this case to be published.  Concluding Remarks:  This case underscores the importance of routine screening for AAA in elderly males with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It highlights the crucial role lifestyle modifications and adhering to medical therapies play in the management of AAA and associated risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,34,Title: A Case Report on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Introduction: We report an interesting case of an elderly male diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Abdominal aortic aneurysms represent a significant issue in vascular surgery  with an estimation of the prevalence in the aging population to be between 4-8%.  Patient Information: The patient  Mr. A  is an 82-year-old Caucasian male hailing from an urban locality. His vital signs upon arrival at the hospital were stable: pulse rate at 75 beats/min  blood pressure 152/88 mm Hg  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  and temperature 97.3°F.  Clinical Findings: Mr. A presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent  dull abdominal pain  and a pulsating sensation in the abdomen for the past two days. He also had accompanying lower back pain and episodes of light-headedness.  Diagnostic Assessment: Upon physical examination  a palpable abdominal mass was felt  which was pulsating in nature  leading to suspicions of an AAA. This was later confirmed via an abdominal ultrasound which revealed an aneurysm measuring approximately 5.3 cm in size. A CT scan further corroborated the diagnosis and estimated the extent of the aneurysm. Complete blood count  liver function test  kidney function test  lipid profile  and blood coagulation profile were within normal limits.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 40-year history of smoking  which he quit five years ago. He has been a hypertensive for the past 20 years and maintains blood pressure levels by adhering to prescribed medication. He was diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) four years ago and is currently on maintenance therapy. His familial history is significant  with his father dying from an untreated AAA rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the size of the aneurysm and potential risk of rupture as well as the acceptable operative risk despite his age and COPD  the patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using a stent graft. His postoperative course was uneventful with strong palpable peripheral pulses. He was discharged after a week. He is currently on regular follow-ups for observation and management of his hypertension and COPD.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic measures in identifying AAAs  especially in elderly patients with long-term smoke exposure  hypertension  and a family history of aneurysms. Prompt surgical intervention may significantly reduce the risk of rupture and subsequent mortality.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,35,Title: Unveiling an Incidental Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Male with Chronic Abdominal Discomfort: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report describes a 70-year-old Hispanic male with an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The epidemiology of the disorder suggests a slightly higher incidence in Caucasian males  making this case a demographic outlier. The goal of this report is to evoke consideration in the differential diagnosis and preventive counseling of older Hispanic males who may be perceived as low-risk due to underrepresentation in research populations.   Case Presentation:  Mr. P. is a 70-year-old Hispanic male who presented with a chronic history of mild lower abdominal discomfort and had recently noticed an increase in symptom severity over the past month. He denied any history of trauma  flank or back pain  or other pertinent symptoms and had a nonsignificant past medical history. His lifestyle factors included smoking (20-pack year history) and moderate alcohol consumption. There was no documented family history of AAA.  After initial examination suggested potential abdominal distention  radiological imaging was ordered revealing a 7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Considering the size of the aneurysm and the associated potential for rupture  Mr. P was immediately referred for a surgical evaluation. He successfully underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and is currently in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program mitigating his risk factors.  Conclusion: The demographic data suggest a slightly higher incidence of AAA in Caucasian elderly males  perhaps leading to unintentional neglect of minority populations in diagnosis and screening. This case underlines the importance of considering AAA in a differential diagnosis regardless of ethnicity  considering shared risk factors  particularly in older  male smokers with chronic abdominal discomfort. Further research should consider ethnically diverse population studies  maximizing the opportunities for early detection  and better prevention efforts.   Learning Points:  1. An abdominal aortic aneurysm can present as chronic mild lower abdominal discomfort  with increases in symptom severity potentially signifying enlargement or impending rupture. 2. Risk factors such as age  gender  smoking  and history of vascular disease contribute to AAA  regardless of ethnic background. 3. Abdominal examination and medical imaging can aid in the diagnosis of AAA  and large aneurysms should prompt immediate surgical referral. 4. It is crucial to exercise an inclusive approach in preventive and diagnostic measures  considering demographic factors  ensuring underserved populations are not overlooked.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,36,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 75-Year-Old Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  A 75-year-old Caucasian male patient presented with persistent lower back pain  mild abdominal discomfort  and a noticeable pulsating mass in his lower abdomen.   Case Description:  The patient in question was a retired tradesman with a history of heavy tobacco use lasting over 30 years. His medical history was remarkable for hypertension  high cholesterol but no diabetes  and no prior abdominal surgeries. This patient had a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his mother suffering a fatal myocardial infarction at age 70 and his father having undergone successful elective surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at a similar age as he is currently.  On physical examination  the patient appeared comfortable; vital signs were stable  with a blood pressure reading of 150/90 mmHg. The heart sounds were normal without any murmur  the lung fields were clear  and the abdomen was soft with a palpable pulsatile mass in the periumbilical region. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  He underwent abdominal ultrasonography  which confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.2 cm in diameter. The diagnosis was later confirmed by a CT angiogram  identifying a fusiform AAA just below the renal arteries without any signs of rupture.   Discussion:  AAA is a relatively common condition that is linked to high mortality rates when ruptured. Risk factors include advanced age  tobacco use  male gender  hypertension  and a family history of the condition. This patient had multiple risk factors  including age  heavy smoking history  a family history of AAA  and a known diagnosis of hypertension. His symptoms  along with these risk factors  made the diagnosis likely.   The fusiform shape  which was found in this case  is the most common type of aneurysm. In general  the larger an aneurysm is  the greater the risk of rupture  with aneurysms over 5 cm in diameter having an annual risk of rupture of about 10%. Therefore  election of surgery for AAA is generally indicated for the aneurysm of a size greater than 5.5 cm  or in patients with symptomatic or rapidly enlarging AAAs. In this case  the patient’s aneurysm  at 5.2 cm  approached the threshold for surgical intervention.  Conclusion:  This case exemplifies the importance of early recognition and timely intervention in the management of AAA  thus improving the outcomes and reducing the risk of rupture with the consequent high mortality rate. In hindsight  screening ultrasonography may have been offered to this patient given his age  smoking history  and family history of AAA.    This case also emphasizes the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA  especially in elderly males with a history of smoking  hypertension  and a family history of AAA. Ultimately  the clinician's mindfulness about this potentially life-threatening condition helped in the early detection and timely intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,37,Title: A Case Report on A Large Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Information: An 80-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  active smoker with a history of consuming 20 cigarettes per day for the past 60 years.   Presenting complaint: The patient reported to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe  sharp  and tearing abdominal pain radiating to the back  along with a feeling of abdominal fullness. He rated the pain as 8 on the scale of 1-10. His pain was disproportionate to his physical findings.  Medical history: The patient has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and he has been irregular with his medications. He denied history of diabetes or any cardiovascular disease but had a family history of atherosclerosis.  Physical Examination: On examination  he was hypertensive with a blood pressure of 165/85mmHg and showed an elevated pulse rate of 105 beats per minute. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid and lower abdomen coupled with moderate tenderness.  Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of a large 6.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with surrounding hematoma indicating rupture.  Treatment: Given his diagnosis and serious condition  an immediate endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was performed. His post-operative period was uneventful. Anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies were aggressively optimized. Smoking cessation was strongly advised.  Follow-up visit: The patient was closely monitored. He was asymptomatic during a 3-month follow-up visit. However  continued surveillance was recommended due to the risk of EVAR failure as well as the need to manage his hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking habit.  Conclusion: This case report concludes that in the elderly population  particularly in those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  a high index of suspicion should be maintained for AAA  especially in those presenting with abdominal pain or abdominal mass. Early diagnosis  immediate surgical intervention  and effective management of risk factors play crucial roles in improving the prognosis of such patients. Any delay could result in life-threatening complications due to rupture. The role of lifestyle modification  particularly smoking cessation  and regular medications cannot be overstated.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,38,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Elderly Male: A Case Report  Patient Description:  The patient is an 80-year-old Caucasian male  residing in an urban area  with a documented history of prolonged smoking. He is retired and lives with his wife. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  with his father having passed away from a myocardial infraction at the age of 67.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a 20-year history of moderate to high blood pressure levels  managed with anti-hypertensive medication. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and prescribed statin therapy 10 years ago. He also has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with metformin.   Presenting Complaint: He presented to the outpatient clinic with unexplained but persistent  dull lower back pain lasting for the past three weeks. No palpable abdominal mass was detected during the physical examination. He had no other symptoms like leg pain  dizziness  syncope  or shortness of breath.  Investigations: The ECG was essentially normal. No abnormalities were identified in his full blood count  liver function test  renal profile  and blood glucose levels. A urine test was also normal. However  given the patient's age  sex  history of hypertension and smoking  an ultrasound was done to rule out an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.6 cm in diameter.   Discussion: The incidence of AAA is significantly higher in males and those over 65 years of age. It is uncommon in individuals below 60 years of age. The patient's prolonged smoking history  male gender  advancing age  diagnosis of hypertension  and hyperlipidemia fall in line with the risk factors identified in the literature. Though the genetic aspect cannot be disregarded  familial AAA was unlikely as the patient had no family history of AAA.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was referred immediately to the vascular surgery department given the size (>5.5cm) and risk of rupture of the aneurysm. He underwent successful elective infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). He has regular post-operative reviews and is doing well so far  with an excellent recovery and no complications. The AAA remains stable in size on the six-month follow-up ultrasound.  This case study underscores the importance of finding and treating AAA in its early stages  particularly in high-risk populations. It is vital to maintain a high index of suspicion based on risk factors and not solely on symptomatology  as the disease could be asymptomatic until rupture. Prompt diagnosis can lead to effective preventive care  thus substantially decreasing morbidity and mortality.  
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,39,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition predominantly seen in the geriatric population  where the aortic wall weakens exhibiting a dilated feature. This report discusses a case of AAA in a 72-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency with severe abdominal pain.  Case Description:  The patient  Mr. X  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and ischemic heart disease. He is a retired engineer who has a 50 pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has been on anti-hypertensives  anti-diabetic medications  and statins. He lives with his wife and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle  being physically inactive for over a decade.  On presentation  the patient complained of sudden onset of severe  tearing abdominal pain radiating to the back. He reported feeling dizzy but denied any loss of consciousness. On physical examination  he appeared pale and sweating profusely. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg coupled with a pulse rate of 110 bpm. His abdomen was distended  tender in the periumbilical region with a palpable pulsatile mass.  Laboratory investigations revealed anemia and increased inflammatory markers. EKG showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Given the clinical index of suspicion for AAA and hemodynamic instability  an urgent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was conducted  which confirmed a 7.4cm infrarenal AAA with evidence of rupture.  The patient was promptly taken to the operating room for emergency open repair of the ruptured AAA. He underwent a successful surgical intervention  with placement of a synthetic graft. His postoperative course was uneventful and was discharged on postoperative day 10  with scheduled follow-ups.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the crucial role of a prompt diagnosis and intervention in a ruptured AAA. Despite its rarity  it emphasizes the importance of considering AAA in older  male patients with multiple risk factors including Caucasian ethnicity  hypertension  smoking  and sedentary lifestyle  who present with a sudden onset of abdominal pain.   Informed consent to publish the details of their case was obtained from the patient.   Patient's Follow-Up: Mr. X is currently being monitored closely in the outpatient department with regular ultrasound screenings for a potential graft-related complication.

The pain was described as sharp  constant  and radiating to his lower back. He mentioned noticing a pulsating sensation in his abdomen recently  although he had not sought medical attention for it. The patient also reported a history of hypertension for which he had been taking antihypertensive medications inconsistently  blaming forgetfulness and lack of discipline. He was former smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack years and had quit 10 years ago. The patient had no known allergies. He led a sedentary lifestyle and drank alcohol moderately. Family history revealed his father had died of a 'ruptured aorta' at the age of 74.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared in moderate distress. Physical examination revealed a pulsating abdominal mass in the periumbilical region  and the patient was tender on deep palpation of the abdomen. His heart rate was 100 beats per minute and blood pressure was mildly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. Peripheral pulses were palpable and symmetric. Rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Findings:  Due to the clinical suspicion raised from the patient's history and physical exam  an urgent abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which resulted in the identification of a 5.6cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  without signs of rupture or dissection.  Treatment  Outcome  and Follow-Up:  The patient was urgently referred to a vascular surgeon. Open surgical repair of the aneurysm was the decided route of management given the size of the aneurysm and the significant risk of rupture. He underwent a successful open infra-renal AAA repair with Dacron graft. He was discharged after one week of hospital stay without any complications. The patient was enrolled in a follow-up program at our vascular surgery clinic  with planned regular abdominal ultrasounds to monitor the status of the repaired aneurysm. The importance of adhering to his antihypertensive therapy was emphasized during the post-discharge meeting with the patient.   Discussion:  The patient's age  ethnicity  gender  history of hypertension  and smoking along with the familial propensity hold classic demographic and risk factor association with the abdominal aortic aneurysm as dictated in medical literature. The case underscores the need for increased awareness of the clinical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms  especially among at-risk populations  to ensure timely detection and management.   Patient Consent:   The patient provided written informed consent for the publication of the case details.

The occupation of the patient was farming until his retirement 13 years ago. The patient lives with his wife with regular visits from their children and grandchildren. He has been a smoker for around 30 years but quit approximately 15 years ago.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension which was diagnosed 20 years ago and has been kept under control with medication. Other medical information includes hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis. He also underwent a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father having died from a heart attack and mother from a stroke.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of intermittent yet persistent abdominal discomfort and back pain for the past few weeks. The pain  according to the patient  does not radiate and is not precipitated by eating  but is exacerbated by exertion. In the last three days  the pain has intensified  becoming constant and the patient added that he felt unusually tired and has been experiencing a loss of appetite.  Examination Findings:  On physical examination  the patient is alert and oriented but seems anxious. His vital signs are BP 160/90 mmHg  Pulse 70/min  respiratory rate 18/min  temperature 37.0 degrees Celsius. Abdominal examination reveals a palpable  pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal region which is tender on deep palpation. No bruits are auscultated. Lower extremities are warm  with 2+ pulses in bilateral distal posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.  Investigations:  An urgent abdominal ultrasound was performed revealing a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. A CT-scan further confirmed the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm without any signs of rupture or dissection.  Diagnosis:  Given the above information  a diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) was made.  Management:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the increasing severity of the patient's symptoms  an open surgical repair (OSR) was decided upon. Post-surgery  the patient was kept under observation in the ICU for 24 hours and then shifted to the ward.  Follow Up:  The patient’s postoperative recovery was uneventful and he was discharged 6 days later. Follow-ups have been planned within 2 weeks  1 month  and then every 6 months to monitor the patient’s condition and any signs of aneurysm recurrence.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the potential silent nature of AAA that can even go unnoticed until becoming symptomatic or rupturing. Hence  more routine screening protocols  particularly in older males with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease  should be implemented for early detection and management.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,44,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Asian Male: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report details the presentation  diagnosis  and management of a rupture in an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a 68-year-old Asian male patient. With a high mortality rate and subtle presentation  ruptured AAA poses a serious diagnostic challenge for physicians.  Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. X is a 68-year-old Asian male with a past medical history notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia controlled with moderate doses of Amlodipine and Atorvastatin respectively. His family history is significant for an AAA in his father. Mr. X has been a smoker for 40 years and admits occasional heavy alcohol intake but no drug use. He was referred from his primary care physician to the hospital due to the sudden onset of severe abdominal and low back pain.  Clinical Findings:  On arrival  the patient was pale and restless with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute  a blood pressure of 88/58 mm Hg  respirations of 22 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with severe tenderness in the mid to lower quadrants and a palpable pulsatile mass. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Due to the patient's history  physical findings  and hypotension  a ruptured AAA was suspected. The patient underwent a CT angiogram  which confirmed a 7.3 cm infrarenal AAA with an adjacent retroperitoneal hematoma indicative of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the diagnosis  the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room. He underwent an emergent open surgical repair of the AAA by means of an aortic bifurcated graft and ligation of the ruptured aneurysm. His postoperative course was managed in the surgical intensive care unit where he required vasopressor support for 48 hours.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  On the fourth postoperative day  vasopressors were discontinued. By the seventh postoperative day  he was transferred to the general floor. He was discharged home with home health services on postoperative day ten. Robust post-discharge follow-up was implemented due to the significant mortality and morbidity associated with ruptured AAA. A follow-up CT scan six months later revealed no evidence of aneurysm or leak.  Conclusions:  This case highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion for ruptured AAA given non-specific symptoms and known risk factors such as male gender  advanced age  family history  and smoking. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality.  Clinical Implications:  Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA in older patients presenting with abdominal or back pain. Timely diagnosis can improve patient outcomes by allowing prompt surgical intervention. Postoperative vigilance in the acute care setting is essential due to possible hemodynamic instability. Regular follow-up with imaging after discharge can ensure graft patency and monitor for complications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,45,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Patient Presenting with Unexplained Abdominal Pain  Introduction: This is a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe lower abdominal pain  who was subsequently diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Case Presentation:  Mr. A is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack year smoking history  who presented to the hospital with a four-hour history of sudden onset sharp  lower abdominal pain which was radiating to his back. He also revealed he has been experiencing episodes of lightheadedness and cold sweats. He denied any history of trauma. He reported no previous diagnosis of any kind of cardiac or vascular disease. His family history was positive for cardiovascular disease  with his father having died from a heart attack in his early 70s.  Upon examination  the patient was pale and sweaty. His pulse was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg  and his respiration rate was 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable pulsatile mass along with tenderness in the lower abdomen.  The patient's CBC showed a hematocrit of 27% (norm: 45-52%). His kidney and liver functions were slightly deranged as reflected by elevated urea and creatinine  and moderately elevated liver enzymes. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia with no other abnormalities.  Differential diagnoses for lower abdominal pain including acute mesenteric ischemia  perforated peptic ulcer  renal colic and ruptured AAA were considered. Given the patient's signs  symptoms and risk factors  the suspicion of a ruptured AAA was high. An urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan was arranged that revealed a large intra-abdominal hematoma along with an 8.5 cm dilated abdominal aorta confirming the diagnosis of ruptured AAA.  Despite the high operative risk given his clinical status  emergency open repair of the ruptured AAA was performed due to the life-threatening nature of the condition. The procedure went successfully without any intraoperative complications. Surveillance of postoperative care was done in intensive care unit with the administration of regular blood products to manage his anemia. His postoperative recovery  while slow due to his advanced age and comorbidities  was uneventful.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering a ruptured AAA in the differential diagnosis of severe abdominal pain  particularly in older patients with risk factors like hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a significant smoking history. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical management greatly improves the prognosis in such cases. This case reiterates the significant role of vigilant history taking  physical examination and appropriate investigations in achieving a lifesaving diagnosis in emergency management. Also  it underscores the need for robust smoking cessation  and hypertension and lipid control programs aimed at this high-risk group. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,46,CASE REPORT  Patient Information:  Mr. A is a 68-year-old Caucasian male living in an urban setting in New York City. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has a history of moderate  consistent tobacco use for 40 years but quit smoking around five years ago. He actively participates in light recreational activities and lives with his wife.  Chief Complaint:  The patient visited the clinic with a complain of persistent abdominal and lower back pain.  Relevant Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been on treatment for the past 10 years. He also has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases with his father having died from myocardial infarction at 72 and his elder brother having undergone surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Examination and Diagnostic Assessment:  A thorough physical examination was performed which was unremarkable except for a tender pulsating mass in the abdomen. A subsequent ultrasound confirmed the presence of AAA with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.0 cm in the maximum diameter. No evidence of rupture was detected. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed afterward for better assessment and planning of potential intervention which further confirmed the diagnosis.  Interventions:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the familial history  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was decided as the course of action after detailing out the procedural benefits and risks. Mr. A gave informed consent for the procedure.  Progress and Outcome:  The endovascular procedure was successful without perioperative complications. The patient was monitored in the hospital for two days and was then discharged. Follow-up sessions and periodical imaging have been advised for routine surveillance. At his first-month follow-up  Mr. A reported significant improvement and cessation of his abdominal and lower back pain.  Learning points:  The case of Mr. A underscores the significance of considering familial history while evaluating pulmonary symptoms in people over the age of 60  particularly those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Early detection and appropriate intervention of AAA can be life-saving  and hence should be highly considered in populations with high-risk factors for the development of AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,47,Title: Emergent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-year old Caucasian Male with a History of Hypertension  Abstract: We present a case of a 72-year old Caucasian male diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  who was successfully managed with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  Case Presentation: The patient  a retired professor  non-smoker  and moderate alcohol drinker  reported to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of intense  tearing lower abdominal and back pain. The patient admitted haematuria since last two days. His past medical history was unremarkable  except for well-controlled hypertension for the past 8 years.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  vital signs were generally stable  but a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. His body mass index was 26.3 kg/m2. Lab tests revealed no signs of infection or anemia but showed a slight elevation in white blood counts and creatinine levels. Electrocardiogram represented no abnormal results.  Diagnosis: Urgent computed tomography (CT) scanning of abdomen and pelvis displayed a 7.2 cm infrarenal AAA with signs of impending rupture  and mild hydronephrosis. Based on clinical and imaging findings  the patient was diagnosed with an emergent AAA.  Intervention: The patient underwent emergent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) within 4 hours of diagnosis. The procedure proceeded without complications  and a post-op CT scan confirmed a successful EVAR with no leak.  Outcome: The patient showed remarkable recovery post-surgery. His postoperative course was uncomplicated  except for transient acute kidney injury likely related to the preoperative hydronephrosis. His symptoms improved considerably  and he was discharged after eight days post-operation.  Conclusion: This case exemplifies the typical demographic pattern of AAA occurring in older  Caucasian males with hypertension history. Prompt diagnosis and swift surgical intervention via EVAR can significantly improve patient outcomes and decrease mortality risk. It reinforces the necessity of maintaining a high index of suspicion in older males with hypertension presenting with unexplained abdominal or back pain and emphasizes the appropriateness of EVAR as an effective treatment solution for AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,49,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Smith  a Caucasian male  aged 72  was brought to the emergency department of our facility. He lives in a suburban region of Pennsylvania and is a retired teacher. Mr Smith has a documented history of 40 pack-years of smoking but quit smoking 10 years ago. There is a familial history of cardiovascular disorders  with both his father and older brother having suffered from myocardial infarction in their late 60s.  Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 10 years and had been on regular antihypertensive treatment (Lisinopril). He is also suffering from hyperlipidemia and is compliant to a statin drug (atorvastatin). In addition  he has well-controlled type II Diabetes Mellitus treated with Metformin. There is no history of any known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented with complaints of intermittent  mild lower abdominal pain that had been troubling him for the past week. The discomfort was described as a pulsating sensation located around the navel area. The pain did not radiate and was not associated with any complaint of chest pain  shortness of breath  or lower limb weakness. There was no associated loss of consciousness  vomiting  chest pain  or dizziness.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient appeared conscious  coherent  and oriented. The patient's vitals were: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg  pulse rate 86/min  respiratory rate 18/min  and temperature 98.6 °F. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass that was palpable in the periumbilical area.  Investigations: Laboratory investigations  including complete blood count  liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The fasting blood glucose level was slightly elevated. An ultrasound of abdomen confirmed the suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  and the diagnosis was later confirmed by a CT scan which showed a 7 cm infrarenal aneurysm with no signs of rupture.  Treatment and Outcome: Given the size and potential risk for rupture of the AAA  the patient underwent an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Postoperatively  he remained stable and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The patient has since been regular to his follow-up visits. As of his most recent visit three months postoperatively  he reported resolution of the initial abdominal symptoms and expressed overall satisfaction with the treatment outcome.   This case depicts the presentation of a potentially lethal condition  an abdominal aortic aneurysm  in a fairly typical patient demographic. Given the risk factors of age  gender  long-term smoking history  hypertension  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  it underscores the importance of clinical vigilance and prompt intervention in managing this condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,50,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are life-threatening conditions that primarily affect older  male population. This report presents a case of a 70-year-old male with a progressively enlarging AAA  detailing the clinical presentation  management  and prognosis of the condition.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension and peripheral arterial disease. He presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of acute onset severe lower back and abdominal pain. The patient has not had any prior surgical interventions.  Upon initial examination  the patient was in apparent distress  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. He was afebrile. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable  pulsatile mass in the mid-epigastric segment  with mild tenderness elicited on deep palpation. No other major clinical signs were detected during the physical examination.  Diagnosis: A Triple-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed a 5.6 cm infrarenal AAA with evidence of impending rupture. Routine laboratory findings were unremarkable except for a mild elevation of white blood cells and a moderate increase in the D-dimer levels  suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory process.   Management: Given the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture  an open surgical repair was immediately planned over endovascular repair due to the patient's anatomical considerations and the surgeon's expertise. The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells preoperatively due to anemia. Intraoperative findings confirmed the CT findings  and a Dacron graft was inserted. The patient had an uneventful recovery after the surgery.   Outcome and Follow-Up: Postoperative recovery was smooth without any complications. The patient was discharged home on the 7th postoperative day with a plan for close follow-up in outpatient clinics. Six months postoperatively  a follow-up CT angiogram showed no evidence of graft leak or aneurysmal enlargement. The patient is also being managed for his hypertension and peripheral arterial disease in a multidisciplinary approach involving a cardiologist  vascular surgeon  and primary care physician.   Discussion: This case delineates the vitality of recognizing AAA symptoms and risk factors promptly  directing towards the appropriate imaging study and ultimately interventional management. Although the mortality rate connected to AAAs remains high  particularly in ruptured cases  improved surveillance and advanced surgical techniques have progressively improved patient outcomes.   Conclusion: An optimized multi-disciplinary approach with timely intervention significantly improves the prognosis for AAA patients and contributes to their quality of life. Clinicians should focus on the importance of early detection especially in high-risk individuals such as elderly males with a history of smoking or hypertension to prevent catastrophic outcomes associated with late presentations.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,51,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta. If undiagnosed  complications can include rupture leading to a true medical emergency with a high mortality rate.  Patient Information: A 78-year-old Caucasian male  non-smoker with a previous history of moderate drinking  was presented at the emergency department with acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain. Past medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  mild hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. The patient was retired and lived alone. He had a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his older brother experiencing fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 82.   Clinical Findings:  Vital signs on arrival demonstrated hypertension (BP=170/90mmHg)  normal heart rate (HR=78 bpm) and slightly elevated respiratory rate (RR=22 per minute). Despite being in apparent distress  the patient was alert and coherent. Physical examination revealed a prominent pulsatile abdominal mass that was tender on deep palpation. No other significant pathological findings were detected during the examination.  Timeline:  On arrival  immediate laboratory investigations were done  which demonstrated mild leukocytosis and a slightly elevated serum creatinine level. Urgent CT-angiography revealed an infrarenal AAA measuring 7.5 cm in maximal diameter with evidence of contained rupture.   Diagnostic Assessment: Based on the CT-angiography findings and patient clinical presentation  a diagnosis of ruptured AAA was made confirming the necessity for urgent surgical intervention. While waiting for surgery  the patient was closely monitored and managed with intravenous fluids and BP control with β-blockers.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent successful open emergency AAA repair with a prosthetic aortic graft. Intraoperatively  a large hematoma was found in the retroperitoneum confirming contained rupture status.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Postoperatively  the patient showed good recovery and was eventually discharged after 10 days. Over a follow-up period of 6 months  he remained asymptomatic without complications.  Conclusion: Diagnosis of AAA can often be challenging due to its silent profile until rupture occurs. When ruptured AAA is suspected  emergent imaging and surgical intervention are vital for favorable outcomes. Furthermore  this case underlines the importance of AAA screening in high-risk populations  such as elderly men with a family history of cardiovascular diseases  to ensure early detection and intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,52,Title: A Case Report of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Male with a History of Hypertension and Smoking  Introduction:  This is the case of Mr. A  a 70-year-old African American male  who presented with an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm during a routine health check-up.  Case Presentation:  The patient is an African American male  aged 70 years  with a past medical history of hypertension and a 45-year smoking history. He had no known allergies  was a non-drinker  and not on any significant medication apart from antihypertensives. He was asymptomatic and denied any recent significant pain  change in bowel habits  or urinary changes. Based on ethnic and age representation in literature  this patient's demographic is reported to be among the highest risk category for incidentally diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms.  He had no personal or family history of vascular diseases or aneurysms. On physical examination  he appeared relatively well  with a body mass index of 29.5 kg/m2  blood pressure of 145/85 mm Hg  and pulse of 72 beats per minute. His cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable except for a faint pulsatile abdominal mass was reported on the patient's routine physical examination.  Further Investigation:  An abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which revealed a saccular aneurysm  measuring around 5.6 cm in diameter located in his infrarenal aorta with no obvious signs of rupture. This prompted a computed tomography of the abdomen which confirmed the aneurysm with similar measures and also ruled out signs of rupture or leak complications.  Management and Follow-up:  Following American Heart Association guidelines  our patient was promptly referred to vascular surgery for consultation and potential intervention. The surgical team opted for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) due to the patient's age and co-morbidities. The procedure was uneventful  and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day five  with close follow-up instructions.  Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) poses a significant health risk especially in elderly males  that too of African-American heritage. In this case  the patient was asymptomatic  which made the case more challenging to diagnose without the routine physical examination. Early diagnosis and intervention are of the utmost importance as AAA is known for its potential to rupture  leading to significant morbidity and mortality. This case reiterates the importance of considering AAA in the differential in men over 65 years with a history of hypertension and smoking.  Conclusion: Raising physician awareness towards asymptomatic patients with common risk factors is crucial to detecting and managing cases of AAA efficiently  hence significantly reducing the risk of rupture and improving patient outcomes.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,53,Title: Emergency Repair of a Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Male  Abstract: This case study examines the management and successful emergency surgical repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a 68-year-old male patient  presenting unique challenges due to the patient's history of co-morbidities.  Introduction: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilated aorta in the abdomen  with a diameter in excess of 3 centimeters  or more than 50% of its normal size. Risk factors include age (typically over 60)  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  a family history of AAA  and Caucasian ethnicity.  Case Report: Mr. Jones  a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history  was brought to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset severe abdominal pain that radiated to his lower back. His pain was described as a sharp  tearing sensation  which was not relieved or exacerbated by movement. He denied any associated symptoms such as chest pain  bowel or bladder disturbances  fever  or lower limb weakness.  On examination  Mr. Jones was pale  clammy  and in obvious distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg  and heart rate 110 bpm  indicating shock. Abdominal examination revealed a tender  pulsatile mass in the middle and lower part of the abdomen.  An urgent abdominal ultrasound showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.5 cm in diameter  suggestive of imminent rupture. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) confirmed these findings.   With a diagnosis of a ruptured AAA  he was immediately transferred to the operating room for an emergency endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The surgery was uneventful  with successful placement of an aortic stent graft. Post-operative recovery was complicated by acute renal failure due to hypotension  but improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Mr. Jones was discharged home on post-op day 7.  Discussion: Mr. Jones' case highlights the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment in patients presenting with a suspected ruptured AAA. His risk factors of age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia aligned with the typically described risk factors for AAA.  Conclusion: Emergent diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing ruptured AAA; a condition carrying a high mortality rate. Assessment of risk factors and prompt  targeted management can facilitate good outcomes. Comprehensive post-operative care is important  especially for complications such as renal failure secondary to prolonged perioperative hypotension. Despite notable risk factors and serious complications  Mr. Jones' case demonstrated successful AAA rupture management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,54,Case Report: An Uncommon Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Female Patient  Abstract: We report an atypical case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presented in a 68-year-old woman  primarily asymptomatic  before identifying the condition during a routine medical check-up. Given the prevalence of AAAs in older men  this case seizes attention due to the patient's gender and unusual symptomatology.   Patient Information: The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired schoolteacher  presented during a routine medical check-up. She had no immediate significant complaints. Her body mass index was within the healthy range and she was nonsmoking. She was not a known case of hypertension  diabetes  or any other cardiovascular disease.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  a slight pulsatile mass was felt in the epigastric area. No pain  discomfort  or other signs of compression symptoms were reported. There was no history of known familial AAA cases.   Diagnostic Assessments: A routine abdominal ultrasound for the unidentified mass led to the suggestion an AAA suspicion. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) angiogram confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a 5.5 cm infrarenal AAA. The aneurysm did not appear to have any signs of rupture or leak.  Therapeutic Interventions: After discussing the risks and benefits with the patient  she elected for surgical repair. Open AAA repair was done successfully without any complications  and the patient was found to be stable post-operatively.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Post-surgical healing was uneventful. The patient was followed up at 1  3  and 6 months with CT scans that showed no aneurysmal change or post-operative complications. She was additionally educated about the importance of regular follow-up consults and monitoring of her cardiovascular health status.  Lessons Learnt: Though AAA is typically symptomatic in most cases  the asymptomatic nature of this patient’s condition  along with her female gender  underpins the importance of routine checks in older individuals to detect the disorder  preventing potential life-threatening complications. It also highlights the crucial role of physicians in physical exam skills and the value of a structured primary care follow-up.  Conclusion: AAAs are more common in older men  but this report underlines that females can also manifest the disease. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility and engage in thorough physical examinations in all patients  irrespective of age and gender  particularly in the primary care setting. Additionally  AAA screening may be beneficial in asymptomatic individuals over the age of 65  especially if they possess other risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,55,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Female Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report pertains to an elderly female patient with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) which is typically a disease of older adults with a median age of occurrence of 76.4 years and predominantly affects males (McCaul et al.  2017). Nevertheless  cases in females do occur  as this report will elucidate.  Patient Presentation:  Mrs. J.  a 78-year-old Caucasian female  presented in the emergency department with severe pain in the lower back and abdominal area  along with nausea  vomiting  and light-headedness. She reported that the pain was sudden in onset  sharp  and radiating to her left leg. The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was a former smoker  having quit 15 years earlier. There was no known family history of aortic disease.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and she had a tender and pulsatile abdomen. An urgent abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 7.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Subsequent computed tomography angiography confirmed a ruptured AAA.  Treatment and Outcome:  Due to the forthcoming risk of imminent rupture  Mrs. J. was immediately taken to the operating theater where she underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as an urgent procedure. Postoperative recovery was uneventful  and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the tenth post-operative day.  Discussion:  AAA rupture is a life-threatening condition with high mortality and morbidity rates. Risk factors for AAA include advanced age  male sex  smoking  Caucasians  and a family history of AAA. This case emphasizes the importance of considering and promptly diagnosing AAA in elderly patients  irrespective of gender  presenting with abdominal or back pain and unstable hemodynamics  as timely intervention with surgery or EVAR can be lifesaving.  Learning Points:  - AAA should be included in the differential diagnosis in any older patient who presents with acute abdominal or back pain. - Risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  former smoking  and Caucasian ethnicity  although less common  can predispose females to AAA. - Timely surgical intervention is paramount in achieving a favorable prognosis in ruptured AAA cases.

Patient Information:  The patient is a retired construction worker living in the Midwest region of the United States and a father of two adult children. He has a known history of hypertension  and his family history is significant for cardiovascular disease (CVD)  with his father succumbing to a myocardial infarction in his early 60s. He has been an active smoker for over 40 years and consumes minimal alcohol. The patient's BMI is slightly high  pegged at 28 kg/m2  which is within the overweight range.   Clinical Findings:  For the past two weeks  the patient complained of a constant dull ache in the middle of his abdomen  which occasionally radiates to his back. The pain intensified when he changed his body position. He reported no changes in his bowel habits  no weight loss  and no symptoms of ischemia.  On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. Auscultation revealed bruit in the peri-umbilical region. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable  with no signs of peripheral arterial disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 7cm infrarenal abdominal aorta aneurysm with no sign of rupture. His lipid profile showed borderline high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. The renal function test results were normal.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was referred for repair of the detected AAA as the diameter was >5.5cm  thus falling under the guideline-recommended threshold for surgical intervention. Given his reasonable physiological status  an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was the chosen form of intervention. Antihypertensives were prescribed to manage his blood pressure  and lifestyle modifications were recommended  including smoking cessation  a heart-healthy diet  and regular exercise.  Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient did well post-operatively  with no complications during hospitalization. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to monitor blood pressure control and aneurysm repair. The patient and his family have initiated changes related to lifestyle modifications.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed relief with the management of his condition and was grateful for early detection of his aneurysm before any severe consequences could occur due to rupture. He acknowledged the need for lifestyle change and was determined to quit smoking.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the significance of timely AAA detection in patients  especially with associated risk factors like older age  male gender  hypertension  smoking  CVD family history  and being overweight. With successful surgical intervention and lifestyle modifications  the prognosis for AAA can be significantly improved.

He has a history of hypertension and was a former smoker  having quit smoking about 18 years ago.   Chief Complaint: The patient complained of mild intermittent leg cramps which he associated with aging and his job's physical demand. He denied recent changes in symptoms  specially any abdominal pain or back pain. He didn't mention any recent weight loss  fever  chills  or any other constitutional symptoms.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a 35-year history of hypertension  which is currently managed with Lisinopril 20mg daily. He quit smoking 18 years ago but has a 30-pack-year smoking history before that. The patient doesn’t have diabetes or hypercholesterolemia  and he had no known personal or family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysm. He also has a laboratory-confirmed history of persistent low-level lipid elevation.  Interim Clinical Examination:  A physical exam revealed a blood pressure of 145/95 mm Hg  a pulse of 78 bpm  and a body mass index of 28 kg/m2. The patient's abdomen was soft and non-tender without any visible pulsatile mass; however  auscultation revealed a subtle bruit over his lower abdomen  which prompted an abdominal ultrasound.  Investigations: The abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a dilated abdominal aorta of 4 cm in diameter  indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The findings were later confirmed by a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis  which better delineated the extent of the aneurysm.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with an asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.   Treatment: Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's age  elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was recommended over open surgical repair. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon and received proper preoperative evaluation and counseling.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of careful physical examination in an asymptomatic patient and underlines the significance of regularly monitoring high-risk individuals like African American men  with a history of hypertension and smoking  in early detection and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,61,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Seventy-year-old Caucasian Male   Patient Overview:  Mr. X is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  living in an urban area. He is a retired engineer  and he lives with his wife. His BMI is within normal limits (24.9)  and he maintains regular physical activity. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and drinks an occasional beer. He has a personal history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  treated with Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily  respectively.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. X presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden  severe abdominal pain radiating to the back. He also reported feeling lightheaded with increased pain on walking  but no syncope. He had no past record of any abdominal pain  and there was no significant reported trauma. He denied any changes in appetite  weight  or bowel habits.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis:  On examination  Mr. X's blood pressure was 150/85mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  temperature 98.6°F  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Upon palpation  an abdominal mass with a pulsativity was noticed. A bruit was also heard on auscultation over the mass. The remainder of the abdominal examination and other system examination findings were unremarkable.  An ultrasound examination of the abdomen demonstrated a large abdominal aortic aneurysm sized approximately 7.5 cm. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen confirmed the ultrasound findings and ruled out rupture of the aneurysm.  Given the size and the ongoing pain  Mr. X was diagnosed with a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Management:  Mr. X was immediately referred to vascular surgery. The surgeons performed an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Postoperatively  he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.  Outcome and Follow-up:  His postoperative period was uneventful  and he was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with prescriptions for antihypertensives and statins. He was advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol intake. He was scheduled for regular follow-up visits. His latest repeat ultrasound  three months post-discharge  shows no abnormalities.  Discussion:  This case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion in diagnosing AAA  especially in elderly males with relevant risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain radiating to the back should raise the suspicion of AAA  even in the absence of hypotension or shock. Early diagnosis and prompt management of AAA is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications such as rupture of the aneurysm. The follow-up is also vital to monitor any recurrence or other complications.  Conclusion:  Close attention to the clinical symptoms  examining the past medical history  and accurate diagnostic tools conduce towards the early and successful management of abdominal aortic aneurysm  which can be life-saving for patients like Mr. X.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,63,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Demographics  Patient's Name: [Redacted for confidentiality]  Gender: Male  Age: 72 years  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Presenting Issue  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain  which had been ongoing for several hours before his arrival. He described the pain as a sharp  tearing sensation in his mid-abdominal area and radiating to his lower back.  Medical History  The patient's medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 45-year history of smoking (two packs a day  although he quit smoking ten years prior). The patient has been treated for both hypertension and hyperlipidemia with regular medications  including a beta-blocker and a statin  respectively.   He underwent a surgical operation five years ago for a right inguinal hernia and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) three years ago. The patient has no known allergies and no familial history of aneurysms.   Examination Findings  On physical examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable due to the pain. He was normotensive  but tachycardic with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. A pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable on examination  and his pain intensified with palpation.  Upon lab investigation  his renal and liver function tests were normal  with slightly elevated white blood cell count indicating possible infection. The electrocardiogram demonstrated no signs of ischemia  and chest radiography showed mild and consistent signs with COPD.  Diagnosis and Management  The clinical examination findings along with the patient's long history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking strongly indicated an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen confirmed an infrarenal AAA measuring 8 cm in diameter with signs of impending rupture.  Given the size and the symptoms of the AAA  emergency surgery was coordinated. The patient underwent successful open surgical repair of the AAA with a Dacron graft.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of considering AAA in the differential diagnosis  particularly in elderly male patients with a long history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presenting with acute abdominal pain radiating to the back. Early recognition and intervention significantly improve outcomes for patients with AAA.  Trends in the demographic data in literature have demonstrated that AAA is more common in males  Caucasians  those over 65  and those with a history of smoking  which are all applicable to this case.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,64,Title: A Case of Asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 74-year-old Male  Introduction:  This is a case report on a 74-year-old Caucasian male presenting with an asymptomatic infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient had no history of AAA or other aortic diseases and was referred to our clinic as part of a routine medical examination after the AAA was discovered.  Case Presentation: The patient  an active man of European descent  is a retired teacher with past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking 20 years ago but his cumulative smoking pack years is calculated at 40 pack-years. He consumes alcohol occasionally  with a frequency of about once per fortnight. He had no family history of AAA or any other connective tissue disorders.  Clinically  he did not exhibit any signs or symptoms suggestive of AAA such as abdominal  back or groin pain  pulsating feeling in the abdomen  or unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed a normotensive  non-diabetic man with no palpable abdominal mass or bruit.   A routine abdominal ultrasound screening showed an infrarenal AAA measuring 4.5cm in maximal diameter. No signs of rupture  leaking  or dissection were noted. The discomfort-free status of the patient with the absence of urgent symptoms prompted a non-emergency approach to management.  Management: The patient was informed about the diagnosis and was educated about the risk factors and potential complications of AAA. Given the size of the aneurysm  in conjunction with current literature recommending repair for AAA sized 5.5 cm or larger  the patient was kept under active surveillance with repetitive ultrasound screening every six months. He was advised to monitor any sudden onset of abdominal pain. Aggressive management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia was stressed  and he was advised to maintain a well-balanced diet  regular physical exercise  and good lifestyle.  Conclusion: This case points highlight the prevalence of AAA among elderly male patients with a history of smoking  even if it was in the distant past. It emphasizes the utility of abdominal ultrasound screening in asymptomatic elderly men for the early detection of AAA  allowing non-emergency management of such patients.  A collaborative approach involving the patient  primary care physician  and vascular surgeon is crucial in managing asymptomatic AAA cases. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle  monitoring signs of AAA progression  and timely follow-up assessments.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,65,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) in Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Patient Profile:  The patient  a 75-year-old African American male  was presented to the emergency department with a complaint of severe  sudden onset of abdominal and back pain. His past medical history included hypertension  hyperlipidemia  tobacco use  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Prior to the presenting symptoms  the patient had no known history of aneurysm in the family.  Clinical Presentation: On physical examination  he was found to be in distress with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. He complained of severe abdominal pain centralized around the umbilical area radiating to the back coupled with dizziness and an episode of fainting. A pulsatile abdominal mass was recognized upon palpation.  Diagnostic Approach: An emergency ultrasound was performed  which indicated a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) was performed next  revealing a 7.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with findings suggestive of imminent rupture  thereby validating the initial AAA suspicion.  Treatment: Emergency surgery was conducted under the consideration of patient's age  overall health status  and the size of the aneurysm. The surgical team decided on an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). A stent graft was placed within the aneurysm to isolate the aneurysm from blood flow and reduce the risk of rupture.  Follow-up: Post-surgery  he was admitted to the ICU where he was closely monitored for indicative signs of postoperative complications. After a two-week follow-up  the patient reported an improvement in overall health symptoms and well-being and was discharged with prescribed blood pressure medication and a follow-up appointment with the vascular surgery team.  Conclusion: This case underlines the need for vigilance in older patients  particularly those with risk factors such as tobacco use  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  as well as the necessity for timely diagnosis and emergency surgical intervention in cases of AAA. Existing literature suggests the prevalence of AAA is higher in older  Caucasian males; however  this case report contributes to the diversity of demographic knowledge of the disease by showcasing an African American male patient.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,66,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: A 73-year-old Caucasian male reported to the emergency department on June 1  2023  with recurrent  acute  and severe abdominal pain accompanied by occasional lower back pain. The patient also reported persistent lethargy and minor weight loss over the past three months. He is a smoker  with a 50-pack-year smoking history  and also has a reported heavy consumption of alcohol over the last twelve years. The patient had no known allergies.   Relevant Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history included hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago and managed with antihypertensives. He was diagnosed and treated for high cholesterol ten years ago. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease two years prior to the current presentation. There was a family history of cardiovascular diseases - the patient's father suffered from a myocardial infarction  and his elder brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) five years back.  Clinical Presentation: Upon examination  he was alert and orientated. The blood pressure on admission was 160/100 mmHg. During the physical examination  a pulsatile midline mass was felt in the abdomen. Lab testing showed anemia and slightly elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea.  Imaging and Diagnosis: Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an infrarenal AAA with a maximum diameter of 5.2 cm. The subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the AAA extending from just below the renal arteries to the beginning of the aortic bifurcation  along with evidence of an impending rupture with a small amount of peri-aortic stranding.  Treatment and Follow-Up: The patient was immediately submitted for emergency open repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm  given the size and signs of potential rupture. The aneurysm was successfully repaired with a polyester  bifurcated aortic graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU for further management.   Postoperative course was uneventful  and he was discharged 10 days after the operation with prescribed medication for his hypertension  high cholesterol along with smoking and alcohol cessation counselling. The patient has been scheduled for a surveillance CT scan after six months and subsequent annual follow-ups.  This case highlights the potential significance of family history in screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms  particularly in patients with peripheral arterial disease and lifestyle risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use. Though the patient arrived due to non-specific symptoms  the physical exam and past medical history directed the clinical suspicion towards the abdominal aortic aneurysm  which was subsequently confirmed by imaging. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,67,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a History of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia: A Case Report  Introduction:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta exceeding its normal diameter by more than 50 percent. The AAA poses a significant risk to the patient's life if ruptured due to severe sudden internal bleeding  warranting early diagnosis and appropriate management.   Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. S is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired engineer. He was residing in the urban areas of the Midwest region of the United States with a regular follow-up for chronic health problems. He is a former smoker with a 15-pack-year smoking history  a moderate alcohol consumer  not known to have any drug addiction  and has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings: Mr. S presented to the emergency room with symptoms of moderate  dull-constant abdominal and back pain exacerbated over the past two days. During the examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated.  Past Medical History: He has high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia controlled with amlodipine 10 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily  respectively. There is no family history of any aneurysm.  Diagnostic Assessment: A high-index suspicion of AAA prompted an urgent abdominal ultrasound which revealed an infrarenal abdominal aorta with a maximal transverse diameter of 6.5 cm  suggesting an AAA. This was later confirmed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen  reported as an infrarenal AAA with no sign of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's presenting symptoms  urgent surgical repair was advised to prevent rupture risk. The patient underwent open surgical repair (OSR) of the AAA. Intraoperatively  the AAA was confirmed and replaced with a Dacron graft.  Follow-Up and Outcome: Postoperatively  the patient recovered well without any complications. On six months follow-up  a surveillance ultrasound demonstrated that the graft was patent and there was no sign of an aneurysm.  Conclusions:   This case underscores the importance of considering AAA in the differential diagnosis in elderly male patients presenting with abdominal and/or back pain  especially those with risk factors including a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Early recognition and timely intervention can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality related to AAA.   Patient Perspective:  Mr. S appreciated the care provided by the team and the successful surgery outcome. He was relieved and motivated to adhere to regular follow-ups and a healthier lifestyle  including a low-fat diet  moderating alcohol consumption  and completely avoiding tobacco.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,68,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a significant health concern  especially in elderly Caucasian males where the prevalence is significantly higher. This case report describes an interesting scenario of a late-presenting AAA in this high-risk demographic.  Patient Information: Mr. X  a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 26.8  presented at our hospital. He lives in a nursing home and is a former smoker (30 pack-years) who quit approximately 15 years ago. He was moderately active prior to presentation. His family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases (his father had a myocardial infarction in his late 50s). His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and a history of mild hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Findings: The patient was initially seen for complaints of episodic abdominal discomfort and early satiety over the past few months  not associated with any specific type of food or activity. Over the past few days prior to presentation  he experienced an exacerbation in the severity of the pain  along with the sensation of a throbbing mass in his abdomen. There were no secondary signs or symptoms indicative of rupture such as back pain or hemodynamic instability.  Diagnostic Assessment: A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. However  due to the clinical suspicion of AAA  an urgent ultrasound was ordered. The ultrasound images demonstrated a fusiform aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta measuring 5.2 cm in maximal diameter. A subsequent CT angiography confirmed the presence of an AAA with a maximal diameter of 5.5 cm extending from the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation without evidence of rupture or leak.  Intervention and Outcome: Following a discussion of risks  benefits  and options  the patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The intra-operative period was uneventful  and the AAA was successfully excluded. Postoperatively  he had an uncomplicated course and was discharged home on postoperative day 6. On follow-up in the vascular surgery clinic one month after discharge  he was doing well with resolution of his abdominal pain.  Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance of considering AAA within the differential diagnosis in elderly men presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms  especially in the presence of risk factors like advanced age  smoking history  and underlying hypertension. Timely interventions like EVAR can potentially prevent catastrophic events such as rupture and subsequently improve the patient outcomes.

He is married  has two children  and is a retiree from a construction company. He has limited physical internet access and healthcare facilities. His primary language is English  and he has an income below the national average.  II. Medical History:  The patient has been managing hypertension for 15 years and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago. He is also a former smoker with a quitting history spanning 10 years. He has hyperlipidemia and a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 66. Despite these conditions  the patient has been making steady improvements in managing his conditions through changes to his diet  increased physical activity  and medication adherence.  III. Presenting Complaint and Examination:  The patient presented with episodes of abdominal back pain over the past three weeks. He reports that pain usually lasts several minutes and subsides without any intervention. On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected slightly towards the left of the midline. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.  IV. Investigations:  Considering the age  medical history  and physical exam findings of the patient  an abdominal ultrasound was conducted. This revealed an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 5.5cm. His blood pressure was elevated at 155/95 mmHg  and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.2%  indicating a modestly controlled diabetes condition. His lipid profile showed raised Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) at 145 mg/dL.  V. Management:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient’s symptomatic status  the decision was made to perform elective surgery to prevent rupture. The procedure carried out was an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) due to his age and comorbidities. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also further managed via adequate control of blood pressure and statin therapy  respectively.  VI. Outcome:  The surgery was successful  and the patient remained stable throughout the post-operative period. He was advised to continue his blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medications and achieve better control of his diabetes. Lifelong surveillance of his aneurysm via regular ultrasound monitoring every 6 months was also planned. The patient was advised about the symptomatic warning signs (sudden abdominal or back pain) that should prompt immediate medical attention.  This case emphasizes the crucial challenge of managing an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with multiple comorbid conditions  in a remote geographical location  with socioeconomic restrictions. It also underscores the essential role of personalized care and remote monitoring in managing such complicated scenarios.

He is married with three adult children and is a retired engineer. The patient has an active lifestyle and does not smoke or consume alcohol. He does not have a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  2. Clinical Findings:  The patient visited the hospital for a routine health check-up. He had no presenting symptoms or complaints related to cardiovascular or respiratory function. However  he reported occasional episodes of mild abdominal discomfort.  3. Timeline:  The mild stomach discomfort has been ongoing for the past six months. He generally noticed it post meals and didn't associate with any specific food or activity. The patient didn't lay emphasis on these symptoms due to their mild nature and infrequent occurrence.  4. Diagnostic Assessment:  The physical examination of the lungs and heart was normal; the abdomen was soft with a palpable pulsatile mass in the center. Initial suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suggested. Therefore  an abdominal ultrasound was performed  revealing a 6.5cm diameter AAA. No other abnormalities or health concerns were detected during the body examination.  An electrocardiogram (ECG) was also performed  which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm  and routine blood tests were all within normal limits. The patient was then referred for a CT angiography to better visualize the extent of the aneurysm.  5. Therapeutic Interventions:  Considering the aneurysm size and the patient's overall health  an elective open aneurysm repair surgery  a standard procedure for AAA of diameter larger than 5.5cm  was recommended by the vascular surgeon. The patient concurred with the recommendation after discussing the complication risks associated with the condition and its surgical repair.  6. Follow-up and Outcomes:  The AAA repair was performed successfully without any complications. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. He has been under observation with regular follow-ups at three  six  and twelve months intervals. So far  there have been no signs of AAA recurrence or surgical complications. The patient continues to report improvement and is satisfied with the course of treatment.  7. Patient Perspectives:  The patient expressed satisfaction regarding his overall treatment and gratefulness for the detection of an otherwise asymptomatic AAA through routine health checkups.  8. Teaching Points:  This case highlights the importance of routine health check-up  especially for the elderly  and how asymptomatic illnesses can be detected timely and managed effectively. An asymptomatic AAA  if undetected  could have led to a significant health event in the patient.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,72,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-Year Old Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common condition among older adults  especially males over the age of 65. It is characterized by localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta. Though common  AAA is a fatal condition if ruptured due to high mortality rates. Here  we present a case of a 72-year-old male who was diagnosed with an AAA.   Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male from the suburbs  retired  and living with his wife. His body weight is 68 kg and a height of 173 cm. He is a former smoker and has quit smoking for about 15 years.   Health History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are controlled with medications. No significant family history was elicited related to cardiovascular diseases. He was physically active and his diet was relatively healthy although he occasionally enjoyed a high cholesterol diet.  Presenting Complaints: The patient visited his primary care physician for a routine check-up. He complained of a subtle  nagging abdominal pain and mild lower back pain for the past two weeks. He described the pain as dull and constant but tolerable. No other symptoms like rapid heart rate  shortness of breath  or noticeable weight loss were reported.  Diagnosis and Treatment: Based on the patient’s age  history  and symptoms  an abdominal ultrasound scan was recommended  and the results revealed a 6cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was also performed to confirm the diagnosis and revealed a fusiform infrarenal AAA measuring 6.2 cm with relatively intact and healthy-looking arterial walls.   Given the measure of the aneurysm and the symptomatic presentation  our vascular surgery team decided to operate. The patient underwent successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).   Follow-Up and Outcome: The patient was monitored post-operation in the hospital for 48 hours  during which his recovery went well without complications. On a 3-month follow-up visit  a reassessment abdominal ultrasound indicated no expansion of the aneurysm  no endoleaks and the patient was symptom-free. The patient was advised to continue managing his hypertension and hyperlipidemia  quit a high cholesterol diet fully and to continue staying physically active.  Informed Consent: Written and informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of recognizing potential symptoms of AAA  especially in older male patients. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are crucial to prevent the fatal consequences of a ruptured aneurysm. Furthermore  it underscores the relation of AAA with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  emphasizing the need for proper management of these conditions in older adults.       
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,73,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male: A Case Report   Introduction: This report highlights the case of a 76-year-old Caucasian male with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Patient Information: Mr. A  a 76-year-old Caucasian man  a retired steelworker from Ohio presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset pain in his lower back and abdomen along with generalized weakness.  Clinical Findings: Mr. A appeared pale and sweaty  with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg  and a pulse rate of 110 bpm. On physical examination  he had a tender pulsatile mass in his abdomen with referred pain radiating to his back.   Medical History: His past medical history revealed that he was a smoker for about 50 years  had hypertension controlled with medication  and had a known diagnosis of AAA for last 5 years which was being monitored regularly. He also had a family history of AAA. However  due to low patient compliance  the regular check-ups pertaining to his AAA were sporadic.   Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent abdominal ultrasound and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the rupture of an 8 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with a surrounding hematoma.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was introduced to emergency open repair surgery. The aneurysm was replaced with a synthetic graft  and the hematoma was evacuated.  Follow-Up and Outcome: Mr. A’s postoperative recovery was complicated by pneumonia and acute renal failure. However  with a multiple disciplinary team approach involving cardiologists  nephrologists  pulmonologists  and physical therapists  he was able to make a slow recovery over the course of three months in the hospital. At his six months follow-up  the graft was intact and he was back to his usual health.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring of known abdominal aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients  especially those over the age of 65  with a history of smoking and cardiovascular diseases. Punctual health surveillance can prevent catastrophic events like rupture  which significantly increases mortality rates  despite successful surgical interventions.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,74,Title: An Incidentally Discovered Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an 80-year-old African-American Male  Introduction: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular ailment affecting around 3-10% of older adults globally. However  there's noticeably limited literature documenting cases among the African-American population which makes this unique case particularly worth discussing. This report presents an intriguing case of an asymptomatic 80-year-old African-American male with an incidentally discovered abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Case Presentation: The patient is an 80-year-old African-American male  non-smoker  with a past medical history that includes well-controlled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He is a retired teacher  living independently  with a history of former social drinking and no drug abuse. He reported to the outpatient department for a routine check-up as part of his follow-up care for hypertension and diabetes. He exhibited no complaints of abdominal pain  back pain or recent weight loss.   On physical examination  the patient appeared comfortable with a BMI of 28. Vital signs were all within normal limits. No abdominal pulsatile masses were palpated during the routine abdominal examinations. The cardiovascular review was also unremarkable.  Due to his history of hypertension  and as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment  the physician ordered an abdominal ultrasonography. The ultrasound incidentally revealed an infra-renal AAA  measuring 5.5 cm in largest diameter. The patient was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.  The patient underwent a successful elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). After a hospital stay of 5 days  he was discharged to home with appropriate pain control  with instructions to return in 6 weeks for a follow-up CT angiogram to assess the durability of the repair.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the essential role of routine physical examination and a comprehensive geriatric assessment for the early detection of vascular conditions such as AAA in elderly patients  even in the absence of risk factors such as smoking or Caucasian race. The unexpected diagnosis in this asymptomatic 80-year-old African-American male underscores the necessity for an index of suspicion for AAA in the elderly population regardless of race and typical risk factors. Moreover  it emphasizes the effectiveness of EVAR as a less invasive modality in the successful treatment of AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,75,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Male Patient  Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms of intense abdominal pain  back pain and general malaise. The patient has a known past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and 30 years of smoking  with an estimated cumulative exposure of 45 pack-years. He had successfully quit the habit approximately five years earlier. He also reported a familial history of aneurysms  with his father having died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 72. The patient lives independently and admits to a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activities.  Clinical Findings: The patient looks pale and is in considerable distress  reporting constant  severe  and pulsatile abdominal and back pain. Initial vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 110/64 mmHg  pulse 112 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass is palpable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given his symptoms and family history  an immediate abdominal ultrasound was conducted in the ED  and it revealed an AAA with a maximum diameter of 8.5 cm  with signs of rupture. Full blood count showed normocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin levels at 9.7 g/dL. Renal function tests and liver function tests were within normal range.  Therapeutic Intervention: After immediate consultation with the vascular surgery team  an emergency repair was performed through Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). The procedure was successful  and no immediate postoperative complications were observed.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient's hemodynamic status remained stable post-surgery  and he was transferred out of intensive care on day 3 post-op. He was discharged on the 8th postoperative day. Received routine follow-ups at outpatient clinic showed no signs of endoleak or AAA recurrence. The patient was also counseled on the importance of lifestyle alterations including diet modification and incorporation of regular physical activities to keep his hypertension and hyperlipidemia under control.  Patient's Perspective: The patient expressed relief at having survived a life-threatening condition his father succumbed to. He was grateful for the speedy diagnosis and effective treatment. He mentioned his intention to follow medical advice on lifestyle modifications and attend regular check-ups with diligence.  Final Note: This case demonstrates the need for heightened vigilance in patients with significant risk factors such as advanced age  hypertension  smoking history and family history of AAAs. Quick diagnosis and appropriate management in such rapidly progressing  life-threatening situations can substantially improve patient outcomes.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,76,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Caucasian Male  Introduction: The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  an enlargement or bulge that develops in the wall of the aorta  remains one of the most potentially life-threatening vascular diseases due to the risk of rupture. In most cases  it is asymptomatic until rupture leading to high mortality rates. Studies consistently show that males  particularly those of the Caucasian race  older than 65 and those with a history of smoking  are at most risk.  Case Description:  A 71-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of intense pain in his lower back and abdomen  along with dizziness and increasing fatigue. He reported a history of hypertension  moderate renal impairment  and had been a smoker for about 35 years but had quit 10 years earlier.  His vital signs showed blood pressure slightly high at 140/92 mmHg in the right arm and 138/91 mmHg in the left arm. His heart rate was 83 beats per minute and respiratory rate was 19 breaths per minute. BMI was recorded as 26 kg/m2. Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the abdomen.  The patient was sent immediately for computed tomography angiography which revealed a 7.3 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with evidence of a contained rupture. No other aneurysms were present. His laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL  a white blood cell count of 12.9 x109/L  platelet count of 178 x109/L  serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL  and increased levels of D-dimer (1.3 μg/mL).  He was urgently referred to a vascular surgeon who performed an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  considering the patient's symptomatic status and the size of the aneurysm. The postoperative period was uneventful  with recovery and close monitoring of his renal function.  Discussion:  Prompt recognition of AAA symptoms and appropriate investigations probably saved this patient's life. His risk factors (age  gender  race  smoking history  hypertension) should have raised clinical suspicion of an AAA earlier  during routine examinations. AAA screening  aimed primarily at males aged 65-75 years who have ever smoked  may have enabled pre-emptive elective repair  avoiding the significant morbidity and mortality associated with rupture.  Conclusion:  This case report shows the importance of risk factor recognition for AAA and the value of early detection and treatment. Increased awareness and adherence to screening guidelines could contribute to lower AAA mortality rates in the at-risk population. Regular follow-up of patients with moderate renal impairment  especially in those with risk factors for developing AAA  is prudent. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,77,Title: Sudden Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male: A Case Report  Patient Information: An 81-year-old Caucasian male  retired wooden furniture artist  presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden severe abdominal pain accompanied by back pain. The patient is a resident of a small agricultural town in Iowa  living with his wife.  Clinical Findings: The patient described his pain as sharp and concentrated mainly in the mid-abdominal area with a consistency that radiates to the lower back. The pain intensity was gradually increasing throughout the day. On arrival  his vital signs were stable with a slightly elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass.  Patient’s Past Medical and Surgical History: The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension managed with amlodipine for the past 10 years. He also has early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to a history of long-term smoking but quit about 15 years ago. He has no history of surgeries. The patient denied any family history of cardiovascular diseases; however  he mentioned diabetes on his mother’s side.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the symptoms and physical findings  suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was raised. An urgent abdominal ultrasound was ordered and revealed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.5 cm in diameter. Further confirmation was obtained by a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scan.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the larger size of the AAA and risk of rupture  the patient was immediately scheduled for an emergency open AAA surgical repair. The surgery was successful without post-operative complications.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient’s post-operative hospital stay was uneventful. His pain was managed effectively  and vital signs remained stable. A CT scan on post-operative day 3 showed successful repair of the AAA with no signs of leakage or dissection. He was discharged home on post-operative day 5 with optimal recovery. Regular outpatient follow up was arranged for blood pressure control and monitoring of the surgical site via ultrasound imaging.  Patient Perspective: The sudden severe pain worried the patient  yet the immediate care he received and the successful resolution of his situation left him relieved and grateful. He became more aware of AAA and resolved to comply with the prescribed medication regimen and follow-up plans.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.  Conclusions: This case highlights the crucial need for early detection and intervention in patients presenting with characteristic symptoms of AAA. Elderly males with a history of hypertension and smoking  even those living in rural settings  may have a higher risk of AAA and should be counseled and screened appropriately.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,78,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction: We present a case of a 66-year-old  Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heavy smoking  who was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Demographics: The patient is originally from the mid-western region in the United States  with no significant family history of disease apart from his father who had myocardial infarction at the age of 70. He is a retired mechanical engineer  married with two grown-up daughters. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit six years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any use of illicit drugs.  Medical History: The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago and hyperlipidemia 15 years ago. His other relevant history included obesity; BMI: 31. Both conditions were managed with medication  namely Amlodipine 10mg for hypertension and Atorvastatin 20mg for hyperlipidemia. There is no history of diabetes  stroke  or other cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaint: The patient attended a routine health check-up in the local health center in March. An abdominal ultrasonography for prostate screening accidentally showed a 4.5 cm infrarenal AAA. The patient was asymptomatic  and there were no notable changes in his weight  appetite  or bowel movements.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared well preserved for his age. His vital signs were within normal range  but blood pressure was slightly higher (150/90 mmHg). Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds  no murmurs. The abdomen was soft  non-tender  and a pulsatile mass was palpable centrally. No peripheral arterial disease signs were noted.  Investigation: A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the presence of a 4.5 cm AAA without any sign of rupture or dissection. Lipid panel showed elevated LDL cholesterol of 180 mg/dl. Other laboratory tests including blood count  kidney function  and coagulation were normal.  Management: The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon who recommended conservative management with surveillance because the aneurysm was smaller than 5 cm. He was advised to have an ultrasound examination every 6 months to monitor any aneurysm growth. Also  the patient was encouraged to optimize his hypertension control  continue his statin therapy  adopt a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  and maintain a healthy weight.  Conclusion: This case exemplifies the importance of routine health screenings  in which an asymptomatic AAA was detected in this high-risk patient due to his age  sex  race  smoking history  and presence of vascular comorbid conditions. The patient is following the recommended surveillance strategy and lifestyle modifications which he embraced fully since the discovery of the aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,79,Case Report  Patient Information  We present a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a chief complaint of persistent and sudden-onset abdominal pain of 6 hours duration. The pain was described as severe and radiating to the lower back. The patient also reported a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. No history of trauma or injury was reported. The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco use but quit smoking 10 years ago. A family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was noted  with a brother who died due to ruptured AAA.  Clinical Findings  The physical examination showed a distended abdomen with a palpable pulsatile mass noted in the periumbilical area. There was no sign of peritoneal irritation  and bowel sounds were normoactive. The remainder of the cardiovascular examination was unremarkable  with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops detected. His blood pressure was recorded as 158/95 mmHg and he had a regular pulse with a rate of 72 beats per minute. His respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute  and his pulse oximetry reading was 96% on room air. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.  Diagnostic Assessment  Due to the clinical suspicion of an AAA  an emergency abdominal ultrasound was performed  which revealed a 6.8 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Computed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed the presence of an infrarenal AAA with no sign of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention  Instant consultation with vascular surgery was made. Due to the large size of the AAA along with the presence of symptoms  urgent open surgical repair was planned. Informed consent was obtained from the patient. The procedure was successful and the patient tolerated the procedure well.   Follow-up and Outcome  The patient’s post-operative course was uneventful. He was managed in the Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours post-operatively for close monitoring. He was then transferred to the general ward once he was hemodynamically stable. The patient was discharged 6 days post-operation with advice for regular follow-up. At his 1-month follow-up consultation  he reported significant improvement  with no pain or discomfort.   Informed Consent  The patient included in this study gave written informed consent.   Notes   This case report highlights the need for high index of suspicion for AAA in patients presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms  especially older male patients  those with a positive family history of AAA  those with known risk factors like smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Early diagnosis and timely intervention prove vital in preventing fatal outcomes from a ruptured AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,80,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Case Study  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe low back and abdominal pain. He has a history of heavy smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He reported significant weight loss over the past couple of months accompanying with poor appetite and fatigue. The patient admits to a previous diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  but does not remember the dimensions or any details about it. The patient is retired and lives alone  limiting his accessibility to support and health care.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient is pale  slightly diaphoretic and agitated. His pulse is rapid and thready  his blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. The abdominal examination revealed a significant pulsatile mass. His hemoglobin level was noted to be low (8.5 g/dL) and white cell count was elevated (14 000/mm3)  indicating possible hemorrhage and infection.  Diagnostic Assessment: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large infrarenal AAA measuring 8 cm in maximum diameter with a contained rupture into retroperitoneum. No other significant findings were observed.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The situation was explained to the patient  his family was contacted  and informed consent for emergency surgery was obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent open aortic aneurysm repair with a Dacron graft. Approximately 2000 ml of blood was lost during the operation  this blood loss was replaced with intravenous fluid and blood transfusion.   Follow-Up and Outcomes: Post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia and transient renal insufficiency. However  with appropriate treatment  the patient was stable and transferred to the ward on postoperative day 5. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 14 with normal renal function and stable vital signs. At the 3-month follow-up visit  the patient was recovering well  although complaining of decreased energy levels.  Patient Perspective: While afraid initially  the patient was grateful for the care provided and understood the severity of his condition. He expressed determination to improve his lifestyle habits (reducing smoking  healthy eating) to prevent such medical emergencies in the future.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of regular medical check-ups in individuals at risk for AAA  especially those with a prior diagnosis. Awareness and knowledge about AAA  its symptoms  and recommended follow-ups are vital to prevent life-threatening situations.  Learning Points: AAA is frequently asymptomatic until it ruptures  leading to a high mortality rate. Regular monitoring and early intervention in at-risk patients  such as elderly males with a history of smoking and hypertension  is crucial to lower fatality rates. This case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive patient education and establishing strong health worker-patient communication.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,81,Title: Case Report on a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction:  This case study details a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presented with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  a condition in which there is enlargement of the lower part of the aorta. Notably  he had no known history of AAA and this report discusses the course of his diagnosis  treatment  and management.  Case Report:  The patient  a retired construction worker from Boston  Massachusetts  presented himself in the emergency department complaining about a 3-day history of growing pain in his abdomen and back. This was associated with feelings of fullness and episodes of nausea. He denied experiencing any fever  chills  shortness of breath  or change in bowel movements. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and long-standing history of smoking 1-2 packs a day for 50 years  but no known malignancies. His family history revealed his father died due to AAA rupture at the age of 60  and his mother died due to heart failure.  On physical examination  the patient was in mild distress due to pain. A palpable  pulsatile abdominal mass was found upon palpation. His pulse rate was 90 beats/minute  and blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. CBC  biochemical profile  stool guaiac test were all within normal limits  but the patient’s urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria.  Given the clinical findings and the family history  an abdominal ultrasonography was ordered showing a 7 cm infrarenal AAA. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the infrarenal AAA  slightly tortuous  with no signs of rupture but with high risk given the diameter. These findings raised the suspicion for a symptomatic  non-ruptured AAA.  Considering the patient's AAA size  the patient was consulted for emergency surgical repair to minimize the risk of AAA rupture. In light of this  an open surgical repair (OSR) was performed by a vascular surgeon in which a graft was placed  and the aneurysmal part of the aorta was replaced.   Discussion:  The patient’s history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  as well as his age and genetics  form a typical demographic for AAAs. AAA is commonly seen in individuals over the age of 65 with Caucasian males having the highest prevalence. Furthermore  his family history and the presence of microscopic hematuria increased his risk.  Conclusion:  Post-operative recovery was uneventful with improvement of his symptoms. The patient was discharged home after 6 days of hospitalization with a follow-up appointment in vascular surgery and advice to cease smoking. This case emphasizes the need for early detection and awareness of AAA  given the increased risk in certain populations. A more systematic AAA screening protocol in male smokers  especially with a positive family history  might be beneficial to prevent life-threatening AAA rupture. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,82,Patient Description:  A 73-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency department with a chief complaint of acute onset abdominal and lower back pain  together with nausea.   Past Medical History:  The patient had a history of smoking for about 40 years (2 packs of cigarettes per day)  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He also reported a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with his father having died suddenly of a presumed (due to presenting symptoms) ruptured AAA at the age of 68.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a retiree  living by himself in his household  and is dependent on a state pension to get by. He is of medium build with being 1.75m tall and weighing 78 kg. He is widowed and has two kids who live out of state. In terms of alcohol use  he reports minimal alcohol usage - one beer per night. He stopped smoking a year ago following advice from his primary care physician. He has not been part of any substance abuse treatment previously.  Presenting Complaint and Clinical Findings:  The patient described his current symptoms as a sudden onset of severe  sharp  and persistent abdominal and back pain which started approximately 12 hours prior to admission. He also complained of associated nausea  which he rated as severe. There was no vomiting  change in bowel or bladder habits  hematuria  or melena.  On examination  he appeared pale and sweaty. His pulse was weak and his blood pressure was difficult to read due to the severity of pain. His pulses were symmetric in his extremities. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile and tender mass in the suprapubic region indicating a possible AAA.  Diagnostic Planning and Findings:  Considering the symptoms  the physical examination  and the patient’s risk factors (age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and a family history of AAA) an immediate decision was taken to get an abdominal CT scan  which confirmed the diagnosis of a 6.8 cm infra-renal AAA. Unfortunately  findings indicated that the AAA was leaking blood into the retroperitoneal space  also known as an impending AAA rupture.   Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery department where an emergency endovascular stent graft repair of the AAA was conducted. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged home on the sixth postoperative day with a follow-up appointment scheduled with his vascular surgeon in a week.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of a high clinical suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients who are male  over 65  smokers or former smokers  have a family history of AAA  and present with sudden abdominal or lower back pain. Timely recognition and referral for emergency surgical intervention can be life-saving. This case also demonstrates the successful application of endovascular stent graft repair as a less invasive treatment option for AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,84,Title: Emergency Management of A Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Senior Patient: A Case Report  Abstract:  This case report demonstrates the detection  emergency management  and successful treatment of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease.  Case Description:  The 80-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  tearful pain at his lower back extending towards his lower abdomen on the left side. His medical history includes hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a 60-pack-year history of smoking. The patient's prior surgical history was unremarkable. Family history revealed that his older brother died earlier from a ruptured AAA.  Examination on objective assessment revealed a diaphoretic  pale  and dyspneic patient with a pulse rate of 110 per minute and blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg. Palpation revealed a pulsatile mass. Laboratory tests displayed evidence of plasma lactate elevation  consistent with generalized ischemia. The initial impression was a ruptured AAA which was confirmed by an urgent CT-angiography  revealing an extensive retroperitoneal hematoma along with an infrarenal AAA measuring 8.5 cm.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for the repair of the AAA. A successful open repair was performed with an infrarenal aortic graft. Postoperatively  the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit where he had healing and recovery complications related to advanced age and cardiovascular morbidity. After the postoperative recovery period  the patient's abdominal and back pain resolved. The patient was evaluated in the vascular surgery clinic on regular follow-ups showing a significant improvement in his health.  Discussion:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) rupture carries high morbidity and mortality rates. Risk factors for AAA include age over 65 years  male sex  a history of smoking  and the presence of familial risk. This case underscored the importance of prompt recognition  decisive management  and the necessary interdisciplinary collaboration in managing the acute presentation of a ruptured AAA.  Conclusions:  This case report highlights both the complexity and urgency in diagnosing and managing AAA rupture. Furthermore  it stresses upon the importance of follow-up care in the postoperative period  especially in dealing with potential complications among aging patients with a complex history of comorbidities.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,85,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Male - A Case Report   Patient Presentation: The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  with a reported history of hypertension and smoking  presented at the emergency department with severe abdominal pain radiating to the back  signs of hypovolemic shock  palpable abdominal mass and tenderness  suggestive of a potential ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Background Information: The patient lived in a suburb and was a retired engineer  with a strong history of smoking for about 30 years although he had quit about 12 years ago. His medical records indicated that he had been diagnosed with non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Further  he had a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including a brother who died of a heart attack at the age of 55.   Clinical Findings: The patient was in severe distress  experiencing dizziness  and shortness of breath. His blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg  and heart rate was 110 bpm. Physical examination showed a pulsatile abdominal mass. The patient’s skin was cold and clammy  indicating signs of shock.   Diagnostic Assessment: A rapid bedside ultrasound was performed  revealing an AAA measuring approximately 7 cm in diameter. Given the patient's symptomatology and ultrasound findings  a presumptive diagnosis of ruptured AAA was made. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis  illustrating a large infrarenal aortic aneurysm with evidence of rupture into the retroperitoneal space.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for an emergency open surgical repair due to the instability of his condition.

Follow-up and Outcome: Post-operative period was uneventful  and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. After 3 days in ICU and 1 week in the surgical ward  he showed significant improvement and was subsequently discharged from the hospital.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the deleterious effects of multiple risk factors such as hypertension  long-term smoking  diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and positive family history on the development and rupture of AAA. This case also highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of AAA to prevent fatal outcomes. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,86,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Male: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report discusses the clinical presentation  diagnosis  intervention  and follow-up of a 70-year-old male patient who presented with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Case Presentation: Patient Description: A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient  resident of a suburban middle-class neighborhood  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe lower abdominal and back pain of 3-hours duration  which he described as the worst pain he has ever experienced. He was a retired engineer  married with two children and a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption.   Medical History: His past medical history was significant for hypertension  which was treated with a calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor. He also had early-stage chronic kidney disease and hyperlipidemia. His familial history was positive for cardiovascular diseases  with his father passing away due to AAA rupture at the age of 67 years old.  On examination  he was in considerable distress  appeared pale and sweaty  with pulse rate 98 beats/min  blood pressure 90/50 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable mass in the midline of the abdomen which was tender on palpation. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: An urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a 7.0 cm AAA with evidence of rupture into the retroperitoneal space.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient received immediate resuscitation and was taken directly to the operating theatre. He underwent successful open surgical repair of the ruptured AAA with a Dacron aortic graft  under general anesthesia. The patient also required four units of red blood cells due to significant intraoperative blood loss.  Follow up and Outcome: Post-surgery  the patient had an uncomplicated recovery. He was transferred to the ward after two days in the intensive care unit and was discharged home ten days later. The patient was scheduled for regular follow-ups with vascular surgery outpatient services.   Conclusion: This case underlines the critical importance of early detection and intervention in patients with AAA  especially those who are at high risk due to familial history or other predisposing factors such as hypertension and atherosclerotic disease.

He experienced a sudden  sharp  tearing sensation that initiated at the navel and radiated towards his back.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Robinson has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  chronic pain due to osteoarthritis  and moderate tobacco usage. He has been treated with antihypertensives and statins for the last ten years. He also had a 38 pack-year smoking history  though he had quit 8 years ago. Mr. Robinson had no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:   Upon physical examination  Mr. Robinson was in obvious distress due to the intense pain. His blood pressure was 180/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 90 beats per minute  temperature 98.6 F  and breaths per minute at 18. An abdominal examination revealed a palpable  pulsating mass in his belly  approximately 5 cm in diameter. The peripheral pulses in the lower extremities were detected and normal.   Diagnostic Assessment:   An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring about 7.4 cm in diameter. The aneurysm was not ruptured but was associated with a moderate amount of free fluid  potentially indicating a contained rupture or imminent rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention:   Given the large size and symptomatic nature of the aneurysm  the patient was transferred immediately to the operating suite for emergency open aneurysm repair. A Dacron graft was used to replace the diseased section of the aorta.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:   Postoperatively  Mr. Robinson's hospital course was uncomplicated. He remained in the hospital for an additional 7 days for acute pain control and to monitor for potential postoperative complications. Upon discharge  he was prescribed analgesics  antihypertensives  and was advised to continue his treatment for hyperlipidemia.  Patient Perspective:   Mr. Robinson was grateful for the immediate diagnosis and treatment. He recognized the need for smoking cessation as a crucial element for vascular health and decided to continue his efforts in maintaining a smoke-free lifestyle.  Informed Consent:  Mr. Robinson gave written informed consent for his case to be presented for academic and educational purposes.  Case Summary:  This case illustrates the presentation and management of a large  symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm in an elderly Caucasian male with strong cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and  importantly  smoking.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,90,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Smoker with Hypertension: A Case Report   I. INTRODUCTION  The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially lethal condition  characterized by a dilated aorta  frequently presenting no signs until rupture occurs. Men aged 60 and above with history of smoking and hypertension are mostly affected. We present the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male smoker  diagnosed with a ruptured AAA and successfully managed with endovascular aortic repair.  II. CASE PRESENTATION  A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented at our emergency department with severe abdominal pain that radiated to his back and slight syncope. The patient was a past active smoker  having quit five years ago after smoking approximately 30-pack years. He has a ten-year history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managing these with Losartan 50mg and Atorvastatin 20mg daily. His family history includes his father  who died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 72. He is a retired electrical engineer  a widower  lives alone  and maintains an active lifestyle.  III. CLINICAL FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  On physical examination  he was pale  sweaty and had a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. His heart rate was 108 beats per minute. On abdominal examination  there was a pulsatile mass in the middle and lower abdomen. A bruit could also be heard over this area. Blood tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL  slightly below the normal range.   Computed Tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen showed a 7.5 cm infrarenal AAA  with evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma  suggestive of an admission diagnosis of ruptured AAA. The patient was informed of the seriousness of his condition and consented to emergency endovascular repair.   IV. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME  The patient was urgently transferred to the hybrid operating room and underwent successful endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) under general anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful and a follow-up CTA demonstrated successful exclusion of the aneurysm without endoleak. Blood transfusion was given postoperatively and his haemoglobin levels were monitored. The patient remained stable and made a gradual recovery. He was discharged on the tenth postoperative day after satisfactory clinical progress.  V. DISCUSSION  This case reflects the silent yet potentially fatal nature of AAAs. It also highlights the importance of patient risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and a positive family history. The use of EVAR was both life-saving and effective in our patient  demonstrating its value in managing such critical conditions.  VI. CONCLUSION  Regular screening in high-risk populations  particularly males over 60 with a history of smoking or hypertension  is crucial to detect AAA early and prevent fatal outcomes. As demonstrated in this case  prompt recognition and management of AAA can lead to satisfying patient outcomes. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,91,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Case Information Patient ID: MRN-5888 Age: 70 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired civil engineer   Presenting complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe  sudden-onset abdominal pain radiating to his back  lasting for 4 hours.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He also has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He has no known allergies. Patient denied any family history of cardiovascular diseases or aortic aneurysms.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient was in distress with blood pressure 160/80mmHg  heart rate 106bpm  respiratory rate 24/min  and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the epigastric region  slightly tender on palpation.  Investigations:  - Laboratory investigations revealed elevated D-dimer levels. Lipid profile was abnormal with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were low. Blood glucose and HbA1c levels were uncontrolled. - Abdominal ultrasound revealed a low echogenic mass approximately 7 cm in diameter  suggestive of an aortic aneurysm. - A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed a 7.3 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Treatment and Outcome: Given the large size of the aneurysm and the acute presentation  the patient was recommended for an urgent surgical repair. He underwent a successful endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. He was discharged on the 5th postoperative day on blood pressure maintenance  blood glucose control  and lipid-lowering medications. On a 1-month follow-up visit  CT angiogram showed no leak  and the graft was patent.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of AAA  particularly in those with risk factors such as advanced age  male sex  smoking history  and diseases like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Despite having major conventional risk factors  the patient did not have any previous ultrasonographic surveillance for AAA. Strict blood pressure control  glycemic control  lipid-lowering therapies  and quit smoking can be beneficial in limiting the growth of small AAAs.  Conclusion: Early diagnosis and proactive management of AAA in high-risk individuals can significantly reduce the risk of dreadful complications such as rupture and death. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,92,Title: An Unusual Presentation of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  categorically a disease of the aging population  poses a grave health concern among males older than 65 years. The disease has a strong predilection for males  with a male-to-female ratio averaging approximately 4:1. We document here a remarkable case involving a 78-year-old male with an asymptomatic AAA discovered during a routine physical examination.  Case Presentation: The patient  Mr. W  is a 78-year-old Caucasian male with a history of controlled hypertension  moderate hyperlipidaemia  and type 2 diabetes  all of which had been well managed with medication. He was an ex-smoker  with a smoking history of 20 pack-years  but had quit around two decades ago. There was no family history of vascular disease.  Mr. W visited the hospital for an annual checkup. The patient had no complaints and specifically denied any abdominal pain  back pain  limb weakness  urinary or bowel incontinence  or unexplained weight loss. His body mass index was 26.8. Vital signs were normal  and a routine physical examination noted a vague pulsatile mass in the abdomen.  An abdominal ultrasonography was ordered  revealing a dilated infrarenal aortic diameter of 5.2 cm consistent with an AAA. Confirmatory computed tomographic angiography of the abdomen showed a 5.2 cm infrarenal AAA without any signs of rupture or leak.  Due to the size of the AAA  the patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery for further evaluation and management. Open repair surgery was deemed suitable based on the patient's overall low surgical risk and aneurysm morphology.  The patient experienced no postoperative complications  and the aneurysm was successfully repaired. Management of his hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  diabetes  and secondary prevention efforts were also addressed by the general practitioners following the operation.  Discussion: This case is characteristic of the 'silent' nature of AAAs  often asymptomatic until rupture. It emphasises the importance of routine physical examination  particularly among older males and those with risk factors like hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  and smoking history. In the older demographic  family physicians play a pivotal role in early detection and timely referrals to vascular surgery. This case also underscores the critical nature of managing comorbidities that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AAA and its complications.  Conclusion: Given the silent course and potential lethal outcome of ruptured AAA  primary care providers need to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients like Mr. W who carry significant risk factors. Appropriate imaging modalities  risk assessment  surgical evaluations  and close follow-up care are essential aspects of managing patients with AAA  and may influence the overall prognosis positively. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,93,Title: Management of Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 76-Year-Old Asian Female: A Single Case Report  Introduction:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular condition characterized by a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta  potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as rupture if left untreated.  CASE REPORT  Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 76-year-old Asian female who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with a one-day history of severe abdominal pain. The pain started suddenly  was constant  and radiated to her lower back. The patient also reported feelings of light-headedness but denied any associated chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  or vomiting. The patient also had a previous history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared in pain and distress. Her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg  a pulse rate of 105 beats per minute  and 21 respirations per minute. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid-epigastric region  and the patient was tender on deep palpation along the abdominal aorta.   relevant investigations:  Emergency Hematology and Biochemistry labs were within reasonable limits except for raised white cell count and C-reactive protein suggesting an inflammatory process. An urgent Abdominal CT angiogram revealed a 6.8 cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta with signs of rupture.  Management:  The patient was immediately admitted to intensive care and treated for shock. Following resuscitation  she underwent an emergency endovascular stent grafting operation. The operation was successful  and the patient was kept in the ICU for monitoring.  Outcome:  Post-operatively  the patient’s vitals stabilized  and the abdominal pain resolved. The patient was discharged on post-operative day 10  with outpatient follow-ups planned with the vascular surgery team.  Discussion:  AAA is more commonly observed in older white men. However  this case highlights the occurrence of ruptured AAA in an elderly Asian female  for whom AAA is reported at a lower prevalence. The traditional risk factors  such as hypertension and high cholesterol levels  were present in this case. This case underscores the importance of considering AAA in elderly patients with risk factors presenting with abdominal pain  backed up with a focused history and physical examination to reduce morbidity and mortality.   Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Conclusion:  This case underscores that though AAA is less common in women and the Asian population  it can occur and clinician vigilance is required  particularly in the presence of risk factors and presenting symptoms suggestive of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,94,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an 80-year-old Male with Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia: A Case Report  Introduction:   Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilation of the aorta in the abdomen  which carries a high risk of rupture with grave medical prognosis. This case report describes an 80-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with an AAA.  Patient Profile:  The patient is an 80-year-old Caucasian male residing in a suburban setting. He is a retired mechanical engineer with a smoking history of 40-pack years  but quit 10 years ago. His family history is noted for myocardial infarction in his father and grandfather. The patient lives independently  remains physically active and consumes low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol. He has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication.  Medical History:   The patient’s medical history includes Stage 2 hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  for which he is prescribed lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with atorvastatin. The patient has not previously been diagnosed with any form of aneurysm or cardiac condition. He has no known allergies and his last physical examination  conducted a month prior  was unremarkable barring the hypertensive range BP readings.  Presenting Problem:   The patient presented at the outpatient department with a complaint of persistent abdominal discomfort  mild back pain  and loss of weight over the past three months. These symptoms had progressively worsened over the past week.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  a pulsatile mass was noted in the periumbilical area. Percussion confirmed dullness over the same area. Detailed vascular and abdominal examinations did not report any other abnormal findings. Routine labs were within normal limits  except for marginally elevated LDL and triglycerides.  Investigations:  The ultrasound of the abdomen revealed an aneurysmal aortic dilation measuring 5.8 cm in maximum diameter. This finding was further confirmed by a CT scan with contrast. It displayed an AAA with an infrarenal location with no signs of rupture or dissection.  Conclusion:  The patient’s age  Caucasian ethnicity  and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  along with his extensive smoking history  are all significant risk factors making him susceptible to AAA.  Following the diagnosis of the AAA  the patient was counseled regarding the risks and complications of the aneurysm and potential therapeutic options. Since the diameter of the aneurysm was >5.5 cm  surgical intervention was recommended to prevent a possible rupture.  This report underscores the importance of considering a diagnosis of AAA even in elderly patients presenting with vague symptoms such as persistent abdominal discomfort and unexplained weight loss. Early detection can facilitate necessary surgical intervention and prevent life-threatening complications.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,98,**Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)**  **Patient Information**  Mr. A. McCarthy is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired heavy equipment operator  with a medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Lives alone  has a daughter living out of state  and no reported family history of cardiovascular disease.  **Clinical Findings**  The patient initially presented at a primary healthcare center complaining of persistent lower abdominal and back pain  discomfort  bloating  and vague nausea for two weeks  but no vomiting  loss of appetite  or weight loss. He mentioned progressive intensification of his pain over the last two days.  **Diagnostic Assessment**  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Further diagnostic testing with abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm  primarily infrarenal  measured 5.5 cm with a mural thrombus. No sign of imminent rupture was reported.  Complete blood count  renal function tests  and liver function tests were all within normal limits. Urinalysis also did not show any significant abnormalities. ECG showed no sign of ischemic heart disease.  **Therapeutic Intervention**  Given the presence of a large aneurysm  surgical intervention was deemed necessary and an attempt was made to regulate the hypertension. Immediate blood pressure management was initiated with IV labetalol  and he was shifted to a high dependency unit for close monitoring.  The patient underwent elective endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). Preoperative workup ensured that the patient had adequate renal function and was optimized from a cardiovascular perspective. The surgery was uneventful  and immediate post-procedure CTA confirmed successful graft placement with no endoleak.  **Follow-Up and Outcomes**  Mr. McCarthy remained in the hospital for 72 hours under close observation and was discharged on the fourth day  when his pain was under control and his blood pressure was stable. His anti-hypertensive medication was reviewed and titrated before discharge. He was advised to quit smoking and was provided with smoking cessation resources and lifestyle modification education.  During his one-month follow-up visit  the patient reported a significant reduction in his symptoms. An outpatient CTA was repeated three months post-operatively and showed patent graft with no endoleak. He was followed up regularly at the vascular surgery clinic for further evaluation and monitoring.  **Patient Perspective**  The patient expressed his gratitude for the successful intervention  stating that his quality of life had improved greatly since the procedure. He shared that he'd successfully quit smoking and was adapting a healthier lifestyle.  **Informed Consent**  Informed consent was obtained from the patient for this case report.   This 68-year-old man’s case underscores the importance of considering AAA in older patients with risk factors (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking) who present with non-specific abdominal symptoms. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention can potentially prevent catastrophic consequences  significantly improving patient outcomes.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,99,Title: A Case of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Male  Introduction:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are a potentially fatal condition that predominantly affects males over the age of 60. Herein  we present an interesting case of AAA managing the condition non-surgically due to patient choice.  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male retired construction worker from a semi-urban area. He is a smoker with a history of 30 pack-years. Utility working exposed him to prolonged periods of standing and heavy lifting. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient lives with his wife and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father passing from an aortic aneurysm. He reported moderate alcohol consumption and follows an inconsistent exercise regimen.  Clinical findings: He presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of persistent lower back pain for about three weeks that radiates to the legs and dull aching abdominal pain. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile and tender mass in the lower abdomen.  Diagnostic assessment: An abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed a fusiform aneurysm of the abdominal aorta measuring 6.2 cm in diameter  indicative of an AAA. A complete blood count  metabolic panel  and coagulation functions were within normal ranges.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was immediately registered under vascular surgery upon diagnosis. However  upon discussion of risks and benefits  the patient declined surgical intervention. A conservative management plan was initiated including smoking cessation counseling  blood pressure optimization with beta-blockers  and tight glycemic control. The patient was also encouraged to modify lifestyle choices  reduce alcohol intake  follow a balanced diet  and engage in light physical activities.  Follow-up and outcomes: He was scheduled for close follow-up appointments including regular ultrasound examinations. Over six months  the aneurysm remained stable without any further enlargement. However  the patient continues to experience intermittent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort.  Patient perspective: The patient expressed concern about his diagnosis but chose non-operative management out of fear of surgical complications. He shared his commitment to lifestyle modification and compliance with medications to control his blood pressure and diabetes.  Discussion: For AAA  early detection and prompt management are crucial. Although surgical intervention is usually preferred for AAAs greater than 5.5 cm  patient choice plays a significant role in management. This case underlines the significance of conservative management when surgical intervention is refused or contraindicated.  Conclusion: Despite the standard management for AAA being surgical intervention  this case underscores the potential role and necessity of yet vigilant conservative management in the setting of patient refusal for surgery. Physicians must be prepared to discuss all potential options and respect patient autonomy in treatment decisions. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,7,100,Title: Rapid Growth of An Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  I. Patient Information  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. X  weighing approximately 75 kg  and measuring 175 cm in height. He is retired and lives with his wife in a small town. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He has no known drug allergies.  II. Chief Complaint  The patient complained of persistent lower back pain extending down towards the abdomen  with the frequency and intensity increasing over the past two weeks.  III. Past medical history  Mr. X was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and type 2 diabetes 10 years ago  both of which have been managed with medication. Additionally  he had been treated for hyperlipidemia for the past 12 years. There is no history of previous surgeries. He underwent coronary angioplasty 5 years ago following a minor myocardial infarction. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease: his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his older brother underwent surgery for a cerebral aneurysm.  IV. Clinical Findings  On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was noted  and a bruit was heard over the mass. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The patient appeared in no acute distress  with normal vital signs.  V. Diagnostic Assessment  Abdominal ultrasound suggested the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan  which revealed a large AAA measuring approximately 5.5 cm in diameter.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention  Due to the large size and continued growth of the aneurysm  the patient was admitted for emergency surgery. An endovascular stent graft was inserted successfully with no complications.  VII. Follow-up and Disposition  Post-operative recovery was uneventful. He was discharged from the hospital after one week. Medications for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes were adjusted. Mr. X was advised to quit alcohol consumption  and he was referred to a physiotherapist for physical rehabilitation. A CT scan after six months revealed the absence of an endoleak  and the stent graft was in the correct position.   This case illustrates the importance of periodic abdominal examinations in high-risk patients  even in the absence of symptoms  for early diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,1,Patient Profile: The patient  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  was presented with a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is a retired engineer living with his wife in San Francisco  California. He has a history of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease for which he is on medication. He is a former smoker  quitting 15 years ago  and does not have a history of alcohol or drug abuse.   Medical History: The patient has been managing hypertension and coronary artery disease for over a decade  which were controlled through medication. He has a surgical history including appendectomy and coronary bypass grafting done almost 15 years ago.   Approximately 11 years ago  he was diagnosed as Borderline Diabetic but was well-managed through dietary adjustments  and does not require insulin currently. His other past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia. There is no history of any renal  hepatic or other systemic disease.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at an age of 74 and his mother died from complications of diabetes. Besides that  no other significant family history of aneurysms mentioned.  Presenting Condition: He visited for a routine check-up where he complained of a dull  gnawing feeling of discomfort in his lower back and abdomen. During examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the abdomen. He reported no other symptoms such as weight loss  loss of appetite  or changes in bowel habits.  Investigations: The physician ordered an abdominal ultrasound to investigate this mass further. The ultrasound revealed an AAA measuring approximately 5.5cms in diameter.   Discussion: AAA is more common in men than women and the risk increases with age  especially in those over 65. AAA is more common among Caucasians than it is among African-Americans  Latinos  and Asians. Screening examinations for AAA is recommended for men between 65-75 who have ever smoked.  There are strong associations with AAA and coronary artery disease  hypertension  high cholesterol and smoking. Our patient had all these risk factors.   Plan: As the patient's AAA was greater than 5.5cm  multidisciplinary team decided surgical intervention was needed. They planned an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure which is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time compared to traditional open surgery. Alongside the surgery  managing other risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and monitoring sugar levels was agreed upon.   Post-EVAR  regular follow-ups with ultrasound or CT scans will be done to ensure the aneurysm has been successfully repaired and to continually monitor the patient's overall health status.   This case highlights the importance of regular health checkups in early detection and management of life-threatening conditions such as an AAA  especially in patients with multiple risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,2,Patient Profile:  Patient's Name: Mr. James Waters Age: 70 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer  Medical Case Presentation:  Mr. James Waters  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the outpatient department with a complaint of persistent abdominal pain for the past two weeks. The pain was described as a dull ache  concentrated in the central and lower part of the abdomen. On further inquiry  the patient also reported occasional back pain  but no change in bowel or bladder habits.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Waters has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are controlled on medication for the past 10 years. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty and is on regular follow-up. He continues to take the prescribed medication regularly  including antiplatelets  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins. He has no known drug allergies. He has never been hospitalized outside of his myocardial infarction.   Lifestyle and Family History:  He is a former smoker  having quit 25 years ago. He occasionally drinks alcohol but does not engage in any recreational drug use. He is moderately active and follows a relatively healthy diet.   His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father died at the age of 65 from a stroke  and his older brother underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 68.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis:  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. His blood pressure was found to be elevated  inconsistent with his regular medication. Due to the suspicious abdominal findings and his significant family history  an ultrasound was carried out which confirmed the presence of an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  This finding was subsequently verified by a computed tomographic angiogram (CTA)  showing a 5.5 cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  With the establishment of his diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  a treatment plan concerning surgical intervention is under discussion  however  the risks associated with his previous cardiac issues need careful consideration.  In summary  Mr. Waters presents a potentially complex case due to his previous cardiac history. Given the significant size of the aneurysm and the potential for rupture  immediate steps to arrange surgical intervention need to be undertaken  with careful preoperative cardiac evaluation. Multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiology  radiology  and vascular surgery teams will play a vital role in the successful management of Mr. Waters' condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,3,Subject: 65-year-old African-American Male with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Presenting Patient Profile: Our patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He weighs about 79 kg and his height is approximately 178 cm. He comes from an urban socioeconomic background and is a retired construction worker. His main concern was progressive abdominal discomfort with intermittent lower back pain over the last couple of months.  Past Medical History: The patient has been a hypertensive for the past 10 years and his BP has been fairly controlled on ACE inhibitors. He has a documented history of hyperlipidemia and has been on statins for the same. In addition  he has a 20-year history of smoking  although he quit 5 years ago. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He denied other known cardiovascular or metabolic disease.  Family History: The patient's father died at 70 due to a stroke. His mother  85  is alive and suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He also reported an uncle who underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 68.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was found to have a noticeable pulsating mass in the abdomen. His blood pressure was slightly elevated 145/90 mmHg. His routine laboratory studies showed dyslipidemia with LDL cholesterol being quite high.  Radiological Evaluation: A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It reveals a 5.5 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm without signs of rupture or dissection.  Treatment and Follow-up: Since his aortic aneurysm is about 5.5 cm in diameter and he is symptomatic  he will be considered for surgical repair to reduce the risk of rupture. He will continue his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications to manage the risk factors for AAA growth. The team will schedule him for annual surveillance with abdominal ultrasonography.  Risk Factors:   Epidemiological data suggest that the risk factors for the development of AAA in this patient could have been his age  male sex  Caucasian race  smoking history  chronic hypertension  and genetic predisposition.  General Demographics: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are most commonly diagnosed in elderly men  with the prevalence increasing with age. AAAs are more common among Caucasians compared to African Americans. However  the outcome post AAA rupture is worse in African Americans  making this case quite noteworthy. Risk factors include smoking  hypertension  and a family history of the condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,4,Patient Information:  Mr. R is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who has visited the Outpatient Department due to worsening abdominal pain over the last week. He resides in rural Tennessee  lives alone  and is a retired teacher.   Presenting Issue:   Mr. R informed us that he has been experiencing dull  constant abdominal pain for over a week  which seemed to be intensifying. He also mentioned feeling a pulsating sensation around his navel.  Past Medical History:  Mr. R’s medical history reveals controlled hypertension and a 10-year smoking history  which he quit approximately five years ago. He has a history of a mild heart attack 5 years ago and is on aspirin 75mg/OD for the same.  Family History:   Both his father and older brother had abdominal aortic aneurysms diagnosed in their later life. His father passed away at the age of 79 from aneurysm-related complications.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  he was alert and fully grounded in reality. His blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg with pulse rate 70 bpm. Abdomen was soft  non-tender but a palpable pulsatile mass is noted in the infra-umbilical region.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  His symptoms  family history  and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass  Mr. R seemed to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Investigations:  An abdominal ultrasound confirmed a 5.2cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. CT angiogram also supports the same diagnosis; it showed a saccular infrarenal aneurysm with no signs of rupture.  Treatment:  Considering his age  previous medical history  symptomatology  and size of the aneurysm  Mr. R has been referred for repair of the aneurysm. Given the scenario  an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) would be planned.  Conclusion:  Given Mr. R's demographics  history  and current presentation  it was essential to diagnose and treat his condition promptly to prevent life-threatening complications. The patient's age  gender  hypertension  smoking history  and familial history align with the current literature concerning risk factors associated with the occurrence of AAA. Early detection and timely intervention can potentially improve the prognosis for patients like Mr. R.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,5,Patient Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. Johnson Brown  a 67-year-old African American male  was brought into the emergency room after complaining of severe lower back and abdominal pain for the past week.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Brown experienced sharp and radiating pain in his lower abdomen and back which he initially attributed to muscle strain. However  the extreme intensity and steady increase of the pain over time prompted him to seek medical attention.  Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was diagnosed with these conditions 15 years ago and has been on regular medication (ACE inhibitors  statins  and bronchodilators respectively). Mr. Brown was a smoker and consumed nearly a pack daily for about 40 years. He quit smoking 10 years ago.  Family History: His father died from stroke at 72 and his older brother had undergone a successful operation for the same condition—abdominal aortic aneurysm— three years prior. His mother has a history of hypertension and died of heart disease in her eighties.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  a pulsating mass was recorded in the abdomen. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mm Hg. Other vital signs were stable.  Investigations: An ultrasound confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm in the infrarenal aorta region. A CT angiography was done as a follow-up to map the detailed anatomy of the aneurysm.  Disease Prevalence: The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is higher in males and increases with age. It is more common in the white population but is found to be more severe with poorer outcomes in African Americans. As validated by Khashram  Williman  and Jones (2016)  contributing factors include smoking  familial history  and heart disease.  Management: The patient's aneurysm falls into the category that needs surgical repair due to its size and risk of rupture. After consulting with the vascular department  an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was scheduled.  Conclusion: The presence of multiple risk factors such as age  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history made Mr. Brown prone to developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Monitoring his vital signs for stability and controlling the blood pressure are crucial steps while arranging for the surgery. He would also benefit from lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet  regular exercise  and regular monitoring of his lipid profile and blood pressure after the surgery.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,6,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Williams is a 70-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history until he stopped five years ago. He was referred to the vascular surgery clinic for an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on a recent abdominal ultrasound  which was carried out because he had complained of chronic  dull abdominal pain. His family history is significant for his father and older brother both succumbing to AAA ruptures. He takes losartan for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. Williams is slightly overweight (BMI: 26)  with stable vital signs. His abdominal examination showed a pulsatile mass near the umbilicus  with no overlying erythema or tenderness. He also has no sign of lower extremity edema or peripheral arterial disease. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment and Outcome:  A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed a 5.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no signs of impending rupture. Given the size of the aneurysm and the family history  Mr. Williams was counseled for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) which he agreed to. The procedure was carried out successfully with no immediate post-operative complications. Mr. Williams was discharged three days after the procedure  with orders to continue taking his antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic medications. He was also advised for regular follow-up and imaging to monitor for potential aneurysm expansion or other complications.  Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease that often has no symptoms until rupture  at which point the survival rate is low. The risk factors include advanced age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  family history of AAA  and Caucasian race - although recent research suggests that African-Americans may also be significantly affected. Intervention is generally recommended when the aneurysm reaches exceed 5.5cm  presents with rapid enlargement  or is symptomatic  as in this case. EVAR has greatly reduced perioperative mortality rates  but long-term surveillance is critical due to the risk of endoleaks and aneurysm expansion. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,7,Patient Presentation:  Introduction: Mr. Alvarez is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presented with acute onset of severe lower abdomen and back pain. His pain was not associated with any triggering factors and was constant  which is unlike any previous experiences.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history. Previous surgeries include appendectomy and bilateral hernia repairs in his 50s. Mr. Alvarez's medications include Enalapril and Atorvastatin. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: His father died at 72 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  and his mother died from breast cancer in her 60s.  Symptoms: Mr. Alvarez admits he has felt a pulsating sensation in his abdomen in recent months  often associated with a slight discomfort  which he ignored. He does not report any weight loss  loss of appetite  or change in bowel habits.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  he appears chronically ill and stated that he has severe pain. His BP was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 100/min  and respiratory rate 18/min. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsating mass in the periumbilical region.  Radiology: A CT scan revealed a 7.2-cm infrarenal AAA with no sign of rupture but evidence of impending rupture.   Diagnosis: Considering his symptomatology  physical examination findings  and radiological evidence  he was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm with an impending rupture.  Plan: An anticipated plan consists of immediate surgical repair  either via open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  depending on further assessment by the vascular surgical team.   The patient has several risk factors associated with AAA  such as older age  male sex  a strong family history of AAA  smoking history  and concomitant disease like hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  In conclusion  the patient has an identified AAA  which was discovered due to acute onset of severe pain. Given the patient's significant family history and his smoking habit  extra vigilance  and regular check-ups have been recommended for quick detection and early intervention of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,8,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-Year-Old Male  Patient Information:   Mr. T  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented with complaints of intermittent unrelenting abdominal pain and episodes of lightheadedness.  Clinical History:   Our patient  Mr. T  has a past medical history significant for smoking a pack per day for 30 years (quit 10 years ago)  diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension under treatment. The patient lives alone and has been maintaining his lifestyle with moderate exercise and balanced diet.  Family Medical History:   Mr. T has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his younger brother was detected with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at age 60.  Presenting Complaints:   The patient complains of an unusual pulsating sensation in the abdomen corresponding to his heartbeat  accompanied by throbbing lower back pain.  Physical Examination:   On examination  his vital signs were stable but he had a palpable abdominal mass that pulsed with the heartbeat. Blood pressure was slightly elevated on the higher side - 150/95 mmHg  with a heart rate of 82 beats/minute.  Investigation findings:  Abdominal ultrasounds demonstrated an infrarenal AAA of 5.5 cm. CT angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm arising from the infrarenal aorta.  Management system:  Given the size of the aneurysm and symptoms  surgical intervention was advised. Elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was carried out  which was successful.   Discussion:  AAA is predominantly observed in older adults  especially men over 60  Caucasian ethnicity  smokers  and individuals with a family history of the condition  which matches our patient's demographic profile. Hypertension and smoking history are major risk factors. The importance of proactive screening and timely interventions in patients at risk of AAA is emphasized by this case. The case also highlights the usage of EVAR for treatment  with less invasiveness and a quicker recovery time than open surgery.   References:  No specific references are included as this based on a hypothetical case. However  for a real case  related peer-reviewed papers and textbooks would be cited.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,9,Patient Presentation:  Name: John C. Doe Age: 67 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Police Officer  History of Present Illness: Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe abdominal pain which he described as constant  gnawing  and radiating to the back. The patient reports that his discomfort has been progressive over the last four hours. He denies any other associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or diarrhea; however  he mentioned a recent unexplained weight loss and mild fatigue over the past month. History of previous surgical interventions is insignificant.  Medical History: The past medical history revealed he had high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels for the past 15 years  managed with medication. The patient is also a 20-pack year smoker and has been quitting and starting smoking throughout his lifetime. He also has a 10-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus under control with Metformin.  Family History: He had a paternal uncle who died of a stroke in his early 70s  and his father had congestive heart failure in his late seventies. His mother and two siblings are alive and well  with no known hereditary illnesses.   Psychosocial History: Mr. Doe resides with his wife and they are both retired. He enjoyed a moderate alcohol intake  with approximately 2 beers a night  but he quit drinking six months ago on his physician's advice.  Physical Examination: Vital signs demonstrate a blood pressure of 147/88 mmhg and a pulse rate of 86 bpm. His cardiovascular examination showed normal heart sounds without any murmurs. However  palpation revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Bowel sounds were present  and the remainder of his physical examination was normal.  Assessment: Based on the clinical signs  symptoms and medical history  he was suspected of having an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An aorta ultrasound confirmed a 7cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery for further management given the size of his AAA and his symptoms  which suggested potential imminent rupture.  Plan: A plan was made to admit the patient and arrange an elective repair of his aneurysm. His management will also include optimization of his blood pressure and lipid levels and smoking cessation counseling to potentially limit the expansion of his aneurysm.  This case serves as a potent reminder that high clinical suspicion for AAA is needed  especially in patients over 65 years of age with smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and family history of aneurysm or strokes. Early diagnosis and management can prevent a fatal rupture event.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,12,Title: Elderly Hypertensive Male with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  living in rural Midwestern America. He has been a lifetime non-smoker and has moderate alcohol consumption habits. The patient has a known history of hypertension  for which he is on medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). He has no history of diabetes or dyslipidemia and lives a moderately active lifestyle.   Medical History:  In addition to hypertension  the patient has a history of prostate cancer treated by radiation therapy eight years ago. He reports being in remission following therapy. His father had a history of coronary artery disease and died of a myocardial infarction in his late sixties. The patient’s mother lived into her late eighties and had a history of stroke. There is no familial history of any kind of aneurysm. The patient has two elder brothers both in their late seventies  with no major health concerns.   Presenting Problem:  The patient was referred for a routine screening ultrasound of the abdomen owing to his advancing age and history of hypertension. The radiologist identified an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 4.5cm in diameter and referred the patient back to his primary care physician  who ordered a CT scan to further examine the aneurysm.   Additional Findings:  This test confirmed the presence of the aneurysm. Furthermore  it demonstrated that the aneurysm was situated infra-renally  with no sign of rupture or leakage. Physical examination of the patient revealed no abdominal pain or discomfort  no back pain  and no pulsatile abdominal mass. The patient had a healthy BMI of 24 and appeared to be in good general health.  Recommendations:  Given the size of the aneurysm  the patient does not currently meet criteria for surgical repair (>5.5cm). Instead  the patient should have regular surveillance via ultrasound every 6-12 months to monitor the aneurysm's size. He should continue his hypertensive medicine and encourage an active lifestyle. Counseling may be advisable for the associated psychological distress.  In Summary:  An infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was detected in a 72-year-old hypertensive man during a routine ultrasound screening. The aneurysm is currently 4.5cm in diameter and shows no signs of rupture. Non-surgical treatment  aimed primarily at monitoring  is recommended at this time. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,13,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Mr. Diaz  a 70-year-old Hispanic male  retired mechanic from Texas  presented to the clinic with pain in his lower back and abdomen. He is a smoker with a history of high blood pressure and carries a BMI of 28. He consumes alcohol only socially and denies any use of illicit substances. He lives with his wife of 45 years and has two grown-up children. There is a family history of cardiovascular disorders; his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 76 and one of his brothers was recently diagnosed with a peripheral artery disease.

Working Diagnosis: Based on his clinical symptoms  family history  physical examination  and ultrasound scan  Mr. Diaz was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management: A surgical consultation was arranged considering the size of the aneurysm and patient's symptoms. The surgeon explained that treatment options include open surgical repair or an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) - a less invasive procedure. Lifestyle changes were also emphasized  such as smoking cessation and blood pressure control.  Patient's Progress: Mr. Diaz elected to proceed with EVAR  which was successful without any complications. The patient is scheduled for follow-up visits with vascular surgery every six months to monitor his aneurysm via ultrasound. He has enrolled in smoking cessation and diet and exercise programs offered by the clinic and has been prescribed medication for improved control of his blood pressure. Presently  Mr. Diaz reports no issues of abdominal pain and is pursuing a healthier lifestyle.  Conclusion: Mr. Diaz's case has been crucial in understanding the early detection importance and accurate management of abdominal aortic aneurysms  considering the risk factors such as family history  advanced age  and smoking. The entire healthcare team will continue to work closely with him  ensuring constant monitoring and lifestyle changes to prevent recurrence in the future.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,14,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Patient X is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   Demographics:  He is living in a rural community of Oklahoma  USA  and is a retired mechanical engineer. He has been a smoker for the past 50 years but is trying to quit currently.  Past Medical History:  Patient X had been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years for which he takes regular antihypertensive medication. He has a history of hypercholesterolemia but refuses the use of statins due to previous experiences of side effects. His medical history also reveals diabetic mellitus (Type 2) which he manages with oral hypoglycemics. Other past medical events include a femoral hernia repair done 8 years ago.   Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 66  and his mother is currently alive at the age of 98 with no known cardiac disease but suffers from old age-related dementia. His paternal uncle had passed away from an untreated AAA rupture.   Present Health Status: The patient confirms he has been experiencing intermittent mild abdominal discomfort and lower back pain. These symptoms have alarmed him due to his family history of AAA. He denies trauma  bowel changes  gastroenteritis symptoms  urinary changes  or any other systemic symptoms.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass can be felt. However  examination findings might not be accurate due to his high BMI causing difficulty feeling the AAA. As such  an ultrasound was conducted  which confirmed the presence of an AAA of approximately 5.6 cm in diameter. Lab results indicate borderline glycemic control and slightly elevated lipid profile.   Management and Conclusion: The size of the aneurysm suggests an impending risk of rupture that calls for surgical intervention. Considering his age  family history  smoking status  the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia  Patient X should be referred to vascular surgery for evaluation for potential repair. His management will also involve discussions about smoking cessation  improved control of his blood glucose levels  his blood pressure  and a reluctance to use statins.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,15,Patient Identification: Mr. John  67-year-old male  Presenting Conditions: He arrived at the clinic complaining of consistent  dull abdominal pain and occasional lower back pain. These symptoms have been ongoing for a few weeks.  Past Medical History: Mr. John has been hypertensive for six years  actively managed through a regimen of antihypertensives. His additional medical history involves hyperlipidemia and mild renal impairment 5 years ago. The patient is an ex-smoker with a 30 pack-year history  having stopped smoking about ten years ago.  Family History: His father passed away from heart disease in his early 70s. His mother is alive and in her early 90s  suffering from dementia.  Physical Exam: On examination  the patient appeared comfortable but slightly anxious. Abdominal palpation revealed a large  pulsating mass consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was afebrile  his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/80 mmHg  and his heart rate at rest was 80 bpm. No peripheral edema was noticed  and both pulses in the lower extremities were felt equally and strongly.  Inferences: Given the clinical findings and the patient's medical history  the possible diagnosis was an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which was inherent with a high possibility of rupture due to the patient's history of hypertension and smoking. The consistent abdominal pain experienced by Mr. John may be due to the increased pressure on neighboring organs caused by the aneurysm. Also  his age and gender correlate with demographic trends of AAA  which is more commonly found in men over the age of 65.  Management and Follow-up: Immediate intervention was deemed necessary due to the high risk of rupture. Therefore  an urgent CT scan was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and ascertain the size of the aneurysm. Thereafter  surgical intervention (either open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair) would be performed according to the characteristics of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health status.  The risk of rupture for AAAs increases significantly when their size exceeds 5.5 cm or if there is rapid expansion over a short period of time (more than 1 cm per year). In the patient's subsequent care  lifestyle adjustments like healthy diet  exercise  and stress management are crucial  considering his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  With Mr. John's consent  his case was discussed with the surgery team and plans were made to proceed with the optimal treatment plan based on his scan results.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,16,Patient Profile:  Mr. John  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department in our facility with complaints of abdominal pain and discomfort.  Relevant Demographics: - Age: 72   - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Living Environment: He lives alone in his home since his wife passed away. His closest kin is his daughter who lives in another city.  Past Medical History: Mr. John has a 20-year history of hypertension and a documented 15-year history of hyperlipidemia. He's been fairly compliant with his anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. However  his lifestyle includes a lack of adequate physical activity and a diet high in saturated fats. He also has a significant history of smoking  about 30 pack-years (1 pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years). He has no known drug allergies.   Family History: His father had a stroke at 70 and his mother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture quite late in her life. There’s no other significant family history of any cardiac disease.   Observational findings: During physical examination  he was found to have a pulsatile mass in his abdomen. The abdominal pain was determined to be non-radiating but was located in the central lower region of the abdomen. There were no signs of inflammation or infection in the region. His blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 mmHg  and his BMI was 29  indicating obesity.  Investigations: After an Ultrasound confirmed a sizable aneurysm in the abdominal aorta  a CT angiogram was carried out showing an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring about 5.5 cm in maximum diameter. The aneurysm showed no signs of rupture or leak.  Treatment: Based on his symptomatic presentation and the size of the aneurysm  surgical intervention was suggested  alongside conservative management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He quit smoking with regular follow-ups and counseling.  In summary  Mr. John's case is typical for an abdominal aortic aneurysm patient: elderly  male  with a history of heart-related conditions and smoking. His lifestyle choices and family history also put him at increased risk.  Discussion: Mr. John’s case a classic example of demographics implicated in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). Studies show a strong correlation between AAA and males over 65 years  particularly those who are Caucasian  with a smoking history or a familial disposition. Other risk factors like hyperlipidemia  hypertension  atherosclerosis  and obesity also contribute to his chances of having an AAA. Given his current status  comprehensive care is important to prolong his life and improve its quality. His family history makes it integral to educate immediate family members about AAA risks and preventive measures. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,17,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer  recently diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication. He is a moderate smoker  with 25 pack-years of smoking history. He does not consume alcohol or engage in any physical activity. Family history reveals that his father and elder brother also had AAA  presenting similarly in their late 60s.   Presentation: Post retirement  the patient presented to the clinic with complaints of a dull  constant  and severe abdominal pain that had been consistent for the past week. Added to these symptoms were episodes of intermittent claudication and recent unexplained weight loss. Central to his concerns was that the symptoms were similar to those experienced by his father and brother.   Clinical Examination and Investigations: On examination  he was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass. Subsequent abdominal ultrasonography revealed a well-defined aneurysm of 5.5cm in the infra-renal portion of his abdominal aorta. Further duplex scanning confirmed the site and size of the aneurysm. Laboratory investigations showed a mildly elevated white cell count and lipid profile  other parameters were within normal limits.   Diagnosis: With a positive family history  clinical and imaging results  a diagnosis of familial AAA was made.   Patient Management: Given his age  existing comorbid conditions  malignancy of the AAA  the risk factor of smoking  and familial tendency  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was considered as the most suitable treatment option. However  the patient has been briefed on the benefits and risks associated with EVAR vs. open repair. As he was a moderate smoker  nicotine replacement therapy was also recommended to help him stop smoking.  Prognosis and follow-up: Given his general health and the success rate of EVAR  the prognosis is good. However  he has been advised that close surveillance is necessary post-EVAR because of the risk of endoleak or aneurysm expansion. He will also need to make lifestyle modifications  including maintaining a heart-healthy diet  controlling hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and discontinuing smoking.  This case highlights the interplay of genetic predisposition  lifestyle factors  and aging in the manifestation of AAA. It exhibits the importance of early detection  proper diagnostic measures  and patient-centered management strategies that contribute to improved patient outcomes. It also underlines the importance of lifestyle modifications and systemic disease control in managing AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,18,Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile:  Mr. D is a 70-year-old African American man with a past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and a 30-pack year smoking history. He lives in suburban America and is a retired mechanic.  Presenting Issue:  He presented to his primary care physician with complaints of intermittent  non-radiating  dull abdominal pain for the past two weeks. The pain seemed unrelated to food intake and was not accompanied by any other symptoms.  Past Medical History:  Mr. D’s hypertension and diabetes have been relatively well-controlled over the last decade. He has no known heart disease  stroke  or peripheral arterial disease.   Social History:  He is a retired mechanic and has a history of heavy smoking (30-pack years) but quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He lives with his wife  has two adult children  and is physically active.  Family History:  His father had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and passed away due to its rupture. His brother had coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at age 65.  Physical Exam:  His vital signs are stable. On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass is palpable. The rest of the physical exam findings are within normal limits.   Diagnostic Investigations and Results:  Considering his symptoms  family history  and physical exam findings  a computed tomography (CT) scan is ordered. The CT scan confirms an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.5 cm in diameter.   Treatment Plan:  Due to the size of the aneurysm and his father's aneurysmal rupture  Mr. D is referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.   Summary:  In consideration of his demographic profile  Mr. D has several risk factors for AAA  including age  male gender  African American ethnicity  smoking history  and family history. The early detection of his AAA creates an opportunity for successful surgical intervention  which may significantly improve his prognosis. His case underlines the importance of risk stratification  physical examination  and timely investigation in patients with risk factors for AAA. This strategy may facilitate early diagnosis and reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with AAA rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,19,"Case Presentation:  Patient Overview:  Mr. J  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department complaining of intense abdominal and back pain radiating to his lower back. He has a medical history consistent with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  but has quit smoking for the last 10 years. The patient's body mass index (BMI) lands him in the overweight category  at 27.   Demographics:  Historically  abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is most commonly found in Caucasian males over the age of 65 (Wanhainen  2019). Hence  Mr. J falls within the high-risk demographic. The patient currently lives with his wife in a suburban setting  retired from his occupation as a mechanic. He leads a somewhat sedentary lifestyle with a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Family History:  Mr. J's father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 73  thus indicating a strong family history. His elder brother (age 72) was diagnosed with an unruptured AAA two years ago  which further heightens Mr. J's risk of developing an AAA. Although his mother lived until 85 without cardiovascular complications  she had controlled hypertension and lived with type 2 diabetes.  Clinical Presentation:  Upon physical examination  Mr. J was found to have a palpable pulsating mass in the middle and upper part of his abdomen. He reported sudden severe pain in his abdominal area persisting for a few hours. There was no report of syncopal episodes  shortness of breath  or chest pain. However  he communicated a feeling of """"general unwellness"""".   Diagnostic Tests and Results:  According to The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS)  patients like Mr. J with a high suspicion of AAA should have immediate diagnostic imaging (Chaikof et al.  2018). An emergency abdominal ultrasound revealed an aortic aneurysm of 5.5cm. His electrocardiogram did not show any signs of myocardial infarction  and routine laboratory tests  including kidney function and complete blood cell count  came back normal except for elevated levels of D-dimer.  Conclusion: The diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm in Mr. J correlates with prior research indicating AAA diagnoses are more frequent in males with aging  history of smoking  hypertension  and strong family history of AAA. An emergency surgical consultation was made for the probable ruptured AAA  given the patient's severe pain and large aneurysm size. Meanwhile  he was stabilized with analgesia  intravenous fluids  and blood pressure management.  References: Chaikof EL  Dalman RL  Eskandari MK  et al.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,20,Patient Profile  Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  is a retired mechanical engineer living in Upstate New York. He is a non-smoker and moderate occasional drinker. He has been obese for most of his adult life  with a body mass index (BMI) of 33. He's previously been diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which are managed with medication. He is also compliant with his medication regime.   Family History and Current Health  Patient's father died in his early 70s due to complications from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His mother lived to her late 80s and had a history of hypertension and stroke. He is father to three children  all of whom are healthy.  The patient lives an active lifestyle and frequently partakes in morning walks. However  he has recently been complaining of a persistent  mild abdominal pain accompanied by back discomfort  noticeable after his morning walk  and subsides during the day while at rest. There have been no other new symptoms or significant changes in his health status.  Diagnosis and Treatment Plan  A CT Scan was conducted showing an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 5.5 cm. Due to the size and the patient's symptoms  surgical intervention is indicated. A meeting with the vascular surgery team is planned for reviewing the surgical options - open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair.  Management and Follow-up  The patient is on follow-up appointment schedules  and regular blood pressure checks have been strongly advised to manage systemic hypertension  which can influence the progression of the aneurysm. The patient understands the importance of vigilance regarding symptoms like sudden severe abdominal or back pain  altered state of consciousness  and feeling faint - which may indicate rupture and be life-threatening.  Conclusion  The patient's timescale to treatment and management is being expedited due to the presentation of symptoms and confirmed diagnosis. The nuclear family will need counseling  and risk determination screening may be recommended given the familial AAA incidental history. Lifestyle modifications such as weight management have also been advised to the patient as it can impact overall vascular health.   The medical team looks forward to monitoring this gentleman's progress  taking every measure to ensure his optimal recovery and long-term health.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,21,Patient Case Presentation  I. Patient Introduction Patient X is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in New York. He is retired and lives with his wife of 50 years. He has two children  both healthy and in their forties. The patient does not have a history of smoking  nor does he consume alcohol.   II. Education and Occupation Patient X is a retired engineer who had an active lifestyle prior to experiencing health issues. In the last decade  he had been dealing with hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he has been regularly taking prescribed medications.   III. Family and Social History  The patient’s father died of a heart attack at the age of 75 and his mother died at 90 due to old age. He has a younger sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago  but there are no known genetic diseases within the family.   IV. Medical History Patient X was diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 10 years ago. He was diagnosed by his primary care physician  and since then  he’s been on antihypertensive and statin therapy. He has shown adequate compliance with medication but has inconsistent control of his blood pressure. He has no known allergies to medications.   V. Presenting Complaint Patient X visited the emergency department with complaints of an abrupt onset of severe pain in the lower abdomen and lower-back that began earlier in the week. The pain was described as constant and sharp  rating it as 8 out of 10 in intensity.   VI. Examination and Investigation Findings Upon physical examination  a noticeable pulsatile abdominal mass was present which raised the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A subsequent CT scan confirmed an AAA  measuring approximately 5.5 cm in diameter.   VII. Assessment and Plan  Given the size of the aneurysm  Patient X was recommended for immediate surgical intervention. Currently  endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is being considered instead of traditional open surgery due to its minimally invasive nature and relatively lower risk.   In addition to surgery  Patient X’s current antihypertensive program will be reassessed to ensure optimal post-operative outcomes. A long-term plan including medical follow-up and lifestyle modifications including low salt  low cholesterol diet and an appropriate exercise regime will be considered.   VIII. Relevant Past Medical History  Patient X's hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are significant risk factors for AAA. The age  gender  and family history of cardiovascular disease make him more susceptible to the condition. Also  the large size of the aneurysm increases the risk of rupture  which is a life-threatening emergency.   Prepared by:  [Your Name] [Your Title or Position]   Date: [Presentation Date]
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,22,Patient Profile: Patient X is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  currently retired. His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia (both managed with medications)  and a 40-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He has no known allergies. His family history includes his father dying of a myocardial infarction at an age of 65.   Presenting Problem: Patient X first consulted due to a dull  persistent pain in the lower back and abdomen  symptoms that he noticed increasing in frequency over the previous few weeks. He also complained of feelings of fullness. He denied experiencing any episodes of chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  syncope  or early satiety. He admitted to an unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the past year  attributing it to reduced appetite and possible 'ageing'.   Clinical Findings and Diagnosis: Physical examination showed a moderately built man  with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the midline just above the umbilicus. No bruits were heard over this mass. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.   Given the clinical suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  an abdominal ultrasound was performed which confirmed a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. A CT angiogram was ordered to clearly delineate the extent of the aneurysm which also confirmed the diagnosis and further showed no evidence of rupture or leak.   Management Plan: Post-diagnosis  a consult with Vascular Surgery was sought which leaned towards an endovascular repair given the diameter and infra-renal location of the AAA. The patient underwent successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and stayed for 2 days post-procedure for monitoring. His post-procedure recovery was uneventful  and follow-ups were scheduled.   Noteworthy Details: About 75% of AAA occur in men  with the highest prevalence in Caucasian men over 65. The most significant risk factors for AAAs include age  male sex  a history of ever smoking  and a first-degree family history of AAA. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture.   This case emphasizes the importance of observing subtle symptoms and vigilant physical examination  leading to early diagnosis and management in high-risk populations  thereby potentially avoiding devastating complications. A multidisciplinary approach involving a vascular surgeon was beneficial in this case.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,23,Patient Identification:  Mr. Smith is a 72-year-old white male  retired military officer  presenting with complaints of persistent back and abdominal pain. He hails from Charleston  South Carolina and lives with his wife. His medical records indicate he is a chronic smoker for over 50 years and consumes alcohol occasionally. He does not have any known allergies.  Medical History:  The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he is taking medication. His chart shows he has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. In the past  he has undergone surgery for a hernia and has been treated for peptic ulcer disease.   Family History:  Mr. Smith's mother passed away in her late 60s due to stroke  and his father died in his early 70s from a myocardial infarction. His older brother underwent surgery for the same condition  abdominal aortic aneurysm when he was 68 years old.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith reports a 2-week history of unrelenting lower back pain and occasional stomach pain. He describes the pain as a deep  throbbing feeling that becomes more intense with movements. Although he experiences mild relief with over the counter painkillers  it doesn't totally disappear.   Physical Examination & Diagnostic Tests:  Upon examination  a palpable pulsating mass in the abdomen was felt. Abdominal ultrasonography and a CT scan confirmed an infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm. Laboratory tests reveal elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels.  Plan:  Given the family history  smoking habit  and the size of the aneurysm  surgical intervention is discussed for Mr. Smith. He is now under the medical supervision of a vascular specialist. Given his notable risk of rupture  an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure has been planned. His dietary habits and medication compliance are also being addressed.  Mr. Smith’s case underscores the importance of genetic predisposition  lifestyle choices  and adherence to treatment protocols in managing chronic vascular diseases like abdominal aortic aneurysm. It also highlights the necessity of periodic screening in high-risk individuals to prevent possible complications. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,24,Patient Presentation:  Demographics: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  referred for further checkup after a routine medical examination. He a retired engineer  lives with his wife  and has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. The patient drinks alcohol socially. His background shows a sedentary lifestyle since retirement.  Past Medical History: The patient’s medical history includes hypertension  which has been controlled by medication for the past 15 years. He has a history of high cholesterol levels and peripheral artery disease. He also had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus three years ago and maintains his blood glucose levels well with medication and diet.  Family History: The family history is significant with the patient's father having died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his mother passing away from stroke at the age of 75. His elder brother has peripheral artery disease  and a younger sister is living without any reported arterial or heart disease.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reported persistent abdominal pain and a sense of fullness. He had noticeably lost weight in the past few months.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in the mid-abdominal area. The patient showed no signs of distress or altered mental status; his extremities were warm & well perfused.  Investigations: An ultrasound and subsequent CT scan confirmed a 6cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Management Approach: Initially  conservative management was started. However  given the patient's rapid aneurysm growth  significant size and the associated risks  an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was recommended after discussing the surgery risks and benefits with the patient.  Discussion: The patient represents the classic case of AAA  considering his demographic (white older male)  personal (hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking) and family history (cardiovascular diseases). AAA prevalence increases with age and is more common among males  with a male to female ratio of 6:1. Smoking  hypertension  age over 60 years and history of heart disease in the family are common risk factors seen  with approximately 20% AAA cases been reported to be genetically linked.  Therefore  early detection through routine clinical examination and screening of at-risk individuals is crucial as the majority of AAA  if ruptured  could be fatal. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture  hence screenings and careful intervention planning as seen in this case presentation is highly vital. Overall  in relation to the risk factors  demographic details and family history this case presentation properly represents a typical case of abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,25,Patient Demographic Information  Patient Profile: Male  Caucasian  Age: 72  Presenting Problem: The patient complained of persistent abdominal pain and discomfort  with occasional back pain.  Past Medical History: History of Hypertension  High cholesterol  history of smoking  and Type II Diabetes.   Family History: Family history reveals there was a father and an uncle with cardiovascular ailments  specifically heart attacks in their 70s. Mother has a history of Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia.   Physical Findings and Symptoms: The patient has been experiencing persistent  cramp-like abdominal pain which tends to radiate to the back. He reports occasional waves of severe  sudden stomach pain that lasts for more than a few hours. The patient also complains of bloating. He also reported unintentional weight loss over the past few months and weakness. No signs of fever. Physical examination reveals a palpable  pulsating abdominal mass that is tender to touch.  Diagnostic Findings: Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a 5.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. No signs of rupture or leak were detected on the ultrasound.  Impression and Plan: The clinical findings in combination with the imaging results confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given the size of the AAA and the patient’s persisting symptoms  surgical repair was deemed necessary. As the patient has a significant risk for cardiovascular disease based on his medical and family history  he will be referred to a cardiologist for evaluation before surgery. Strict control of hypertension and diabetes is advised. Lifestyle modifications including cessation of tobacco use  dietary changes for cholesterol control and regulating blood sugar levels are advised.   Status Post Presentation: The patient is scheduled for an Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Prior to surgery  patient will also be on surveillance and medications to manage his hypertension  diabetes and hyperlipidemia.   Future Follow-up Plan: Post-operatively  he will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit. Discharge planning will involve teaching the patient about the signs of possible complications such as infection  aneurysm rupture  or graft problems. Follow-up appointments are set-up to monitor his recovery  wound healing and symptoms. Regular ultrasounds will be performed to track the stability of the aneurysm after repair. Long-term management of high cholesterol  hypertension  and type II diabetes is planned. Lifestyle modifications including tobacco cessation and diet changes will continue to be emphasized. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,26,Patient Overview:  Mr. X is a 72-year-old African American male who presented himself at the hospital with complaints of continuous abdominal pain radiating towards his lower back. The ache has been worsening over the past few hours  with no relief from over-the-counter pain medications.   Demographics:  Epidemiological studies indicate that certain demographic categories  like older male patients of African American heritage  are at an increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Given the patient's age  race  and sex  he falls within this high-risk demographic.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X is a retired construction worker with a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels for which he's been on medication for the past ten years. However  his compliance with taking the medication regularly has been questionable. He possesses a 50-pack smoking history and quit smoking five years ago. However  he reports no known allergic reactions to drugs.   Family History and other Risk Factors:  The patient's father passed away from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture during his late 70s. Given Mr. X's familial predisposition and smoking history  the danger of an aortic aneurysm rises significantly. Studies indicate strong associations between family history  longtime tobacco use  and the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Diagnosis:  Upon initial examination  a pulsating mass could be detected in the abdominal region. The subsequent Ultrasonography and CT scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  approximately 5.5 cm in diameter  which is a significant size  calling for immediate intervention.  Treatment Plan:  Considering age  overall health status  and size of the aneurysm  a surgical approach is recommended for Mr. X. As his vital signs are currently stable  endovascular repair (EVAR) may be considered. Additionally  lifestyle modifications have been recommended  in line with control of blood pressure  lipid profile  and maintaining a cardio-healthy diet. He has also been advised to refrain from heavy lifting and strenuous activities.  Prognosis & Discussion:  The prognosis of untreated large AAAs is generally poor due to the high risk of rupture. However  with successful intervention  most individuals can continue to live a normal life. The surgical repair  while not without risks  significantly improves the prognosis. Regular follow-up care including surveillance imaging is essential.  Teaching points:  1. High-risk demographics for AAA include older age  male sex  African American ethnicity  and family history. 2. Lifestyle factors (hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol) contribute to AAA's 3. AAA often presents as a pulsating abdominal mass with or without pain radiating to the back 4. The risk of rupture is substantial for aneurysms over 5cm  needing surgical repair. 5. Post-surgical patients require regular follow-up and imaging surveillance.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,27,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. J is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is a retired construction worker  married  with two grown children. He has a 45 pack-year smoking history but quit about 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially  and his BMI is 28  which categorizes him as overweight.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was treated with an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitor  amlodipine and a statin for these conditions respectively with average blood pressure within the normal range for the past year. He had his last cardiology check-up six months ago which did not pose any significant issues.  Symptoms Presentation: He came to the hospital complaining of a constant  severe pain in his abdomen and lower back  which started about three days ago. Mr. J also reports infrequent irregular heartbeat episodes over the past few months. There are no associated symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders  loss of consciousness  chest pain or shortness of breath.   Family History: His father died of an AAA rupture at the age of 72. In light of his family history and smoking history  Mr. J had been getting regular ultrasounds to monitor for an AAA and it was through this protocol  an expanding 5.4 cm infrarenal AAA was discovered two years ago. His mother had type 2 diabetes and died at the age of 78 due to myocardial infarction. His two siblings are alive and well; the older brother has hypertension  and a younger sister is healthy.  Physical Examination: The patient is afebrile. His vitals on presentation were BP 145/90 mm Hg  heart rate 75 bpm  respiratory rate 16/min and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the epigastrium.   Investigation: His complete blood count  urinalysis and kidney function tests were within normal limits. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.6 cm  which indicates moderate risk but considering his symptoms  it raises concern for imminent rupture.  Management Plan: Given his significant pain and the size increase of the aneurysm despite medical therapy  our team  after discussing with Mr. J  decided to proceed with open surgical repair. Risks and benefits were discussed with the patient  and he gave informed consent for the procedure.  Note: This case is a representation of the typical age group (65-75 year old)  gender (male)  ethnicity (Caucasian) and risk factors (smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history) associated with AAAs based on the literature. This demographic and risk factor profile corresponds with the general AAA patient population. The AAA growth rate has been estimated at 2-3mm/year. Larger AAAs (>5 cm) are associated with higher risk of rupture  especially if rapidly expanding or symptomatic.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,28,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe is a 70-year-old retired African American man  living independently with his wife in New Jersey. He was brought into the emergency department experiencing extreme back pain. Mr. Doe's BMI is 28 and he is a former smoker  having a 45 pack-year history. He quit smoking 15-years ago. He does not drink alcohol. According to the literature  it has been noted that African American men are at a higher risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm  with the incidence further increasing with age  high BMI and smoking history.  Past Medical History: The patient has a sedentary lifestyle and is often subjected to unhealthy eating habits. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. Hypertension significantly increases the risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Furthermore  he has type 2 diabetes controlled by Metformin for about 3 years and a history of moderate COPD diagnosed 7 years ago.  Family History: Mr. Doe's father passed away suddenly at the age of 55 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The presence of AAA in a first degree relative significantly increases the risk in patients  especially in males.  Presenting Condition: The patient presents with severe  sudden onset of pain at the back. Other complaints include dizziness  shortness of breath  and a rapid pulse. He denies chest pain  paleness  and clamminess. Differential diagnosis may include kidney stones  appendicitis  diverticulitis  or aortic dissection. However  his risk factors and symptoms led to the consideration of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Investigations: Imaging studies were immediately requested – an abdominal ultrasound and CT aortogram. Results confirmed a 5.4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management Planning: Clearly  the risk of rupture is high (AAA diameter >5.5 cm) and the patient's history highly suggesting the same. This patient will be referred to a cardiovascular surgeon for a possible surgical intervention. Lifestyle modifications are needed – reducing cardiovascular risks  managing his diabetes  COPD  and hypertension  and helping him to maintain a healthy diet.  Mr. Doe  his wife  and his children should be advised to get screened for AAA due to the strong family history. Further  cessation  or avoidance  of smoking should be emphasised as it is recognized as a significant risk factor for the development of AAA.   Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient will be closely monitored post-surgery with regular follow-ups  monitoring for potential complications and to ensure overall well-being and health status.  Mr. Doe's case emphasizes the importance of adequate screening measures  especially in high-risk populations  for timely diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  and can perhaps serve as a reminder for the same.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,29,Patient's Profile: The patient under discussion is Mr. Smith  a 76-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking and hypertension.  Presenting Information: Mr. Smith presented to the clinic complaining of sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen that started a couple of days ago. He also mentioned some mild-but-noticeable fatigue and slight dizziness over the past week.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been hypertensive for the past 20 years  which is managed by a combination of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. He is also a former heavy smoker  but he quit smoking around ten years ago after being diagnosed with mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). No history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  coronary artery disease  or aneurysms is recorded in his medical chart.  Family History: There is a remarkable history of aneurysms in Mr. Smith's family: both his father and grandfather succumbed to complications due to aortic aneurysms.   Physical Examination and Findings: On physical examination  Mr. Smith's blood pressure was found to be slightly elevated (148/92 mmHg). Abdominal palpation revealed a pulsating mass. Subsequent ultrasound examination confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 5.5 cm in diameter. No other abnormalities were noticed.  Lab Results  Diagnosis and Treatment Course: Bloodwork  including full blood count  kidney function tests  and electrolytes  was generally within normal parameters. EKG showed no abnormalities. The final diagnosis indicated an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Due to the size of the aneurysm  and Mr. Smith's family history  an open surgical repair was recommended to the patient and his family. He is currently awaiting surgery and is under strict monitoring for any changes in his condition.  Social History: Mr. Smith lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired engineer who leads a sedentary lifestyle. He quit smoking ten years ago. He doesn't consume alcohol or take illicit drugs. The couple has two adult children who live nearby.  Conclusion: Mr. Smith's presenting symptoms  physical examination  and subsequent ultrasound led to his diagnosis of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. His past medical history  family history of aneurysms  and lifestyle choices  such as smoking and having a sedentary lifestyle  have likely contributed to his current condition. Owing to the significant size of the aneurysm and his family history  an open surgical approach is recommended. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,30,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnston is a 71-year-old  Hispanic  retired mechanical engineer with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use. He was born in Texas and has lived there his entire life. He has no known drug allergies. He is currently living with his wife and is a father of three grown-up children. His mother passed away due to colorectal cancer and his father died of a stroke at the age of 78. He does not report any exercise or diet regimen.  Presenting Complaint:   Mr. Johnston presented to the clinic with complaints of a pulsatile abdominal mass that he noticed while taking a shower  coupled with a dull  constant abdominal pain for the past two weeks. He also mentioned that he occasionally feels a similar pain radiating to his lower back.  Physical Examination:  On examination  a pulsatile mass approximately 4 cm in size is palpable in the abdomen in the midline. His blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg  heart rate 85 bpm  and BMI 30.1. His chest and cardiac exams are unremarkable.   Investigation and Diagnosis:  Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.1 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A CT angiography further confirmed a saccular aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. Given his symptoms and the size of the aneurysm  he was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Management Plan:  Considering the size and symptoms of Mr. Johnston's aneurysm and taking into account his current overall health  the team decided to proceed with an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Preoperative cardiac assessment showed no significant cardiac diseases that would prevent him from having the surgery.  In addition to treating the AAA  he was advised to continue his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication  and a smoking cessation program was instituted. He was also encouraged to engage in a regular exercise routine and healthy diet to help control his other comorbidities.  Conclusion:   Mr. Johnston's case represents a common scenario in older male patients who smoke and have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are all strong risk factors for AAA. His demographic features and social determinants of health  such as his Hispanic background and resident of Texas  similarly fit the typical profile associated with increased risk of AAA as found in literature. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,31,Patient Profile:   Mr. James  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  is brought to the emergency department with complaints of severe  tearing abdominal and back pain of sudden onset. Accompanying symptoms include lightheadedness  fainting  and profuse sweating. He has no known food allergies; but is allergic to penicillin. Mr. James is a retired coal miner  married with three adult children  and lives with his wife in the rural community.   Past Medical History:  Mr. James has a history of smoking and heavy alcohol use (1-2 packs/day for around 40 years and 3-4 drinks per day). He reports hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications: Amlodipine 5mg and Atorvastatin 10mg respectively. He has no past diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases. In the past two years  he has complained intermittently about vague abdominal and back pain  assumed to be related to his previous hernia operation and advancing age  but never as severe as his current presentation.   Family History:  His mother died at the age of 75 due to a stroke and his father passed away at 68 from a sudden heart attack. One of his uncles had an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  suggesting possible genetic predisposition.  Physical Examination:  On examination  he appears distressed and diaphoretic. His temperature is slightly elevated  his blood pressure is 150/90 mm of Hg in his right arm and 145/85 mm of Hg in his left arm while his heart rate is tachycardic – 108 bpm. He has a pulsatile mass in his abdomen that is tender to palpation.   Investigations:  Subsequent CT scan revealed an AAA of 8 cm in diameter below the renal arteries with signs of rupture; Hemoglobin is slightly decreased  creatinine is elevated.  Diagnosis:  Given the history  abdominal and back pain  and confirmed by CT scan  the patient was diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  The commonly reported demographics of AAA  such as old age  male sex  Caucasian race  family history and smoking habit  as well as the clinical presentation and examinations were all concurrent with Mr. James’s case. This case highlights the importance of considering AAA in differential diagnosis for any elderly male presenting with severe abdominal or back pain  especially with a history of smoking and family history of AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,32,Patient Presentation: Mr. Jones is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents with consistent vague abdominal pain and occasional lower back pain for the past couple of weeks. He noticed an increase in the frequency and severity of pain during the last several days. The patient leads a sedentary life and has been smoking about 15-20 cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He admits to being moderately overweight. He denies any recent changes in bowel habits  weight loss  or any other sickness.   Medical History: Mr. Jones has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also has mild renal impairment  which has been stable over the past couple of years. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide  atorvastatin  and tiotropium inhaler. He has been on low-dose aspirin therapy since his diagnosis of hypertension.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 80 from complications related to COPD  and his mother died at the age of 82 from a stroke. He has two older brothers; one alive and healthy at the age of 74  and the other passed away from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 78.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a hard  pulsatile mass in his abdomen  and high blood pressure. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable  with no peripheral edema or signs of ischemia.  Clinical Investigations: In line with the patient's symptoms  family history  and examination findings  an ultrasound was performed  revealing an AAA of approximately 5.5 cm in diameter.  Treatment Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and risks associated  surgical intervention is pending. The patient is being evaluated for fitness for open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair. In the meantime  he is advised to quit smoking  maintain control of his hypertension and cholesterol  and monitor any increase in the severity of his abdominal pain  which could suggest an impending rupture.   Discussion: AAA is not uncommon in older adults  particularly in men over the age of 65 with a history of smoking and hypertension. Mr. Jones's family history of AAA and long-term smoking habit has increased his risk significantly. AAA often presents without symptoms until rupture  which carries a high mortality rate. Early detection and management play a crucial role in the patient's prognosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,33,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Female   Patient Information:   Mrs. A  a 73-year-old Caucasian female  presented with a recent history of abdominal pain and general malaise. She has been living alone since she was widowed ten years ago and has two grown children who live within an hour's drive. She retired from her job as a primary school teacher six years ago and since then has been leading an active lifestyle  engaging in activities such as gardening  attending book clubs and traveling.   Past Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication (lisinopril 20mg daily). She does not have diabetes and her cholesterol levels are within normal limits. She is a former smoker  having quit 30 years ago. She drinks alcohol sparingly  only on social occasions. She had no past surgical history and has not had any major illnesses in the past ten years except for minor ailments like colds and flu.   Family History:  According to the patient  her father died from a stroke in his 70s and her mother lived until her late 80s and died of natural causes. She has a brother who has a history of heart disease  and a sister who is healthy. She reported no family history of aneurysms.   Recent Illeness:  Over the past two weeks  she complained of a persistent abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness. She also experienced occasional feelings of light-headedness and discomfort in the back. She initially thought it might be due to indigestion and tried resolving it with over-the-counter medications  but the pain persisted.   Physical Examination:  Her vital signs on presentation were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the center of the abdomen. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Investigation & Diagnosis:  A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered which revealed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring about 5.7 cm in diameter.  Treatment and Follow-Up:  Considering her overall health and the size of the aneurysm  the patient was deemed suitable for a minimally invasive endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedure. She was counseled thoroughly about the risks and benefits of the procedure and consent was obtained.  Mrs A successfully underwent the EVAR procedure and her postoperative recovery was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with instructions to continue her antihypertensive medication and to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle. A follow-up appointment and a duplex ultrasound scan were scheduled for six weeks post-discharge to observe the status of the abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,34,Patient Presentation  Mr. Henry Thompson  a 68-year-old African American male  presented at the outpatient department of ABC hospital complaining of sudden and severe pain in his lower back and abdomen. He also reported having experienced episodes of feeling faint  along with unexpected weight loss in recent months. Mr. Thompson is a retired truck driver with a 35-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes each day  though he quit 5 years ago. He has been struggling with poorly controlled hypertension for 15 years  and has type 2 diabetes.   Mr. Thompson lives alone and has two adult children. His father suffered a heart attack in his early 60s  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70. According to literature  Black men aged 65–84  like Mr. Thompson  have the highest incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (Howard  Banerjee  Fairley  and Handa  2013). The patient's strong risk factors of age  genetic predispresentation  and smoking history further enhance his risk for an AAA (Buck et al.  2014).   On physical examination  a pulsating mass was felt in the abdomen  coupled with tenderness on palpation. The physician ordered an abdominal ultrasound  which confirmed the presence of an AAA. The aneurysm measured 5.5 cm in diameter  indicating a high risk for rupture.   Management and Follow-up   Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptoms  the doctor recommended immediate surgical intervention and the patient was urgently referred for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). In light of his hypertension and diabetes  our team will further help him manage these conditions post-repair to mitigate the risk of AAA recurrence and other serious cardiovascular problems (Chaikof et al.  2018).   Patient education about lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and a low-salt diet will also be emphasized to manage hypertension and prevent episode recurrence. Psychosocial support will be offered given the patient’s living situation and the potentially traumatic experience of an emergency medical condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,35,"Patient Presentation:  Patient details: Mr. George Hernandez  Hispanic male  65-years-old. Occupation: Retired construction worker  Chief complaint: Sudden onset severe abdominal pain  Past medical history: High blood pressure  high cholesterol  type 2 diabetes (all controlled with medication)  20-year history of smoking  quit 5 years ago.  Family history: Father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 73.  Present Status:   The patient presented to the emergency room with severe  unrelenting abdominal and lower back pain that began abruptly while he was doing his morning workout. He rates the pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale and describes it as """"tearing"""". He shows signs of restlessness due to the discomfort. The patient also reported feeling slightly dizzy but did not lose consciousness. No history of recent trauma  fever  or changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Physical examination:  Mr. Hernandez is in apparent distress due to pain. His vitals at admission were: BP 160/90 mmHg  Pulse 98 bpm  Temp 98.6°F  Resp rate 20/min  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On examination  he has a pulsatile abdominal mass and tenderness to palpation. No signs of external injury or hernias. Bowel sounds are present. Peripheral pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Radiological findings:  An emergency abdominal ultrasound followed by a CT scan confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.5 cm in diameter  indicative of imminent risk of rupture  given the rapidity of onset of symptoms.  Treatment and Management:  The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for emergency repair. His hypertension was managed with IV medications. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) surgery  a less invasive procedure  was suggested for the patient's AAA given its size and his severe pain. After surgery  his postoperative course was notable for transient renal insufficiency  likely secondary to contrast exposure  which resolved with appropriate fluid management.  Education and Counseling:  The patient was thoroughly educated about his condition and the inherent risks of surgery prior to obtaining consent. After recovery  he was counseled to continue managing his risk factors  including hypertension  high cholesterol  and diabetes  with medications and a healthy lifestyle. His family members have been suggested to undergo AAA screening  considering their family history.    Follow-up:  The patient is scheduled for a 1 month post-operative evaluation and subsequent regular follow-ups. He was also suggested to take up a cardiac rehabilitation program or physical therapy sessions for recovery.    Prognosis:  Older age  larger aneurysm size  and history of smoking contribute to poorer outcomes for AAA. However  the patient's aneurysm was promptly diagnosed and successfully repaired  which greatly improves his prognosis. He is anticipated to recover with regular follow-ups and diligent management of his pre-existing conditions."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,36,Patient Case Details:  Mr. Robert Jones  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the ER with complaints of intermittent severe abdominal pain that had escalated over the last 3-4 days. The pain was described as a constant and focused around the umbilical area radiating to his back. His body mass index is 27  suggesting that he is overweight. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  treated with amlodipine and atorvastatin respectively. There is no history of surgical interventions or allergies. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 25 years  with a history of alcohol consumption  but quit drinking 4 years ago.  According to Mr. Jones  his father had died at the age of 72 due to complications related to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Apart from this significant family history  Mr. Jones's mother is alive  free from cardiac diseases with only a history of diabetes type II. His sister was treated for breast cancer  but is otherwise healthy  and he has no children.  On his initial physical examination  a pulsating mass was felt in the abdomen. His blood pressure was 160/85 mmHg  heart rate 82 bpm  and body temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius. There was no tenderness or organomegaly. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count  liver function tests  and kidney function tests were within reference ranges. The lipid profile was slightly abnormal  with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.  Considering his symptoms  family history  and physical exam findings  an ultrasound of the abdomen was requested  revealing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 5.5 cm. A subsequent CT scan with contrast confirmed the diagnosis.  Treatment options were discussed with Mr. Jones  including observation  endovascular repair  and open aneurysm repair. Given his age and personal aggravating factors of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history  as well as his family history  a less invasive endovascular repair was considered the optimal course of action.  Patient was admitted and subsequently underwent successful endovascular repair of his AAA. He was discharged home on post-operative day four to follow up with Vascular Surgery in 14 days.  Clearly  Mr. Jones' case demonstrates the importance of considering AAA in patients with a family history  particularly with associated risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Successful management of this case was dependent on early recognition  appropriate diagnostic testing  and operative management. Efforts to control modifiable risk factors should be stressed upon in such patients to prevent recurrence or other vascular diseases in future. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,37,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith is a 75-year-old African American male  retired military personnel  who was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm during a routine physical check-up. Mr. Smith is a resident of Washington  DC  where he lives with his wife in their family home.  Demographics:  Mr. Smith falls into the age category at highest risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms  as over 80% of cases occur in individuals aged 65 or older. Additionally  African American men like Mr. Smith carry a significantly higher risk of developing this condition.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease  both of which are common comorbidities in cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additionally  he has been a smoker for over 40 years  which substantially increases his risk for vascular disease formation. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels  which have been controlled with medication for 5 years. He has had no surgeries in the past.  Family History:  His father died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 78  adding the element of genetic predisposition to Mr. Smith's risk factors. His older brother has also been diagnosed with a (non-ruptured) abdominal aortic aneurysm at 73. There is no history of Marfan's syndrome or any genetic disorders in the family that might increase susceptibility to aortic disease.  Presentation of aneurysm:  Mr. Smith's aneurysm is infrarenal with a diameter of 5.1 cm. At the moment  he is asymptomatic  but considering the size of the aneurysm and his risk factors (smoking and hypertension)  immediate intervention is necessary to prevent rupture.  Treatment Plan:  Given Mr. Smith’s age  medical history  the size of the aneurysm  and his risk factors  his surgical team recommends an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  which is less invasive and has a shorter recovery period than traditional surgery. Mr. Smith will need to continue managing his hypertension and hyperlipidemia and be counselled on smoking cessation to optimize his long-term health and minimize further risk of aneurysm growth or rupture.  Prognosis and Follow-Up:  With successful surgery and ongoing management of his medical conditions  Mr. Smith's prognosis is favorable. He will need regular follow-up appointments initially every 6 months to monitor his recovery and check for aneurysm growth. His primary care physician will also manage his high blood pressure  heart disease  and smoking cessation progress. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,38,Patient Profile: Ms. A is a 72-year-old Caucasian female patient  living in a suburban area of Boston  Massachusetts. She is retired and lives alone with no identified family support. She has been a smoker for fifty years but quit about five years ago.  Presenting Complaint: Complained of intermittent lower abdominal pain and lower back pain for around five months  which increased in severity over the last few days.  Past Medical History: Ms. A has a known medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has not had any surgical interventions before.  Family History: In terms of family history  her father had a history of peripheral artery disease and her mother died of a stroke. She has no siblings and her only child lives abroad.  Examinations and Diagnoses: On physical examination  she appeared pale and anxious but was hemodynamically stable. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass. An abdominal ultrasound showed an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management: The patient was referred for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) because of her age and presence of comorbidities. She was also initiated on beta-blockers to control her hypertension and reduce stress on the aneurysm.  Discussion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common condition  especially among older adults. Epidemiologic studies have shown higher prevalence among men  Caucasians  smokers  hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients. There is also a strong genetic component. The condition can be asymptomatic; however  symptoms such as abdominal  back or groin pain may be present. Urgent intervention is required as ruptured AAA carries a high mortality rate. Endovascular repair has proven to be a less invasive approach with lower peri-operative mortality rates in high-risk patients.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of considering AAA in elderly patients with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia that present with abdominal or back pain. Early detection can significantly reduce the risk of rupture and subsequent mortality.  Reference: U.S Department of Health and Human Services  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,42,Patient Presentation:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male presents to the hospital complaining of a pulsating feeling in his stomach coupled with lower back pain. The patient lives in a rural part of Idaho  U.S.  and is a retired farmer. He reports a history of smoking about a packet of cigarettes a day for 40 years  although he quit 10 years ago. There has been no previous history of any significant illnesses to date except for mild hypertension.  His body mass index is calculated at 24.9 kg/m2  and his vitals upon admission are as follows: blood pressure: 140/90mm Hg  pulse rate: 80 beats/min regular  respirations: 14 breaths/min regular and non-labored  temperature: 37.2°C  and SpO2: 98% in room air. Physical examination showed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen.  The patient's family history includes his father  who died at the age of 75 years due to heart disease  while his mother died at the age of 78  also from cardiovascular issues. He has a brother who's currently 72 years old with no known health problems.  Investigations:  An abdominal ultrasound was conducted  which revealed a 5.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. No other abnormalities were detected within the abdominal cavity.   Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is common in older adults  particularly in males over the age of 65. Risk factors include smoking  male gender  and a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients are usually asymptomatic and diagnosis often comes incidentally during examinations for other reasons or after complications have arisen. The case patient’s history of prolonged smoking  male gender  elderly age  and family history of cardiovascular issues increases his risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Management:  The patient was referred to vascular surgery for consultation and for managing the aneurysm. The patient was also advised to continue with his antihypertensive medications and given additional education regarding the signs and symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm such as intense back or abdominal pain  rapid pulse  nausea  excessive perspiration  and loss of consciousness.  Further  the patient was educated about the importance of regular follow-ups and routine screening given his demographics and family history.  Conclusion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition. This case emphasizes the importance of considering an abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosis in older  male patients who have a history of smoking. Regular follow-ups and screenings are vital for managing the condition before complications occur. Patient education about the disease is also important  particularly regarding symptoms of a potentially fatal rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,43,Patient Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  Age: 72 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian (Demographically  abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is more common in Caucasian males aged 65+)  Presenting Problem:   Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  was referred to the vascular surgery department after an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.5 cm  was incidentally discovered during a routine ultrasound. He complains of a continuous  deep pain in his lower back and abdomen which started a few days ago. He hasn’t experienced any symptoms of rupture  such as severe pain  shock  or loss of consciousness.   Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a 30-year-long history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both risk factors for the development of an AAA. He also has a 40 pack-year history of smoking. He has been on medication for controlling his hypertension and lipid levels  including a calcium channel blocker and a statin  respectively.   Other Significant Family History:  Mr. Smith's father had an AAA diagnosed at the age of 65 and his older brother  age 75  was confirmed with AAA two years ago. With such a strong familial history  Mr. Smith is also at a higher risk of developing an AAA.  Lifestyle:  As a retired engineer  his activity level is sedentary. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but revealing a heavy history of smoking. His dietary habits are comprised mainly of red meat  sugary drinks  and processed foods.  Physical Examination:  On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpably identified. His vital signs were stable  including blood pressure and pulse rate.  Laboratory and Diagnostic Results:  The abdominal ultrasound revealed an infrarenal AAA of 5.5 cm in diameter. A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the size and location of the AAA and demonstrated no signs of rupture or leakage.   Impression and Plan:  Due to the size of Mr. Smith’s aneurysm (greater than 5.5 cm)  his age  overall health status  and significant family history  strong consideration should be given to surgical repair to reduce the risk of rupture. The approach to surgery  whether open repair or endovascular stenting  would depend on further assessment of the patient’s anatomic suitability and overall medical condition.   Other recommendations would include lifestyle modifications  such as adopting a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  and regular monitoring of lipid levels and blood pressure. Genetic counseling and screening of first-degree relatives for AAA should also be considered  given the family history of disease.   A multidisciplinary approach involving a vascular surgeon  cardiologist  and an anesthesiologist should be utilized to effectively manage Mr. Smith's AAA. His case illustrates the importance of early detection and intervention in patients at risk  especially those with a family history of AAA and significant risk factors like hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a history of smoking.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,44,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Our patient is Mr. T  a 74-year-old African American male  who presented with back pain radiating to his flank and moderate dyspnea. He has a long-standing history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been managed well with Amlodipine and Atorvastatin  respectively. He denies a personal history of coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease  and he does not report any known family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysmal conditions. Mr. T is a retired industrial worker  never smoked  and lives with his wife in a suburban community.  Presentation: Upon physical examination  Mr. T appeared distressed and diaphoretic  with significant discomfort. His vital signs on presentation were: Blood pressure 160/100mmHg  heart rate 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and SpO2 of 95% on room air. On palpation  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected.  Investigation and Diagnosis: Given his uncontrolled hypertension  age  race  and the finding of an abdominal mass  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was immediately suspected. Further investigations were conducted  included a fast  focused ultrasound examination that showed an aortic diameter of 6.2 cm. A later computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm about 6.5.cm in diameter. No rupture was evident but the size of the aneurysm placed Mr. T in a critical condition requiring immediate medical attention.   Treatment Plan: Considering Mr. T's age  comorbidities  and the size of the aneurysm  he was deemed a candidate for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). This was discussed with him and his wife  and they both agreed to proceed.  Discussion: Abdominal aortic aneurysms pose a significant risk for rupture once they reach a diameter of 5.5 cm or greater  with risk increasing as diameter increases. This can be life-threatening  with 80% mortality when rupture occurs. Such aneurysms are more prevalent in males  the elderly  smokers  and those with a family history of the disease. A higher prevalence in African American and Hispanic populations has also been noted. With a high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm  endovascular or open surgical repair are the recommended treatment options.   In Mr. T's case  the AAA was detected early due to his presentation of symptomatic pain. His case should serve as a reminder to consider AAA in at-risk patients presenting with back or flank pain  especially if a pulsatile abdominal mass is detected on examination.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,45,Patient Presentation  Mr. A is a 70-year-old  Caucasian male presenting with pain in his lower back and abdomen for the last three months. His pain has been gradually intensifying and is non-radiating in nature. He also reports occasional constipation. There weren't any noticeable precipitating factors for the pain.  His medical history is significant for high blood pressure (12 years)  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (8 years)  and high cholesterol levels. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history. He has been compliant with his medications: Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. Mr. A denies any known allergies.  The patient's family history reveals that his father had a 'ruptured aneurysm ' causing a sudden death at 72. His mother lived to 80 with Hypertension (HTN) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). One of his two elder brothers has HTN and the other is healthy.  On physical examination  the patient was slightly overweight with a BMI of 27. A palpable  pulsatile mass was detected in his abdomen just above the navel. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/90 mmHg. There was no audible bruit on auscultation.  Lab results indicate slightly elevated glucose and lipid levels. A CT scan shows an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5cm in maximum diameter but no signs of rupture.   Considering Mr. A's significant risk factors (age  gender  smoking history  and family history)  symptoms  and examination findings  he was diagnosed with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The patient was counseled regarding the disease's gravity  and the need for intervention is discussed. His options are open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  with the final decision based on further assessment of his fitness and personal preference. He is also advised to stop smoking  maintain better glycemic and BP control  and regular follow-ups.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in the differential diagnosis in the elderly presenting with abdominal or back pain  particularly in the context of certain risk factors. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,46,"Patient Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. J.K  resides in Boston  Massachusetts. He is a retired carpenter  married with three adult children. He reports being a moderate smoker for 50 years; however  he quit 10 years ago.  Past Medical History He has a history of high blood pressure which was diagnosed 15 years ago and has been under control with medication. He also has been managing his hypercholesterolemia with statins since he was 65. Mr. J.K had an episode of myocardial infarction 7 years ago which was successfully managed conservatively. He is obese (BMI: 32) and continues to struggle with weight loss.  Family History The patient disclosed that his late father had a history of hypertension and died at the age of 75 from a stroke. Moreover  his maternal uncle underwent an operative procedure for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in his 60s.   Current Condition Mr. J.K presented to the emergency department due to a severe  sharp  persistent pain in his abdomen that radiated to his back  which started a couple of hours prior to admission. The pain is described as """"tearing"""". Physical examination revealed pulsating abdomen and a tender mass. He has lost his appetite but has no nausea or vomiting. No bowel or bladder dysfunction were noted. Review of systems revealed increasing fatigue but the patient denied any chest pain  shortness of breath or syncope.  Investigations The patient's blood pressure was found to be elevated at 160/90 mmHg. Lab tests showed slight renal impairment (Creatinine 1.5 mg/dl). Given his symptoms and family history  a computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was ordered. The CTA revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7 cm in diameter  confirming the diagnosis.  Plan The size and symptoms of the aneurysm warrant immediate surgical intervention. Vascular surgery was consulted and the patient was scheduled for open repair surgery. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit  in the interim  for close monitoring and blood pressure control.  Discussion As in our patient  most individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are asymptomatic until the aneurysm ruptures. AAA is more common in older adults  particularly men  and in those who are or have been smokers. Patients with high blood pressure and a family history of AAA are also at risk. Rapid diagnosis and management of AAA is critical to avoid rupture  which has a high mortality rate.  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and urgent management of a suspected AAA  the management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as well as the importance of considering AAA in older patients with abdominal or back pain."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,47,Patient Information: Mr. Thompson  a 70-year-old African American male  presented to the Emergency Room with sudden and severe lower back and abdominal pain.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson was previously diagnosed with long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has a 50-pack per year smoking history  which he stopped around five years ago. He also has a history of alcohol dependency  which he has abstained from for the past couple of years. The patient does not have any history of diabetes mellitus  but has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in his medical history due to his previous smoking habits.  Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at age 68 and his mother at 72 after a massive stroke. His elder brother had been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was successfully repaired.  Current Symptoms: Mr. Thompson described his pain as a tearing sensation in the lower abdomen and back area. He also reported feeling lightheaded and dizzy  with a sensation of his 'heart pounding in his chest'. The patient denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.  Physical Examination: Mr. Thompson appeared in considerable distress due to pain. Vital signs were significant for a blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg  heart rate was fast at 115 bpm  respirations were 22/min and labored  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the umbilical area  along with moderate lower abdominal tenderness. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Laboratory results were significant for elevated white cell count and an increase in serum creatinine level. Fast-track Ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A computed tomography (CT) scan further determined a rupture of an AAA into the retroperitoneal space.  Treatment Plan: On confirmation of the diagnosis  cardiothoracic surgery was immediately consulted for emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of the ruptured AAA.  Follow Up: Post operatively  Mr. Thompson was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring and was discharged after complete recovery. He was advised to attend regular follow up checks to monitor the graft and his blood pressure. He was also provided with resources for a healthier lifestyle  and nutritional counsel to manage his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Conclusion: Mr. Thompson’s case accentuates the severe life-threatening potential of AAA  especially in patients with risk factors such as age  ethnicity  smoking history  hypertension  and a family history of AAA. Early detection of an AAA is crucial for effective management and prevention of deadly complications  such as rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,48,Patient Profile: Initials: J.S. Gender: Male Age: 68 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Civil Servant  Residence: Lived in Boston  Massachusetts  Presenting Complaint: J.S. reports experiencing intermittent severe pain in his abdominal region  alongside unexplained weight loss and occasional back pain for the past two months.  Past Medical History: J.S. has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Also  the patient records a 45-year history of heavy smoking  although he quit five years ago. He has been on antihypertensive medication and statins for controlling his blood pressure and cholesterol levels  respectively.   Family History: J.S.’s father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm and underwent surgery in his 70s. He also has a younger brother undergoing treatment for coronary artery disease. Both his parents were suffered from hypertension.   Current Medications: 1. Lisinopril (for hypertension) 2. Atorvastatin (for hyperlipidemia)  Examination and Tests: Physical examination revealed a slight pulsating mass in the abdomen. Ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 5.4cm. Other lab results were within normal values except for slightly elevated cholesterol levels.  Treatment Plan Overview: The size of J.S.'s aneurysm qualifies for surgical intervention  considering his age and associated risk factors. An endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is recommended  whereby a stent-graft will be placed at the site of the aneurysm to prevent rupture. J.S. should continue with his currently prescribed medication to manage his hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with regular follow-ups to monitor his cholesterol levels  blood pressure  and the status of the aneurysm post-surgery.  Discussion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is more common among the male population aged over 65 years  with risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia contributing to its development. Family history is also a significant risk factor as seen in J.S.'s case. Regular monitoring and appropriate intervention can prevent rupture and subsequent complications.   REFERENCE: 1.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,49,Patient Information:   Mr. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of vague and intermittent abdominal pain  which he has been experiencing for the last 5 months. He also complained of unintentional weight loss and fatigue in the past few months. He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history.   Family and Social History:  He is married  retired  and lives with his spouse in a suburban environment. He reported that his father passed away due to a 'heart problem' at the age of 72  but he was unsure of the specific details. His mother died at 79 from complications of diabetes. He denies any illicit drug use but admits to consuming alcohol moderately.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile and tender mass in the midline of the abdomen. No bruits were detected. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.   Investigations:  Given his symptoms and the physical examination findings  an ultrasound of the abdomen was ordered  which revealed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. Subsequent CT angiography of the aorta confirmed the presence and size of the aneurysm. Other lab findings  including renal function and complete blood count  were within normal limits.  Diagnosis:  Considering the findings and his clinical presentation  the patient was diagnosed with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management and Follow Up:  The patient was educated about the disease and its possible complications. Given that the aneurysm is currently below the threshold size for surgical intervention (5.5 cm)  the patient was advised surveillance with ultrasound every six months. Optimization of cardiovascular risk with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was conducted. He was also advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption.   Given the family history of cardiovascular disease  family members were recommended to undergo screening for aortic aneurysms. The patient would be immediately referred for surgery if his aneurysm grows to 5.5 cm or larger  or if he develops symptoms indicative of rapid growth or impending rupture.  In accordance with the literature  it is known that Caucasian males over the age of 65  especially those with a smoking history like in this case  have a higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Hence the detection and management in this patient are in line with epidemiological findings.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,50,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-year-old Caucasian Male  Introduction: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who complained of abdominal pain. He described the pain as a constant  gnawing ache  which he had been experiencing for the past couple of months. He has a history of smoking for the past 30 years and heavy alcohol use.   Past Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and hypertension  both of which had been managed with medication (lipid-lowering agents and ACE inhibitors  respectively). He has no known allergies. Previous surgeries included a knee replacement 5 years ago.  Family History: A family history revealed an elder brother who had died at the age of 67 from an aortic aneurysm. The patient's father died of a heart attack at 72  and his mother is still alive at 91 with no significant medical conditions.  Present Complaint and Examination: The recent complaint was an acute exacerbation of this chronic abdominal pain  along with increased fatigue over the past few days. Physical examination showed a pulsatile mass in his abdomen. Further tests  including X-ray of the stomach and an ultrasound  led to the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Investigations: Blood tests showed normal renal function but elevated levels of cholesterol. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 5.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. No signs of rupture were reported.  Management Plan: Given the size and risk of rupture  an elective surgical repair was suggested. Due to his smoking history and hypertension  he remains at a substantially higher risk for perioperative cardiovascular complications  so he was referred to cardiology for perioperative risk evaluation and treatment. Smoking cessation was strongly advised.   Discussion: Our patient falls into a high-risk category for the development of an AAA due to his demographic (older  Caucasian male)  familial aortic aneurysm history  a history of smoking  and the presence of cardiovascular disease (hypertension and hyperlipidemia) - all well-established risk factors for AAA as per literature.   The patient's age and the size of the aneurysm present a risk of rupture if left untreated  hence the suggestion for surgical intervention. Although the potential for perioperative complications is high  studies showed that the risks associated with an untreated large abdominal aortic aneurysm far outweigh the operative risks.  Remember  the patient's well-being and consent are the most important factors when proceeding with the management plan for AAA. The patient should be fully informed about the potential benefits and risks of the procedure  and consideration of the patient's overall health status is important when deciding on the next steps. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,51,Patient Presentation  Patient Details:  Name: Mr. James Montgomery Age: 73 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Urban  Chief Complaint:  The patient came in reporting severe and persistent abdominal pain  which was consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Clinical History:  The patient has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has been treated for hypertension for 5 years. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago but made a good recovery. There is a known history of hyperlipidemia  angina  and early-onset type 2 diabetes. He has been following up regularly for his medical issues and is compliant with medication.  Due to a family history of cardiovascular disease (father died of a heart attack at 67) he has been proactive in maintaining a balanced diet and doing regular moderate intensity exercises  but his past smoking history and current hypertension are significant risk factors for AAA.  Physical Examination:  Vitals stable  BMI within the overweight range  and carotid arteries are soft with no bruits. Pulsatile mass is felt on abdominal examination. There is no sign of renal disease from the physical examination.  Tests and Diagnosis:  Suspecting AAA  an immediate ultrasound was ordered that showed a large aneurysm of the abdominal aorta  size4.5cm. A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the presence of AAA.  Patient Education and Management:  The patient was well informed about his diagnosis  the associated risks  and the options for management. Given his age and the size of the aneurysm  the risk of rupture was high. Following the discussion  the patient opted for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  which was successful. He is now under regular follow-up and monitoring.  This case represents a typical case of AAA - being more common in males and those of aged over 65. Significant risk factor observed include smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of cardiovascular disease and Caucasian race. The decision for surgical intervention and choice of EVAR over open repair were based on patient's specific risk profile and current guidelines.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,52,PATIENT CASE PRESENTATION:  Demographics: Patient Information: Mr. X is a 69-year-old African American man who lives in a suburban community with his wife.  Chief Complaint: Mr. X was brought to the emergency department due to sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen.  Present Illness: The patient has a history of progressive  intermittent lower back and abdominal pain over the past 6 months. He self-managed his symptoms with over-the-counter analgesics and rest due to his general aversion to hospitals and doctors based on previous experiences. However  the pain’s intensity had significantly increased during the last 24 hours  leading him to seek immediate medical assistance. He denies any trauma  recent activity strain  fever  or significant weight loss. He confirms episodes of nausea and mild constipation.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he manages with lisinopril and statins  respectively. He is obese with a BMI of 32. He is an ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago) but used to smoke heavily (around 30 cigarettes per day) for almost 30 years. He reports occasional alcohol consumption.  Family History: His father underwent surgery at 74 for an abdominal aortic aneurysm and died at age 79 due to heart failure. His mother died from complications of diabetes. He has one brother who is alive and well.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appeared in distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 100 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper part of the abdomen. His lower limbs were warm  and there was no loss of sensation or motor function. Bowel sounds were present.  Investigations: An urgent CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of a 7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. His full blood count  liver function tests  and renal function tests were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated white cell count.  Problems Identified: 1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm – likely causing the severe lower back and abdominal pain. 2. Hypertension - poorly controlled. 3. Hyperlipidemia - well managed. 4. Obesity. 5. Ex-smoker - potential contributor to cardiovascular disease risk and aneurysm progression.  Management Plan: Mr. X was urgently referred to vascular surgery and will likely require an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure. His hypertension and pain must be managed appropriately in the pre-operative period. Lifestyle modification  including weight loss  should be incorporated as an important part of the long-term management plan.  Patient Education: Emphasis will be placed on the importance of routine screening checks  regular exercise  healthy diet  weight loss  and strict blood pressure control. The patient will also be advised to schedule regular follow-ups to monitor the condition and adjust treatment  if needed.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,53,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 74-year-old Caucasian male  presented with a complaint of abdominal discomfort and lower back pain that has been persistent for two weeks.  Medical History:   Mr. Smith is a former smoker  having smoked one pack per day for 40 years before quitting 3 years ago. He is also a diagnosed hypertensive  currently taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and was recently diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. He has obesity  with a BMI of 35  and a sedentary lifestyle.  Demographics:  According to available literature  elderly males  particularly Caucasians aged 65-75  who have a history of smoking  are most at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).  Family History:   Mr. Smith's father had an AAA which ultimately led to his death due to aortic rupture at the age of 70. His older brother  who is now 77  had an elective AAA repair at 72 years old.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Owing to his familial predisposition and suggestive symptoms  Mr. Smith underwent an abdominal ultrasound  which confirmed a 5.2cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. This  taken in context with his age  sex  family history  and risk factor of smoking  was strongly suggestive of an AAA.  Management:  An interventional radiologist was consulted for an elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. In the interim  monitoring of the AAA was arranged every three months to keep track of potential growth. Mr. Smith was counseled regarding the importance of good control of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as well as encouraged to undertake a moderate exercise regimen for weight control.  This case highlights the importance of identifying patients most at risk for AAAs and implementing both preventive and monitoring measures to avert potentially fatal complications such as aortic rupture.   Mr. Smith's former history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle are general risk factors for cardiovascular diseases but are most significantly associated with AAA. Therefore the management plan should be aimed at improving his lifestyle and control of his chronic diseases  while simultaneously monitoring the size and growth of the aneurysm  to prevent future complications. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,54,Patient's Profile: The patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who has been recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He's had a history of hypertension for the past 20 years and is a current smoker with a 50 pack-year history. He had been following up regularly for his hypertension in the primary care clinic.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of other vascular-related problems like peripheral artery disease (PAD) and suffered from a minor stroke five years ago from which he recovered significantly. He has no known history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any collagen vascular diseases. He reported a history of chronic back pain for which he takes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) intermittently.  Presenting Symptom: Mr. Doe visited the emergency department (ED) with a new onset  intense  tearing abdominal pain that started suddenly few hours before. He complained of feeling a pulsating mass in his abdomen and occasional lightheadedness.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  specifically his father suffered a ruptured AAA at the age of 70 and his older brother  aged 72  has a known small AAA under surveillance.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination in the ED  Mr. Doe was found to be hypertensive (blood pressure 160/90)  tachycardic (pulse rate 110 bpm)  and had a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass.  Imaging and Diagnosis:  A bedside ultrasound confirmed the suspicious of AAA. It revealed an AAA with the maximal diameter of 6.5 cm. Due to his symptoms and signs  there was a concern for impending rupture  and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was promptly performed; this revealed an AAA with signs of early rupture  hence prompt surgical consultation was sought.  Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. Doe was taken up for urgent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) by the vascular team. He tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.  Postoperative Course: He was closely monitored in the ICU post-procedure  maintained on antihypertensive medication  and showed gradual recovery. His post-operative course was complicated by a slight increase in creatinine level indicating possible acute kidney injury  but this was managed conservatively and function improved by the time of discharge.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the need for a high level of vigilance in patients with a significant family and personal history of vascular disease. An accurate history and examination  timely investigation  and prompt surgical intervention saved the life of Mr. Doe. While smoking cessation  hypertension control  and regular follow-up are significant for him  it's equally important to screen his immediate family members due to the family history of AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,55,Patient Presentation - Case Study  Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  living in a semi-urban region in the US. He is retired from his job as a heavy equipment operator and is a veteran.  Chief Complaint: Patient reports experiencing severe abdominal and lower back pain intermittently for the past few weeks.   History of Present Illness:  The patient was managing well until six weeks ago when he encountered the first episode of pain. The severe pain intermittently presents itself and does not only confine to the abdominal area but radiates to the back as well. The pain lasts for several hours  standing moderate to high on the pain scale  and then disappears. No alleviating or aggravating factors were reported. The patient also complained of hard constipated stools  bloating  and occasional nausea but denied having fever  weight loss  or change in appetite.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years. The patient also had a myocardial infarction five years ago  after which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was diagnosed as a Type II diabetic three years ago and has been on regular medications since then. He also has a 40 pack-year history of smoking  having quit 5 years ago  post-CABG. He consumes alcohol occasionally.   Family History:   The patient's father died due to myocardial infarction in his early sixties. The patient's mother had hypertension and passed away in her seventies due to a stroke.  Review of Systems:   Aside from the pain  the patient has no report of other abnormal findings.  Physical Examination:   The patient appeared anxious and was moderately built. On examination  there was tenderness in the abdominal area. A pulsatile mass was palpable in the middle and upper abdomen region. There were no visible signs of external bleeding. The blood pressure was consistent with his hypertensive state and pulse was rhythmic but fast. Examination of other organ systems revealed no abnormality.   Based on the physical assessment and patient's medical history  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered. The ultrasound revealed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The AAA was approximately 5.5 cm in diameter. The patient was explained about the AAA and the high risk of rupture associated with the size of his aneurysm. Following appropriate investigations  he underwent successful open surgical repair for the same. Currently  he is on regular follow-ups and his vital signs have been under control.   This case underscores the link between past medical history  lifestyle choices like smoking  a family history of vascular diseases  and the onset of AAA. It also emphasizes the relevance of early diagnosis and management for preventing life-threatening complications related to AAA  like rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,56,Patient Presentation:  Mr. P  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to our hospital following a complaint of moderate and steady abdominal pain for the past week  coupled with a notable loss of appetite and an unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the last month. He reports that the pain is more distressing after eating and tends to worsen throughout the day.  Past Medical History: Mr. P had a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which were being managed with antihypertensives and statins  respectively. He quit smoking 10 years ago but had a 35 pack-year history prior to cessation. Lately  he’s been noting some shortness of breath upon exertion.  Family History: His father died of heart disease in his early 70s  and his mother lived into her 90s without any significant health concerns. His only sibling  a brother  had suffered a stroke in his 60s but had recovered with minimal deficits.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  a pulsating mass was found in the epigastric region. No other significant findings were noted.  Diagnostic Test: On suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm AAA.   Treatment: Upon the confirmation of the diagnosis  Mr. P was referred to vascular surgery  and an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was scheduled considering his age and the size of the aneurysm.  This case illustrates the importance of considering a diagnosis of AAA in elderly patients  particularly Caucasians  presenting with unexplained abdominal pain  a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. In such cases  abdominal palpation and timely imaging can be a lifesaver.    Epidemiology Information: Abdominal aortic aneurysm predominantly affects the elderly and is relatively more common in the Caucasian population. It is also significantly more common in men than in women. Smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia are major risk factors  and the disease may be asymptomatic until rupture  making screening and early detection critically important. Most small AAAs (3.0-5.4 cm in diameter) are monitored with ultrasound  while large AAAs (≥5.5 cm) typically warrant surgical repair.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,57,Patient Profile:  Mr. X  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented with discomfort in his abdomen and lower back persisting for several months. He had a 40 years’ history of smoking two packs per day  was a mild drinker  is a retired firefighter  and leads a sedentary life since retirement. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  which he manages with prescribed medications. His Body Mass Index (BMI) registers as overweight  at 27. He has no previous history of surgeries or allergies.  Family History:  Mr. X's father died at the age of 50 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His mother died of breast cancer at age 68. He has one brother who was diagnosed with AAA at age 65 and was successfully operated on.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. X complained of persistent tenderness around his navel  episodic back pain  and occasional bouts of constipation or diarrhea. He also mentioned discomfort while urinating. These conditions troubled him during other periods of his life  but these episodes started to become more frequent  prompting him to seek medical attention.  Diagnostic Findings:  On physical examination  he showed an abdominal mass that pulsed with his heartbeat. imaging tests (Ultrasound and CT scan) confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. An electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm  while blood tests showed slightly elevated white cell count (11 500 cells/µL) and an increased level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.  Treatment:  Based on the patient's clinical presentation and family history  considering the size of the aneurysm  the decision was made for surgical repair of the aneurysm. The patient was informed about the risk and benefits of the procedure  and he provided informed consent for the surgery.  Discussion and Conclusion:  AAA has a high rate of mortality if it ruptures. In Mr. X's case  his age  sex  smoking history  family history of AAA  and persistent hypertension are risk factors that contributed to his AAA diagnosis. No signs of AAA rupture were found in the investigations  but the aneurysm was large enough that it warranted surgical correction to prevent its rupture and avoid life-threatening consequences. It is equally important to manage his risk factors  such as helping him quit smoking  managing his blood pressure  and following a heart-healthy diet.  This case demonstrates the importance of family history and risk factor recognition in diagnosing and managing an AAA. It is crucial for health providers to engage in education and preventive strategies  particularly in high-risk patients  to ensure early detection and intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,58,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Caucasian Male  Patient Profile: The patient  Mr. X  is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  regularly controlled with medication. He is a retired engineer  residing in the northern United States. The patient is a former 40-pack-year smoker but quit smoking ten years ago upon the diagnosis of Stage I lung cancer. He reports occasional alcohol use and does not use recreational drugs. Mr. X lives with his spouse  and they have two adult daughters.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has had a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Stage I lung cancer. He has had his hypertension and hyperlipidemia controlled by medication  but underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his lung cancer. There was no indication of metastasis and he has been in remission for the last ten years.  Family History: Mr. X's paternal grandfather had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died at the age of 73 due to its rupture. His father had a history of ischemic heart disease. His mother is still alive and is known to have hypertension and diabetes. His sister underwent repair for AAA at the age of 70. None of his daughters have presented with any significant health issues to date.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. X presented to the hospital with a complaint of gradually increasing discomfort in his lower abdomen over the past couple of weeks. The pain was dull  non-radiating  and persistent but tolerable. There was no associated nausea  vomiting  fever  or change in bowel habits. He has no record of any recent trauma or injury.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. His vital signs were stable except for slightly elevated blood pressure. His cardiovascular  respiratory  and central nervous system examinations were all within normal limits.  Investigations: An abdominal ultrasound showed a 5.6 cm infrarenal AAA  with no signs of rupture. A complete blood count  renal function test  electrolytes  liver function tests  and coagulation profile were all within normal limits except for elevated cholesterol levels.  Diagnosis: Based on the medical history  family history  physical examination  and imaging studies  we confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment: Given the large size of the aneurysm and his increasing discomfort  surgical intervention was recommended for Mr. X. A vascular surgery team was consulted for the same. Given the patient’s cardiovascular risk factors  a cardiovascular risk assessment was done preoperatively. Post-surgery  long-term surveillance is planned to monitor aneurysm growth and development of new aneurysms.  While this case represents an individual patient  it correlates well with demographic data showing that AAA most often occurs in Caucasian males aged 65 or older with specific risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  and a family history.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,59,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male retiree living in a suburban setting. He has a history of heavy smoking with approximately 50 pack years and has a BMI of 28  indicating he is overweight. The patient is happily married and is a father to three adult children. He has a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in saturated fats.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with suboptimal control despite medication. He also has documented coronary artery disease with a history of myocardial infarction 10 years prior  treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient gave up drinking 15 years ago but still managed to smoke a few cigarettes daily. He has no history of any other significant medical or surgical conditions including diabetes  stroke or cancer.   Family History: There is a striking history of cardiovascular disease in his family. His father died at 72 due to myocardial infarction and mother at 78 due to stroke; one of the patient’s brothers has peripheral artery disease.  Presentation: The patient presented with intermittent lower back pain for the past one month. The pain was dull in nature and predominantly at the midline. Physical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the abdomen. No other significant findings were noted during the physical examination.  Investigation: CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. ECG report showed ST depressions in the inferior leads. Lab results reveal patient’s LDL cholesterol level is slightly elevated  indicating hyperlipidemia. Blood pressure was recorded to be 145/95 mmHg  suggesting an uncontrolled hypertension.   Plan: Considering his age  symptoms  size of the aneurysm  and existence of multiple risk factors for rupture (such as prolonged history of smoking and uncontrolled hypertension)  the patient was referred for an elective open surgical repair. The patient and family were educated about the potential risks and complications associated with both the disease and surgical intervention. The patient was also advised to quit smoking and was referred to a dietitian for advice on a healthier diet.  Follow Up: The patient is scheduled for routine postoperative reviews and monitoring of his cardiovascular risk factors. Long-term success will largely depend on lifestyle modifications.  *Note: This is a fictitious case meant to illustrate a presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It should not be used as medical advice or diagnostic material. Always refer to the input of a certified healthcare provider for medical guidance.*
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,60,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. Ahmed  a 65-year-old Middle-Eastern male  presented with lower abdominal and back pain persisting over several days. He has a history of hypertension (uncontrolled) and hyperlipidemia  conditions which haven't been monitored for the past year due to personal neglect. He has a 35-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction in his sixties  and his mother had a stroke in her seventies. Two elder brothers  aged 68 and 71  are alive with one having been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm three years back and another sister who suffered from a stroke at her early fifties.  Examination and Investigation:  On physical examination  a pulsating mass was palpable in the middle and upper part of the abdomen. No significant change in bowel or bladder habits was recorded. An ultrasound scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring approximately 5 centimeters in diameter. Subsequent computed tomography angiography affirmed the diagnosis and offered a more precise aneurysm size and location. His blood pressure at presentation was 170/100 mmHg  and he had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27.9  indicating overweight status.  Clinical Course:  Mr. Ahmed was hospitalized immediately due to the large size of an aneurysm and high risk of rupture. He underwent an open repair surgery where a graft was implanted to reinforce the weakened section of the aorta.   Post Surgery: His postoperative period was uneventful  and after a satisfactory convalescent period  Mr. Ahmed was discharged with prescribed antihypertensive (Amlodipine  5mg) and lipid-lowering medications (Statins)  and smoking cessation advice for sustained recovery. A follow-up appointment was scheduled one month postoperative  with subsequent regular checkups to monitor both his aneurysm and his hypertension.   Conclusion: For a good outcome in this case  it would be crucial to assure regular patient follow-up and appropriate medication use to control his cardiovascular risk factors. This will require a holistic approach involving physicians  nurses  and the active involvement of the patient to prevent rupture of the aneurysm and management of his overall health. Lifestyle modification advice focusing on maintaining a healthy diet and weight  along with consistent monitoring of his hypertension and cholesterol levels  is absolutely essential.   In the context of his family history  genetic counseling and screening for vascular diseases in family members are advisable. Aggressive management of risk factors in this patient will potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this severe condition. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,61,Patient Profile: Mr. Alfred Reynolds is a 74-year-old Caucasian male who resides in an urban area in Dallas  Texas. He is a retired banker  has been a smoker for over 50 years  and lives alone. He was married  but his wife passed away 10 years ago. Mr. Reynolds has two children who live out-of-state and don’t visit regularly because of their work commitments.  Past Medical History: Mr. Reynolds has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He had a myocardial infarction eight years ago and had bypass surgery six years ago for severe ischemic heart disease. He also has moderate chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease.  Presentation: Mr. Reynolds presented to the ER with a sudden  severe  and sharp lower back pain with a feeling of pulsation in the abdomen. The pain was radiating to his left thigh and was associated with nausea  vomiting  and feeling faint.   Family History: There is positive family history for abdominal aortic aneurysm in his father  who died suddenly at age 65 from aneurysm rupture. There is no relevant family history related to other cardiovascular diseases.   Physical Examination: On examination  he had an abdominal mass with a pulsing sensation and was experiencing hypotensive episodes. He showed signs of distress and his skin was palpably cold  pale  and moist.  Diagnostic Tests: Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 7cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Blood tests revealed elevated WBC count denoting possible ongoing infection or inflammation. Creatinine levels were also high showing impaired renal function.  Therapy and Plan: Mr. Reynolds was immediately admitted to the surgical ICU and a vascular surgeon was consulted. His blood pressure was stabilized with IV fluids. Given his age and high risk  an Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) was suggested in order to decrease the risk of rupture.  This case represents the common demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysms  as they are most common in older  Caucasian men  particularly those with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease. Family history is also a predisposing factor. The presentation of sudden  severe abdominal or back pain  often with radiation to the groin or thigh  reflects a large aneurysm at risk of rupture. Diagnosis is often made with ultrasound and prompt surgical consult is crucial in management.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,62,Patient Information   The patient is a 70-year-old African American male  named John Doe  who lives in the suburbs of Brooklyn  New York. He is a retired construction worker  is married  and has three grown children. He is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago  an occasional alcohol drinker and lives a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History  Mr. Doe has a past medical history notable for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and simvastatin. Previously strict about his medications  he states he’s been slack lately due to lack of routine caused by the pandemic. He has been non-compliant with taking his medicines regularly for the same reason. Additionally  he has been required to make significant dietary adjustments due to his type 2 diabetes. However  he admits to finding this change challenging to maintain.  Presenting History  The patient was brought to the hospital through ER  complaining of sudden onset abdominal pain that started a night ago. He reported that this pain was unlike any other pain he’d experienced before  describing it as intense  sharp  and radiating to his lower back. He also reported experiencing nausea.  Physical Examination  On examination  Mr. Doe's BP was 170/100  HR 95  and he was afebrile. There was tenderness in his abdomen upon deep palpitation in the midline and lower areas coupled with a pulsating mass. His BMI was found to be 31  indicative of obesity.  Clinical Impressions  Owing to the physical examination and the aforementioned medical history  the clinical impression was that of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An urgent CT scan was performed  which confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with impending rupture.   Family History  Mr. Doe's father died at the age of 62 from 'heart complications'  though the specific complication is not known to Mr. Doe. One older brother  age 73  is still alive and has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD). There is no family history of AAA.  Conclusion  Considering the demographic correlation  AAA is common in patients over 65  particularly men  and African American individuals have been found to be at a higher risk compared to other ethnicities. The risk is exacerbated by the history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  smoking  and a family history of vascular disease. Emergency treatment was initiated  and vascular surgery consulted for immediate corrective repair of the AAA. It's also suggested to begin a family screening process as the family history poses potential predictive implications.   References: Khosla  S.  Morris  D. R.  Moxon  J. V.  Walker  P. J.  Gasser  T.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,63,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Geriatric Patient: A Brief Case Study  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who was born and raised in the Midwestern United States. His marital status is widowed  and he has two grown children. The patient is a retired mechanical engineer and comfortably-Iiving on his pension. He identifies as a non-practicing Protestant and enjoys golfing and reading as hobbies.  Presenting Complaint: The patient came presenting with a two-week history of intermittent and non-specific abdominal pain along with some episodes of back discomfort. Symptoms are more pronounced after meals but are not associated with fever  vomiting  weight loss  any change in bowel habits  jaundice  or urinary symptoms.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been well-managed with medications for the past 10 years. The patient denies any history of diabetes or pulmonary diseases. He had undergone a cholecystectomy fifteen years ago due to gallstones.  Family History: The family history is significant as the patient's father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died of a rupture in his early 70s. The patient’s mother  currently 98 years old  is alive and lives with dementia. His elder brother succumbed to a heart attack three years back  while the younger sister is diagnosed with Brugada syndrome.  Social History: The patient was a regular smoker but quit 10 years ago around the same time he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He drinks alcohol moderately  typically indulging in a glass or two of wine per night with his meals. The patient lives alone and for his daily exercising walks about two miles to the local library and back.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected. The laboratory work-up was largely unremarkable. However  an Abdominal Ultrasound revealed an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm measuring 5.5 centimeters in the maximum diameter.  The case represents a stereotypical elderly  white male patient who mostly gets affected by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  as shown in many epidemiologic studies. His lifestyle  family history of vascular diseases  and smoking habit have put him at risk for development of AAA.  Management strategy: Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's advanced age  a consultation with a vascular surgeon was booked for further assessment. Given the elevated risk of rupture associated with aneurysms >5cm  the patient was recommended for elective repair.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,64,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. S  is a 67-year-old African American male from urban California  retired as an engineer. He presents to the emergency department with acute lower back pain and reoccurring abdominal discomfort over the past two weeks. He has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (lisinopril) and High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol within the normal range. His body mass index (BMI) is within the normal range.  Past Medical History: In regards to past medical history  the patient has been managing his hypertension for about ten years. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years ago but has been stable since then. Mr. S also has a history of smoking one pack per day for nearly 40 years but quit ten years ago. He doesn't have diabetes and his regular blood panels have been within normal limits.  Family History: The patient's father passed away due to heart disease at the age of 75  and his mother died of breast cancer at 80. He has a younger brother living with type 2 diabetes. His two adult children are both in good health.  Clinical Examination & Diagnosis: Clinical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. His blood pressure at presentation is 145/90 mmHg  and his pulse is regular at 85 beats per minute. Focused abdominal sonography in trauma (FAST) supported with CT scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of approximately 5.5 cm.  Management Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and his symptoms  surgical intervention was determined to be the most appropriate treatment. After discussing with the patient  he has given his consent for the procedure. It is planned to carry out the elective operation in the form of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Meanwhile  anti-hypertensive medication was increased to achieve better BP control.  Discussion: This case demonstrates typical AAA presentation in an older  male  former smoker with hypertension. Risk factors and demographics align with literature indicating higher prevalence of AAA in male patients  smokers or former smokers  those with a family history of cardiovascular disease  and in 65+ age group.  Being black  the patient falls into a group seen to have lower risk  yet his condition underscores the importance of considering AAA in any patient with appropriate risk factors and symptoms irrespective of race or ethnic origin. Hypertension control and smoking cessation has been shown to mitigate the progression of AAA. Monitoring of symptoms and elective surgical interventions upon reaching the threshold size can reduce the risk of rupture and associated high mortality.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,65,Case Presentation  Patient Demographics:  John Doe  an 82-year-old Caucasian male  presented with complaints of lower back pain that progressed over the past six weeks. He is a retired civil engineer  married  and has two adult children. He has had a long-term smoking habit  averaging one pack a day for the past 60 years. Mr. Doe led a relatively sedentary lifestyle with no current or past substance abuse. He abstains from alcohol and has no travel history. He gained 12 pounds over the past two years.    Medical History:  Mr. Doe’s past medical history includes controlled hypertension and peripheral artery disease (PAD). He has been treated for PAD for the last seven years. He also has a history of COPD  most likely due to his long-term smoking. He has no history of diabetes  no psychiatric diagnosis  and no previous surgeries.   Family History:  His paternal grandfather died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 75. His father was diagnosed with AAA at the age of 71 but passed away due to unrelated reasons. His mother is 81 and suffers from hypertension. Both his siblings  aged 75 and 77  are alive and well.   Symptoms:  Mr. Doe described his pain as a sharp  persistent ache in his back  concentrated near his navel. He reported feeling unusually fatigued  had decreased appetite but no weight loss. He denies any fever  correction  diarrhea  nausea  or vomiting. On physical examination  a pulsating mass was detected in his abdomen.   Diagnosis:  Being a male  smoker  over 65 years  and having a family history of AAA  Mr. Doe had a high-risk profile for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An ultrasound revealed an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.5 cm in diameter  thus confirming the diagnosis. An ECG was suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy but no other significant abnormalities. His blood work showed Hb 12.0gms  WBC 7800/cmm  platelets 2.5 lakhs/cmm with normal kidney and liver function tests.  Treatment Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptomatology  surgical intervention was immediately recommended. The patient and family opted for an endovascular approach (EVAR) due to its minimally invasive nature and quicker recovery. Mr. Doe was referred for the procedure next week. Concurrently  his smoking habit was addressed  and he was referred to a smoking cessation program. His hypertension was managed with control medication adjustments.  With ongoing surveillance  the multi-disciplinary team is hopeful Mr. Doe will recover without any complications. The family and patient were educated about the importance of lifestyle changes  the need for ongoing surveillance  and immediate medical attention in case of severe or sudden abdominal/back pain.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,66,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient is Mr. Ross  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  residing in New York. He is a widower living with his daughter and her family. He is a former smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption during his active years.  Initial Presentation: Mr. Ross presented to the ER complaining of severe  unrelenting lower back pain that radiated to his lower abdomen. He also reported loss of appetite and general malaise over a week.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ross has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease for which he is on regular medication. He quit smoking 10 years ago  but had a 40-pack-year history prior to quitting. A review of the system was found to be non-contributory.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Mr. Ross's father passed away at age 52 due to a myocardial infarction and his elder brother at age 65 due to a ruptured AAA.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  his vitals were: BP 150/90mmHg  HR 80bpm  RR 18breaths/min and temperature 37.1C. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass. No abnormal sounds were heard over the mass. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Lab investigations showed a slightly increased WBC count. All other parameters were within normal range. An emergency ultrasound revealed an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.6cm. Subsequent CT scan confirmed the AAA.     Diagnosis and management: Based on his symptoms  physical examination and radiologic evidence  a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was made. The patient was admitted and a vascular surgery consult was sought. Considering the size  symptoms  his history  and family history of AAA rupture - it was decided to plan for an urgent endovascular aortic repair.  This case demonstrates an instance of abdominal aortic aneurysm  an often silent but potentially life-threatening condition  especially in older male patients with a history of hypertension  smoking  and familial predisposition to aneurysms. The case also stresses the importance of physical examination and thorough investigation in establishing a precise diagnosis and appropriate intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,67,Patient Identification: Mr. X  68-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Issue: Complaining of intermittent and unexplained abdominal pain for the past month.  Past Medical History: Diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  controlled with medication. Former smoker  with a 40-pack-year history. No known allergies. Diagnosed with Hyperlipidemia  well-controlled.  Family History: Father passed away due to myocardial infarction at age 72. Mother had cerebrovascular accident at 79 and died at the age of 81. No siblings.  Social History: Retired military  married  lives with wife. No alcohol or illicit drug use. Used to smoke one pack per day but quit 12 years ago. Minimal physical activity.  Physical Examination: - General: Alert  no acute distress - Cardiovascular: Regular heart rate and rhythm  no murmurs  gallops or rubs. - Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. - Abdomen: Slight tenderness in the mid-abdominal region with a palpable pulsating mass  non-tender  firm.  Diagnostic Information: An ultrasound performed earlier today revealing abdominal aortic aneurysm with a size of 5.5cm.  Plan: Referral to Vascular Surgeon for consult on possibility of surgical intervention or endovascular repair considering his age  the size of the aneurysm  and overall health status. Continued monitoring and control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Patient is recommended to increase physical activity and maintain a heart-healthy diet to prevent progression of atherosclerosis.  In this hypothetical case  Mr. X's overall health status  coupled with his strong family history of cardiovascular disease  consistent hypertension  previous smoking habit  and hyperlipidemia without an adequate lifestyle modification predispose him to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The brief presentational information provides enough data in order to assess and make a medical decision on the best course of action for the patient in collaboration with specialized departments. The prevalence rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm in males above 65 years of age is highest among Caucasians.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,68,Patient Presentation:  Patient Initials: R.S.  Sex: Male  Age: 62 years old  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer   Presenting Issue:   R.S. presented to the hospital with acute lower back pain and an episode of syncope. He reported feeling a pulsation in his abdomen  together with occasional back pain for the past several months  but thought it was indigestion or muscle strain.   Past Medical History:  R.S. had been diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago  for which he is currently taking Lisinopril. He has been a chronic smoker for over 40 years  averaging at around 20 cigarettes a day. He has a history of high cholesterol but non-compliant with statin medications.  Family History:  Father died at the age of 68 from myocardial infarction. Mother is 88 years old  with type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. His younger brother also has a history of hypertension  and his elder sister has rheumatoid arthritis. There is no known hereditary genetic disorder in the family.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile  palpable mass in the patient's mid-abdominal region. He exhibited signs of hypovolemic shock  including tachycardia and pallor. However  the patient was responsive and oriented.  Diagnostic Findings:  Ultrasound imaging confirmed abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring approximately 5.3 cm. Unenhanced CT scan depicted a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no signs of rupture.  Plan:  Due to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's advanced age  surgical intervention was deemed essential to reduce the risk of rupture. Elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been planned. The patient was counselled extensively about lifestyle modifications  specifically smoking cessation. The importance of being compliant with medication to manage hypertension and cholesterol levels was emphasized.   Final Comments:  R.S. presents a typical case of abdominal aortic aneurysm in line with the literature  with his pronounced risk factors being his sex  age  smoking history and hypertension. Following treatment  he will require regular check-ups to monitor the success of the procedure  his blood pressure  and any appearance/signs of further aneurysm development. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,69,Patient Information:  Mr. Smith  a 67-year-old male of non-Hispanic white descent  residing in Sacramento  California. He is married with 3 adult children and retired. Overall  he has a relatively sedentary lifestyle since retiring from his construction job.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a long history of hypertensive disease  controlled on medications (Lisinopril 20mg). He has also been diagnosed with dyslipidemia and mild obesity with a BMI of 30.3. He underwent a successful total knee replacement six years ago and has an allergy to Cefuroxime. Mr. Smith has been a 25-pack-year smoker but quit smoking approximately 10 years ago. He reports moderate alcohol use. Regular follow-ups with his internist are documented.  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Smith presented to the Emergency Department with acute  severe lower back and abdominal pain  which began early in the morning. The pain did not radiate and was not associated with food intake  bowel movements  or urination. There was no record of fever  loss of consciousness  chest pain  or dyspnea.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's father passed away due to a 'heart condition' in his 70s. His mother lived up to 82 and died of cancer-related complications. He has one older brother with coronary artery disease and a younger sister with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. No known history of any vascular diseases in the immediate family.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic Findings:  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. A tentative diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was made. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed a 7cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no evidence of leak or rupture.  Plan of Action:  Currently  Mr. Smith has been admitted under the vascular team for further management. Owing to the large size of the aneurysm  a consultation with the vascular surgeon has been planned to evaluate him for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). His family has been informed about his condition and the risks associated with the surgical procedure.  Conclusion:  This case study exemplifies the significance of thorough physical examinations and the need for timely intervention in managing potential life-threatening conditions such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,70,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the outpatient department with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past two months. He expressed a sense of discomfort  describing the pain as a deep  throbbing sensation  located on and off around his navel area. He had no history of nausea  vomiting  or change in bowel habits.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is a known case of hypertension for the last 10 years and has been on medication (metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide). He also has a history of heavy cigarette smoking for about 35 years  having quit about 5 years ago. His other past medical history includes high cholesterol levels treated with statin. No known allergies are present.   Family History:  His family history is significant  with his father having died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at age 75  and his older brother was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at 70.  Clinical Examination & Investigations:  On physical examination  he was comfortably placed with a BMI of 29 (height 175 cm  weight 88 kg). Pulse rate was 78/min  blood pressure was noted to be 140/80 mmHg. On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass was felt just above the navel. His cardiovascular system revealed no abnormalities  and there is no evidence of peripheral vascular disease in the lower extremities. Basic investigations  including complete blood count  kidney function test  lipid profile  and liver function test  were within normal limits.  Abdominal ultrasound showed an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 5.5 cm. Chest x-ray and EKG were generally unremarkable.  This presentation is typical for an asymptomatic AAA  with the risk factors being age > 65 years  male gender  Caucasian race  smoking history  and family history.  Treatment & Management:  A discussion was held with Mr. Doe about his diagnosis and the surgical repair of AAA  considering his aneurysm size and familial history. A detailed record of his case was made and planned for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  after obtaining written informed consent. He was advised to follow a low-fat diet  and his antihypertensive medications were revised. Smoking cessation (although he already quit) and regular exercise were emphasized. His close relatives were advised about screening for AAA due to family history.  Follow-up:  Mr. Doe will be followed up in the clinic to monitor his status  watch for complications  and ensure proper post-operative care.  In conclusion  this case illustrates the importance of recognising risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm and the role of family history. The clinical management for AAA includes considerations about surgical treatments based on factors such as the patient's age  gender  history of smoking etc. Patients who fit these demographics  such as Mr. Doe  should report any sudden onset of abdominal or lower back pain to healthcare providers promptly.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,71,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Manuel Alvarez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  was admitted to the hospital complaining of severe  constant pain in his lower abdomen and back which began in the last 12 hours. He reports that the pain is not influenced by food intake or physical activity. His primary language is Spanish  which adds a possible language barrier to obtaining a complete medical history and ensuring informed patient decisions.  Past Medical History: Mr. Alvarez has been diagnosed with hypertension (managed with lisinopril)  hyperlipidemia (managed with atorvastatin) and had 15-year history of heavy smoking (20 cigarettes/day) but quit 5 years ago. He has been otherwise healthy and has no known drug allergies.  Demographics: Mr. Alvarez is retired  widowed and lives alone in a flat. He relocated from Mexico to Texas 10 years ago. His diet is primarily traditional Mexican cuisine  which is heavy in sodium and fats. He remains relatively sedentary  except for routine visits to a local senior center.  Family History: His father and older brother both died suddenly in their early 60s from heart disease. His mother reportedly died from a """"ruptured artery"""" in her abdomen  although the patient lacks a full understanding of the specifics due to the language barrier.  Physical Examination: Mr. Alvarez appeared to be in extreme pain  exacerbated when touched in the left-lower quadrant of the abdomen. The auscultation of heart sounds showed no irregularities  but a bruit was heard over his abdominal area. His blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 beats/min  respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min  and the body temperature was at 98.6 °F.  Laboratory Tests / Imaging: Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a possible aneurysm. A follow-up CT scan confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a 6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Lab tests found his cholesterol and triglyceride levels elevated  consistent with hyperlipidemia. His complete blood count  kidney function tests  and liver function tests were within normal limits.   Impression and Plan: A diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was made based on the patient's symptoms  physical examination  and confirmatory imaging tests. Given the size of the aneurysm  the patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery for emergency repair as the pain could indicate a pending rupture. The patient was also referred to a Spanish-speaking case manager to ensure accurate communication and understanding of the medical condition and the surgical procedure. His hypertension and hyperlipidemic treatment plans will require adjustments with new guidelines for patients with AAA. The patient was also advised to inform his children about the AAA diagnosis due to the possible genetic component of the disease. After surgery  Mr. Alvarez will be closely followed up in the outpatient setting."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,72,Patient Presentation  Mr. Albert Johnson  a 70-year-old African American male  presented at the emergency department complaining of persistent and severe abdominal and back pain for the past few days. Mr. Johnson says the pain is not episodic  and it seems to radiate to his back and lower limbs. He reported a loss of appetite but denied any bowel or bladder changes or weight loss.   Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson is a retired factory worker with significant occupational exposure to lead. He has a history of hypertension  which is controlled by regular medications  and a 40-pack-year smoking history before quitting 5 years ago  along with occasional alcohol use. There’s no history of any surgeries. He has a long history of neglecting routine health check-ups and recent weight gain of about 10 lbs. He occasionally takes over-the-counter antacid for heartburn.  Family History  Mr. Johnson’s father died in his sixties of a stroke. His mother  who is in her nineties  suffers from age-related macular degeneration. His younger brother  aged 66  was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has one son and one daughter  both believe to be healthy. There’s no history of lung or kidney disease in the family.  Clinical Examination  On examination  Mr. Johnson has a pulsatile abdominal mass  and his Body Mass Index (BMI) 28 falls in the overweight category. His Blood pressure was elevated in the clinic with a reading of 155/95 mmHg.  Investigations  Ultrasound and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) were performed  following clinical examination  confirming the presence of a large infra-renal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) of around 6.5cm  which requires intervention.  Discussion  Risk factors for AAA include age over 65  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  family history of AAA  and Caucasian race. Interestingly  African Americans have a lower prevalence of AAA compared to Whites. But in our case  Mr. Johnson has major risk factors like advanced age  male gender  smoking history  and hypertension  including a family history of AAA  and hence confirms AAA diagnosis even being an African American male.   The patient's hypertension  history of smoking  occupational exposure to toxins  and poor health maintenance could have led to his current condition. Weight gain and associated heartburn might indicate lifestyle-related issues. It is important to consider his age and neglect of routine health check-ups in managing his condition moving forward.  This case presentation highlights the need for AAA screening in individuals with risk factors  regardless of race or ethnic background  to prevent fatal outcomes.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,73,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J.T  retired accountant who resides in Northern California. He has lived in the region for the last four decades. He is a smoker with a history of smoking 1 pack per day for the last 50 years. The patient is married and has three grown-up daughters  but there's no history of cardiovascular disease in the family. The patient weighs around 90kg and is 175 cm tall  so his BMI is classified as overweight.  Presenting Concern: Mr. J.T. presents with midepigastric and lower back pain marked as a pulling sensation  unrelieved by rest or lying position for the past 2 weeks. No bowel or bladder dysfunction reported.  Past Medical History: Mr. J.T. has a past medical history exceptional for essential hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His hypertension is controlled with Lisinopril and his hyperlipidemia with Simvastatin. He had been prescribed some medication for COPD but is noncompliant due to some financial issues.  Physical Exam: Upon examination  he appears weaker but is in no acute distress. His BP is 160/90 mmHg  heart rate regular. His abdomen is tender at the periumbilical region with a pulsatile mass.  Diagnostic Tests: A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered  which showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.4 cm in diameter. Other structures appeared normal.  Discussion: The patient Tobacco consumption  uncontrolled hypertension and COPD  along with his age puts him at increased risk for the development and rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His description of unremitting abdominal pain and back pain  along with the finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass on physical exam  raised suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management Plan: Urgent surgical evaluation is warranted for Mr. J.T. given the size of his aneurysm and his presenting symptoms  suggestive of impending rupture. Meanwhile  strict control of his blood pressure is necessary to prevent further enlargement of the abdominal aneurysm.  Conclusion:  This case exemplifies proper identification and prompt management of abdominal aortic aneurysm  a potentially life-threatening condition if left unnoticed. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are key elements in the successful of this patient's treatment. It's also important that Mr. J.T. quit smoking and maintain his overall health to help mitigate further health risks.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,74,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old African American male  has been having intermittent  dull abdominal pain for a couple of weeks. He is a retired military sergeant and currently lives alone in his house.  Demographics: Mr. Johnson embodies a typical case witnessed in healthcare literature: he falls within the highest-risk demographic group for the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms—male  over 65  and African American.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that he controls with medication. He was a smoker but quit approximately 10 years ago after four decades of substantial pack/year history. He does not consume alcohol due to a past diagnosis of mild liver cirrhosis. Apart from these pathologies  Mr. Johnson has led a relatively healthy life with no other significant co-morbidities.  Family History:  He reports a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died at the age of 74 due to myocardial infarction  and his elder brother has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. There is no family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  As part of his annual health check-up  Mr. Johnson underwent an elective ultrasound which revealed a 5-cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Given the size of the aneurysm and his relative good health otherwise  his vascular surgeon advised him to consider an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  following pre-operative health optimization and risk stratification.  Behavioural and lifestyle modifications were also discussed with Mr. Johnson  including a healthy diet to manage his blood lipid levels and hypertension and regular exercise within limits of his physical comfort and abilities. He was also referred to a cardiac rehabilitation team for facilitating necessary lifestyle changes and continued cessation of smoking.  This case highlights the importance of routine health screening  especially in high-risk demographic groups. Early identification can lead to timely interventions  helping to alter disease progression or improve outcomes  particularly in potentially life-threating pathologies like an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,75,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 66 Race: Caucasian Gender: Sex Residential Status: Urban Occupation: Retired Mechanical Engineer Past Medical History: Hypertension  High cholesterol levels Family History: Father died due to heart attack  Mother with high blood pressure   Presentation: Mr. John Doe  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  presented to our emergency department complaining of sudden severe abdominal pain radiating to his lower back. The patient was previously diagnosed and treated for hypertension and high cholesterol. His adherence to medications and routine check-ups has been consistent. His smoking habits (one pack a day for the past 35 years) can be identified as a significant risk factor leading to his present condition.   Family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70  while his mother suffers from hypertension. As per literature  male gender  age over 60  smoking history  high blood pressure  and family history of the disease are key risk factors of abdominal aortic aneurysm which justifies the potential risk in this case.   On examination  his vital signs were within normal limits  but a pulsatile mass was palpable in the mid-abdominal area. The pain scale recorded an 8 out of 10 describing the pain as 'tearing'. A discussion about his medical history and recent symptoms indicated a possible Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).  An urgent ultrasound confirmed an AAA approximately 5.5cm in size. Due to its size and his symptomatology  the decision was made to operate. Pathology reports later confirmed the AAA.  Post-recovery  Mr. Doe was counseled to quit smoking and was enrolled in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program. He was also educated about the nature of AAA and the need for regular monitoring to prevent future occurrences. This case emphasizes the need for AAA screening programs  especially in risk groups i.e.  males over 60 years with a family history of AAA and a smoking history.  (Note: The demographic details for AAA  such as gender  age  race  and the risk increased due to personal and family medical history  are consistent with typical AAA patient profiles as found in research literature.)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,76,Patient Presentation  Patient Identification: Mr. Ahmad Zubair  Male  68 years old  of Middle-Eastern descent  married  retired engineer.  Main Complaint: Presented to the emergency department with severe  constant  and overwhelming lower back and abdominal pain for two days.  Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with Hypertension for the past 12 years  managed by medication. He is also a former smoker  having quit 6 years ago but had a significant pack-year history prior. There is no history of any known drug allergies. He has had no prior surgeries.  Family History: Patient's father died in his early-70s because of stroke. His mother suffered from hypertension and diabetes but died from pneumonia at the age of 80. His older brother  currently 72  has been diagnosed with Ischemic Heart Disease. The patient has 2 sons  both healthy.  Clinical Examination and Investigations: Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 7cm. Lab results showed a slightly elevated white blood cell count but other parameters within normal limits.  Clinical Impression: Large abdominal aortic aneurysm in a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension.  Management Plan: Given the size of the AAA and symptomology  surgical intervention was unavoidable. The patient was informed about the risks of rupture and subsequent complications. The option of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was discussed  as was open repair. After providing informed consent  the patient elected to proceed with EVAR.  Post-Op Follow Up: Post-operative recovery was uneventful and symptoms relieved. He was discharged with a plan for regular follow-ups and imaging to monitor the site of the repair.  Discussion: This case underlines the importance of regular screening  particularly in patients over the age of 60 with a history of hypertension  smoking  or a family history of AAA. Mr. Ahmad had no notion of having AAA  despite being in a high-risk group  until the symptoms became severe. Earlier detection might have resulted in less invasive management options.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,77,Patient Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Demographics: The patient is an 83-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He is a retired civil engineer  is married with no children. He lives in suburban New York with his wife. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Presenting Issue:  Mr. Smith presents with a sudden  severe and constant abdominal pain that has persisted for several hours. He rates his pain as an '8' on a 1-10 scale. He also complains of dizziness  nausea and back pain.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic kidney disease  for which he is receiving regular treatment. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and a bypass surgery following this. He is not diabetic. He has no known allergies.  Family History:  His father had a heart condition and died of an unknown cause in his late 70s. His mother lived into her 90s with no significant health issues. He has one younger brother in good health  and one older sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early 60s.  Examination and Diagnosis: On physical examination  Mr. Smith appeared to be in severe pain with a distended abdomen. His heart rate was elevated at 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 140/90 and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsating mass in the midline.   A subsequent ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) approximately 7.5 cm in diameter. Judging by the size and symptom severity  immediate intervention was deemed necessary due to the high risk of rupture.  Summary: Considering Mr. Smith’s sudden severe abdominal pain  his risk factors of advanced age  male sex  and cardiovascular disease history  as well as the discovery of a large and symptomatic AAA  immediate medical intervention is highly warranted. He was counseled regarding the need for urgent surgery and referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.  This case displays the critical importance for healthcare providers to consider an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the differential diagnosis generally but specifically for elderly male patients presenting with sudden  severe and persistent abdominal or back pain.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,78,Subject: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. M  who resides in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired engineer  weighing 82kg (BMI: 28.5)  and stands at 5’9” (175cm). He is married with three adult children and six grandchildren. He is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but admits to consuming alcohol occasionally. His social history is notable for jogs twice a week. He has a history of hypertension  which has been managed with a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide for the past ten years. Mr. M has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. M presented with incessant lower abdominal pain  accompanied by discomfort radiating to his back. The pain  which he describes as 7/10  has been constant over the last 24 hours. He denied any associated symptoms such as palpitations  shortness of breath  nausea  or vomiting.   Family History: His father died at the age of 72 of a myocardial infarction. His mother is currently 88 years old and has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He also has one brother who is living and healthy but a late sister who died following complications during childbirth.  Clinical Examination Findings: Upon palpation  an abdominal mass was detected  consistent with AAA. Mr. M's blood pressure was measured at 140/85 mmHg  and his pulse rate was 82 bpm. Other vitals including respiratory rate and body temperature were within normal ranges. His cardiovascular examination was unremarkable barring a slight bruit over the palpated abdominal mass.  Investigations: A subsequent ultrasound confirmed AAA with a maximal diameter of 5.8cm. Laboratory data  including complete blood counts  renal function  and electrolytes  were mostly within normal limits apart added mild anemia (Hb: 11.2 g/dL). An ECG displayed normal sinus rhythm.  Management: Mr. M was hospitalized immediately considering the risk of AAA rupture. He will be scheduled for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  which is the preferred method in patients with suitable anatomy and multiple comorbidities. He is also started on blood pressure control and treatment for his anemia.  This case demonstrates a common condition affecting individuals over the age of 60  particularly males  with past smoking history and hypertension as key risk factors. Prompt recognition through physical examination and definitive management via invasive intervention is vital to prevent fatal rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,79,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  a lifetime non-smoker who presents with intermittent  dull abdominal pain for the past few weeks. He reports no changes in bowel habits  anorexia  or weight loss. He drinks alcohol moderately.   Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  diagnosed at age 50 and is well-managed with medication. He also has hyperlipidemia and a remote history of myocardial infarction at age 65. He receives regular follow-ups for his cardiac condition and takes aspirin and a statin.   Family History: There is no known family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However  his older brother experienced a myocardial infarction in his early 70s  suggesting a hereditary predisposition to cardiovascular disease.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. His blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg in both arms  and heart rate 76 bpm. There is no lower limb edema. Peripheral pulses are intact. Hematological and biochemical blood investigations  including full blood count  renal function  liver function  and serum electrolytes  are all within normal limits.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An ultrasound examination of the abdomen confirms the presence of an AAA with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm. The patient is referred for a CT angiogram for further assessment and planning for possible intervention.   Discussion: The patient's age  sex  hypertension  and history of cardiovascular disease significantly increase his risk for an AAA. The American Heart Association recommends one-time screening for AAA with abdominal ultrasound in men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked. Despite being a non-smoker  the patient's other risk factors warrant consideration for the AAA screening.   In line with the guideline  any AAA 5.5 cm or larger should be considered for repair to prevent rupture. Given the patient's cardiovascular history  both open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair should be discussed with the patient alongside their potential risks and benefits.   Patient Care Plan: The patient should be counseled regarding the nature of his illness  need for surgical intervention  and potential risks associated. Involvement of a cardiothoracic surgeon is necessary for further management. The patient's hypertension should be optimally controlled preoperatively.   It's imperative to monitor the patient's lipid profile and cardiac condition continually and manage these in coordination with a cardiologist. Lifestyle modification measures including a healthy diet  regular exercise  limiting alcohol intake should all be emphasized. Regardless of surgery  the patient should have regular follow-up imaging of his aneurysm every six months.   Ethnicity and geographical considerations: While the above case represents a typical patient with AAA  it's worth noting that the epidemiology of AAA varies worldwide. The overall prevalence in men over 65 is about 1.5% and is additionally common in Caucasians. Though less common in non-Caucasian populations  awareness and management strategies need to be similarly rigorous.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,80,Case Presentation:   The patient  Mr. Gallagher  is a 71-year-old Caucasian man living in San Francisco  California  USA. He is retired and used to work as a construction engineer. He currently lives with his wife and three adult children in a suburban neighborhood.   He has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and has been on medication for the same. Mr. Gallagher has no history of diabetes mellitus or any heart diseases but has a history of hypercholesterolemia. He was also a heavy smoker  averaging one pack a day for about 35 years before he quit smoking 5 years ago.   Mr. Gallagher first presented in the emergency room complaining about persistent  unmitigated abdominal and lower back pain  which he described as 'sharp and crippling'  rating it 8 on a scale of 10. He also reported episodes of nausea and feelings of general fatigue over the past two weeks.   On examination  his blood pressure was consistently borderline high (140/85 mmHg)  with a pulse rate of about 80 bpm. He has a high BMI (28.3 kg/m2)  indicating that he is overweight. Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was noticed in his abdomen  which raised suspicion of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).  This suspicion was further confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound which showed a 5.5cm dilatation in the aorta. A CT scan was also performed to aid in the preoperative planning of intervention due to the patient's chronic symptoms and the size of the aneurysm.  His past medical history includes hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking  and being overweight  which are all risk factors known to be associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. His father died of a stroke at 78 years of age and he has a brother diagnosed with an AAA at 66 years old.   The patient has been recommended for an immediate surgical intervention to manage the AAA. He has been informed about the risks involved and the postoperative care that will be necessary following the surgery. The need for lifestyle changes such as regular exercise  a controlled diet  and maintaining a healthy body weight have also been discussed to manage his hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  and thus reduce the risk of cardiovascular and aneurysmal complications in the future.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,81,Patient Profile:  Mr. John Doe  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  retired civil engineer from New York  presents with a complaint of lower abdominal and back pain that have been persistent over the past week. The patient has been relatively healthy  with only an existing diagnosis of hypertension for the last seven years  managed with medication (Hydrochlorothiazide). The patient reports compliance with his medication. He also underwent an appendectomy at age 25. His body mass index (BMI) is 26.1  indicating mild obesity.  Personal History:  Mr. Doe has been a smoker for the past 40 years  consuming about a pack a day. He enjoys a glass or two of red wine almost every day post-retirement. His diet consists mainly of home-cooked meals where his salt and cholesterol intake have been consciously monitored  considering his hypertension. He likes to walk his Labrador in the park daily for exercise. There's no history of drug abuse or any known allergies to food and medication.  Family History:  Mr. Doe's father passed away at the age of 72 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother died at age 79 due to natural causes. His older brother  aged 72  was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His children  a 40-year-old son and a 37-year-old daughter  are both in good health.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  his blood pressure was noted to be 145/90 mmHg  slightly above his usual readings. Other vital signs (heart rate  respiratory rate  temperature) were within normal limits. On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in the periumbilical area. Bowel sounds were noted to be normal.  Radiology:  Given the familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysm and the clinical findings  a CT scan was ordered which indeed confirmed a 6.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management:  Mr. Doe was counseled about his condition and the need for urgent surgical intervention  given the size of his aneurysm. He was scheduled for an open surgical repair. Lifestyle modifications were stressed  especially smoking cessation and control of hypertension.  Follow-up:  Outpatient follow-up appointments every month post-surgery have been scheduled for the first six months to monitor the repair site and control his blood pressure. It would also include counseling for lifestyle and dietary changes. His family members are suggested to undergo screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm due to its evident familial occurrence.  This case highlights the relevance of thorough physical examinations and detailed family histories in diametrically influencing patient care  given the potential fatal consequences of asymptomatic pathologies such as abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,82,Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John  who was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He retired 4 years ago from his occupation as a manager in a construction firm. John is married  has three children  and lives with his wife. He is an ex-smoker with a 30 pack-year history but quit when he turned 60. He consumes alcohol moderately.   Past Medical History: John has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years and statins for his hyperlipidemia. There is no history of diabetes  vascular disease or renal disease. He had a hip replacement surgery five years ago due to osteoarthritis.  Family History: John's father died from a ruptured AAA at the age of 75. His mother passed away from stroke-related complications at 82. His older brother  who is 70 years old  recently had an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for AAA. There is no family history of coronary artery disease  stroke  Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)  diabetes or cancer.   Presenting Complaints: John reported discomfort in his lower back and a feeling of fullness in his abdomen that has persisted over few weeks. He described the pain as dull aching and is not radiating. No associated symptoms like fever  altered bowel habits  bloating or weight loss were reported.  Clinical Finding and Diagnosis: On physical exam  John had a palpable abdominal mass which was pulsatile indicative of an AAA. In order to confirm the diagnosis  an abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed a 5.4 cm infrarenal AAA.  Treatment Plan: The plan is to discuss potential treatment options with John including watchful waiting  endovascular repair or open surgical repair depending on his overall health status  risks  and the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm.  AAA is a condition common among the older population  predominantly in Caucasian males  with risk factors such as a family history and smoking being highly associated with the disease. It is highly important for clinicians to have high suspicion among patients who are older  male  smokers with a family history of AAA presenting with abdominal or back pain to ensure early referral for surgical intervention and optimal management. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,83,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male  a retired construction worker  who was diagnosed with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The patient resides in a Midwest suburb. He currently lives alone  having been widowed six years earlier. He is a father of 3 and grandfather to 5.  Medical History: The patient has a significant history of hypertension  high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes  which are all controlled with medication. The patient was a heavy smoker who quit 15 years ago  but consumed alcohol socially. He does not exercise regularly but maintains a balanced diet. His BMI is 29  within the range of obesity.   Presenting Problems: The patient experienced occasional episodes of mild abdominal pain radiating to his lower back over the last couple of weeks. Initially  he attributed this to indigestion and did not seek medical attention until the pain became severe and was associated with a sense of his heartbeat in his abdomen. He had no other symptoms like fever  nausea  or hematuria.   Examination and Diagnosis: An abdominal examination has confirmed a pulsating mass predominantly centrally located and abdominal ultrasound subsequently showed an AAA of 6cm. Given his severe abdominal and back pain emergency surgical consult was sought. CT angiography confirmed the size and revealed a partially thrombosed AAA with no signs of rupture.  Family History: His father had a history of AAA and died in his late sixties from a cardiac event. His mother died from breast cancer. His older brother also has hypertension and type II diabetes.  Discussion: AAA is prevalent in males over 65 years  particularly those with a history of smoking  hypertension  or a family history of AAA (Brady  et al.  2016). African American men have a significant risk  especially if they have a comorbidity like diabetes and hyperlipidemia as our patient (Sampson  et al.  2014). It's noteworthy that he embodies multiple risk factors  such as being over 65  male  a former smoker  and diabetic. It's also reported that African Americans are less likely to undergo screening for AAA (Sampson  et al.  2014)  which makes early detection difficult.  References: 1. Brady  A. R.  Thompson  S. G.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,84,Patient Presentation  Demographics: Mr. X is a 72-year-old African American man who resides in an urban setting. Literature suggests that an abdominal aortic aneurysm is prevalent in this demographic  particularly in men over the age of 65.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reports a history of vague and intermittent abdominal discomfort for the past 3 months. On his recent visit  he mentioned that the pain has escalated  radiating to his lower back.  Medical History: Mr. X has been hypertensive for 15 years  for which he takes amlodipine 10 mg daily. He has also been a smoker for 50 years and has continued to smoke a pack/day. He reports no known allergies.  Family History: His father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 65  and his mother has a history of hypertension. He has a younger brother who was recently diagnosed with a small abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Examination Findings: On physical examination  a pulsatile mass in the abdomen was palpable. His blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  and heart rate was regular at 80 beats per minute. Casting further concern  his four extremities' pulses were regular but weak.  Investigations: An abdominal ultrasound confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 5.5cm  qualifying him for surgical evaluation. Lab tests including blood counts  liver and kidney function  and coagulation profile were within normal limits. Chest X-ray was unremarkable  but an EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy  likely due to longstanding hypertension.  Impression: Mr. X has a significant risk of aneurysm rupture due to his history of smoking  hypertension  advancing age  and family history. His symptoms suggest risk for rupture  necessitating timely intervention.  Management: Mr. X was educated about the urgency and need for surgical intervention  due to the risk of rupture. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon to discuss the most appropriate surgical intervention  such as open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair. For risk reduction  he was advised to cease smoking and ensure control of his hypertension. The healthcare team will also closely monitor and manage his pain to prevent any further complications.    Follow Up: Patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit after one week to evaluate the progress of his hypertension and overall health status. He will also undergo pre-operative evaluation for surgery  including a cardiac stress test due to the EKG findings. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,85,Case Presentation  Patient's Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  from the upper-middle socio-economic status  presently residing in Tampa  Florida. He is recently retired after spending most of his life working in the banking sector. He is a chronic smoker and has a history of hypertension  both risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). He also indulges in moderate alcohol consumption.   Family History:  There is a family history of AAA  with his father having experienced a ruptured AAA at the age of 75.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson consulted with his primary care doctor due to an episodic abdominal discomfort he felt while engaging in mild physical activities. He also reported back pain  tenderness in the abdomen  and unexplained weight loss for a couple of months.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Following his complaint  an abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed a 5cm dilatation in the lower part of the aorta  consistent with an AAA. A subsequent CT scan confirmed the size  location  and extent of the AAA. Blood tests were normal except for slightly increased cholesterol levels.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson is a known hypertensive for the past 10 years. He is on regular medication (Lisinopril and Amlodipine) and has relatively controlled blood pressure. He was also diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus five years ago  which is being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin). He had an elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) done seven years ago. He does not have any history of pulmonary diseases or kidney diseases.  Physical Examination: Mr. Johnson has a BMI of 27.1  indicating he is overweight. He appeared in good health with no signs of distress and was well-oriented. Cardiovascular examination was within normal limits with no murmurs  gallops  or rubs heard. His abdomen was slightly distended and a pulsatile mass was palpable in the mid and upper abdomen.   Management and Prognosis: Given the size of the AAA  its rapid increase  and his risk factors  Mr. Johnson was referred to a vascular surgeon for a possible endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A detailed discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure was carried out with the patient. His medication was adjusted  with increased focus on controlling hypertension and cholesterol levels  and he has been advised to quit smoking and control his diabetes effectively. If left untreated  the AAA could rupture  leading to a life-threatening situation.   In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's AAA is a consequence of his genetic predisposition  lifestyle choices  advanced age  and chronic hypertension. His prognosis would largely depend on his response to intervention  continued medical management of risk factors  and lifestyle modifications.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,86,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J  who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset severe abdominal pain radiating to his back that started 6 hours ago. Mr. J identifies his discomfort as “tearing” in nature  rating it as a ten out of ten in severity  not relieved by any at-home measures. He denied having any heat intolerance  visible weight loss  nor symptoms related to thyroid disease.  Demographics:   Mr. J reports living alone since his wife’s passing five years ago. He is a retired postal worker and does not engage in any form of regular physical exercise. He has a 40-pack-year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. His diet consists of mostly fast and processed foods. His BMI is 30  putting him in the obese category. He does not consume alcohol and denies any illicit drug use.   Medical History:   He has a past medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and Type 2 diabetes. Medications include metformin  hydrochlorothiazide  and Lipitor. He had an appendectomy at 30 and has no known drug allergies. Mr. J is not under the care of a cardiologist  and his last health check was three years ago.   Family History:   Both of Mr. J’s parents passed away in their early 80s. His father had a history of stroke and coronary artery disease  whereas his mother had breast cancer and arthritis. He has two older brothers; both have diabetes and hypertension. His only sister had ovarian cancer.  Diagnosis:  Based on the severing back pain  Mr. J's obesity  and his age  in combination with symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  the physician ordered an abdominal aortic ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large (5.8 cm in diameter) abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in Caucasian males  over 65  with a history of smoking and family history of AAAs. Hypertension and high cholesterol  both found in Mr. J’s history  are significant risks. As Mr. J is 70 years old  obese  with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  he was at a very high risk of an AAA. The sudden  severe  and persistent abdominal and back pain was indicative of a potentially rupturing AAA  requiring immediate surgical intervention.  Emergency surgery was scheduled  and the patient was provided with counseling regarding the benefits and risks. The patient agreed to proceed.   This case demonstrates the importance of considering life-threatening conditions like AAA In patients who present with acute abdominal pain  particularly in those with relevant risk factors. Regular healthcare checks  especially in individuals with multiple comorbidities  are crucial in early diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,87,Case Presentation:  Subject specifications: A 62-year-old African American male  Mr. J.  Presenting complaints: Mr. J was initially brought into the emergency department complaining about a sudden  sharp pain in his lower back and abdomen  particularly severe on left.  Past medical history: Records indicate he's a diabetic  with a history of uncontrolled hypertension.  Smoking history: He reports being a regular smoker for the last 40 years.  Family history: His father had passed due to complications from aortic aneurysm in his 60s. He has no siblings. His eldest son  in his early 40s  has no known cardiovascular diseases.  Examination: On presentation  he appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was high at 170/90mmHg  other vital signs were within normal ranges. On examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in his abdomen. Initial investigations (ECG  chest-X-ray  lab tests) showed normal heart function  but high blood glucose levels and moderate anaemia.  Diagnosis: A CT angiogram was performed  which confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Management: Considering the high risk of rupture due to the size of the aneurysm (>5cm)  emergency surgery was planned. Considering his uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes  these were managed preoperatively. He underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  post which his vital signs and general condition improved significantly. He received counselling for smoking cessation  dietary modifications and regular exercise.  Follow-up: He was discharged and scheduled for outpatient follow-up with vascular surgery  endocrinology (for diabetes management)  and cardiology for his hypertension. His physiological as well as emotional well-being was assessed during follow-ups.  This case presents a common scenario involving an African American older adult male with an AAA and several risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  diabetes and significant family history. Attention to these factors during assessment may lead to earlier identification and intervention for AAAs  which can prevent rupture and significantly improve the quality of life in these individuals.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,88,Introduction:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  hailing from middle-class socioeconomic status and who lives in Florida. He claims to have quit smoking 10 years ago but has a smoking history of 30 years. He drinks alcohol socially and has no history of illicit drug use.  Presenting Problem: He presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe abdominal and lower back pain radiating towards his buttock. He denies associated chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or lower limb weakness.  Past Medical and Family History: Patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medication. He is compliant with his regular medication - Atenolol and Atorvastatin. There is no known history of diabetes  stroke  or any other chronic illnesses. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  as his father had a myocardial infarction at 68.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: On examination  there is a palpable pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 160/90 mmHg. Lab results demonstrate no leukocytosis or increased renal markers. CT angiography confirms the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 7 cm in diameter.  Discussion: AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture  where it presents as severe abdominal or back pain  typically in males above 65. Risk factors include older age  male sex  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of AAA. The patient’s age  sex  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease put him at high risk. The patient’s aneurysm  at 7cm  exceeds the 5.5 cm threshold for elective surgical intervention in men.  Management Plan: Immediate surgical consultation was obtained for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  considering the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture. Patient was also started on intravenous antihypertensive therapy to control his blood pressure until surgery was performed.  Conclusion: Awareness of the presentation  risk factors  and appropriate management can facilitate early recognition and treatment of AAA  leading to improved patient outcomes.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,89,Patient Overview:  Patient: Mr. John Smith Age: 72 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Urban setting  Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian man  came to the hospital complaining of severe  constant pain in his abdominal region and back that started about one week ago. He reports feeling unsteady while walking  and has experienced a significant lack of appetite.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has been hypertensive for the past 20 years. He has been sporadic with his blood pressure medication due to financial constraints. He is a former smoker  having quit 30 years ago but had puffed up to one pack daily for 20 years prior to cessation. He doesn't consume alcohol. He had a heart attack around 10 years ago but he made a complete recovery after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He is also prediabetic but has not yet started any medication for it.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction and his mother died at the age of 70 because of stroke. One of his two brothers had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was successfully repaired. This indicates a potential genetic predisposition to aneurysms in the family.   Examination:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was 160/110 mm Hg and pulse rate was 90 beats per minute. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsating abdominal mass. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.6 cm.  Discussion:  Given the above information  the patient’s recognised risk factors for the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm include advanced age  male gender  history of smoking  hypertension  and potentially a genetic predisposition. The reported severe abdominal and back pain coupled with the physical exam findings raised suspicion of AAA  making the finding of the pulsating abdominal mass an important clue in the diagnosis.   In literature  males over 60 years  smokers  Caucasians  and individuals with a family history of AAA have a higher risk of developing the disease (US Preventive Services Task Force  2019). These factors align with Mr Smith's profile thereby placing him at greater risk.   Given the size of the aneurysm and the severity of his pain  there is a significant risk of rupture. Urgent surgical evaluation is recommended for Mr. Smith because of the large size of his AAA  his pain symptoms  and the risk of rupture associated with these factors.  Management:  After discussing with Mr. Smith the pros and cons of open surgery versus endovascular repair  he agreed to undergo endovascular aneurysm repair  which is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time. His blood pressure and prediabetic state must be monitored and managed accordingly to prevent postoperative complications.  Further steps would include lifestyle changes to control his blood pressure levels and strict glucose monitoring  assisting him to get access to affordable medications  regular monitoring for post repair complications  and screening his immediate family due to the high risk of AAA heredity. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,90,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Jose Alvarez is a 69-year-old Hispanic male with a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This patient has a history of hypertension and 20-year history of smoking  although he quit 10 years ago. His past medical history shows periods of chest pain  occasional syncope  and kidney stones for which he did not pursue aggressive treatment but managed symptomatically. He also has moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and intermittent claudication on exertion  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease.  Family History:  He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died at 56 due to myocardial infarction and his older brother at 65 due to stroke. His mother is 90 years old and healthy. Two of Mr. Alvarez's four adult children have been diagnosed with hypertension and one is a smoker. His youngest brother  who is currently 55  was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Social History:  Residing in a rural area  Mr. Alvarez is a retired carpenter with an annual income below the federal poverty level. His wife of 45 years provides home care; they have four children and seven grandchildren. He does not drink alcohol and quit smoking a decade ago.  Current Situation:  Five months ago  during a routine examination for renal stones  an ultrasound incidentally noted an infra-renal AAA measuring 4 cm in diameter. Repeat imaging two months later suggested that the size had increased to 5.5 cm. After consultation with vascular surgery  plans were made for an elective endovascular repair.   Assessment:  Mr. Alvarez falls into the category of patients most likely to develop an AAA - male  over 65  history of smoking  hypertension  and a family history of AAA. The growth rate of his AAA is concerning  as it is now approaching the 5.5 cm diameter threshold for surgical intervention considering his symptomatic situation.   Plan:  A plan has been established for endovascular repair with continued monitoring post-operatively. Lifestyle modifications emphasizing blood pressure control  smoking cessation for his son  a healthy diet  and regular exercise have been recommended. We also stressed on the importance of regular follow-ups and screenings for his siblings and children considering the familial link in AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,91,Case Presentation:  Patient Bio:   The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  residing in a suburban community near a metropolitan city in the United States. He is a retired construction worker and is currently living with his wife. The patient has a history of smoking approximately one pack a day for 40 years  but he quit about 15 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally. His diet is high in fat and low in fiber. He also leads a sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise.   Past Medical History:   The patient's medical history includes an ongoing treatment for chronic hypertension. He also had undergone a coronary stent placement seven years ago for managing his ischemic heart disease. The patient is diabetic and has been prescribed metformin and insulin therapy. He has a BMI of 29  placing him in the overweight range. He has been taking statins for his hyperlipidemia.  Family History:  His father died from a suspected myocardial infarction at 76  and his mother passed away from stroke at the age of 80. His older brother had surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm five years ago.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient came to the Emergency Department with complaints of unrelenting  sharp abdominal and lower back pain for the past few hours. The pain was not associated with food intake or posture. There were no accompanying symptoms of nausea  vomiting  shortness of breath  or chest pain.  On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated  and an abdominal bruit was heard on auscultation. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Based on the history  clinical examination  and familial history  a high suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm was put forward. Immediate CT angiography confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.5 cm.  Management Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the associated symptoms  urgent surgical intervention was decided upon discussion with the vascular surgeon. He was scheduled for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The patient was also referred for a genetic counselling because of his family history of aortic aneurysms.  In the long term  emphasis will be given to managing his risk factors which include his hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. A dietitian will provide nutritional guidance to help achieve a healthier weight and reduce his cardiovascular risk. Pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccinations are also recommended due to his smoking history.  This case is an example of how numerous lifestyle factors  previous medical conditions  and genetic predisposition can contribute to the development of serious cardiovascular diseases like abdominal aortic aneurysms. Comprehensive case management  addressing both the acute surgical need and the chronic health issues  becomes crucial in such patients.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,92,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. D Williams Age: 72 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Married Profession: Retired Engineer  Chief Complaint: Mr. Williams was referred for a routine check-up following a mildly concerning finding of a backache during his annual physical examination. The backache was felt in the abdominal region and lower back.  Past Medical History: He is a known case of Hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication. Previously  he had an occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago. Regular smoker for the past 40 years  consuming 15 cigarettes/day but quit two years ago. Limited alcohol consumption to social events only. No history of drug abuse. No known allergies.  Family History: His father had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and passed away at the age of 78 due to myocardial infarction. His elder brother has been recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaints: Unexplained lower back pain and mild abdominal discomfort for the past couple of weeks. No associated complaint of chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness. Bowels and urination were normal.  Physical Examination: Vital signs stable. Aneurysm detected at abdominal aorta  through physical examination via palpation but no visible signs or pulsation.  Investigations: Abdominal Ultrasound revealed an enlarged abdominal aorta  with a diameter of 5.5 cm indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). ECG and chest X-ray were normal.   Management: Mr. Williams was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon and a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) for further management. Following a detailed discussion  the team recommended high-intensity statin therapy to control his lipid levels and continued control of his blood pressure. Surgical intervention is contemplated as the aneurysm size is above the threshold of intervention (5.5 cm).   Follow-up: Mr. Williams is scheduled for a periodic follow-up every three months to monitor the size of the aneurysm  along with regular blood pressure and lipid profile checks.   This case demonstrates an instance of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with a history of HTN  hyperlipidemia  and a familial predisposition towards aneurysms and cardiovascular disease. Timely detection and intervention are crucial in such cases to avoid catastrophic outcomes such as rupture and death. Regular monitoring and maintenance of cardiovascular health are advised.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,93,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 72-Year-Old Hispanic Male  Patient Profile The patient  Mr. Alvarez  is a 72-year-old Hispanic male retired engineer  currently living with his spouse. He has been experiencing lower back pain and a pulsating feeling in his abdomen for the past few months. He is a non-smoker and moderate drinker  and he reported physical exercise of 150 minutes a week. He has a family history of coronary heart diseases (father died from heart attack) and cancer.  Past Medical History In terms of past medical history  Mr. Alvarez was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago and is currently being well managed with medication (lisinopril  20 mg daily). In the past  he has had benign prostate hyperplasia treated with terazosin. Furthermore  he suffered a mild stroke at the age of 65 with no significant residual effects. He also underwent a colonoscopy at 60 that found no abnormalities.  Presenting Condition Recently  Mr. Alvarez has been complaining of abdominal pain and discomfort  often describing this as a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. During a routine check-up  palpation of the abdominal region led to suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which was later confirmed by a CT abdominal angiogram. The aneurysm was measured to be 5.5 cm in diameter. A high-resolution ultrasound further confirmed the diagnosis.  Family History There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Mr. Alvarez's father died from a heart attack at the age of 73 and his older brother had a myocardial infarction at 67. His mother had a long history of hypertension but lived to the age of 90. His sister has type II diabetes  and his maternal grandfather was reported to have died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Lifestyle Factors Mr. Alvarez has a moderately active lifestyle for his age. He walks for 30 minutes daily and practices yoga twice a week. His diet is largely Mediterranean  with a moderate intake of alcohol. Previously  he worked as a civil engineer  but since his retirement  he has been involved in volunteer work.  Indicated Diagnostic Tests Due to the size of the aneurysm and given the patient’s age and comorbidities  surgical intervention has been considered. After conferring with a consultant vascular surgeon  the patient was counseled for elective open surgery  considering his overall good health and active lifestyle.  Conclusion This report illustrates that abdominal aortic aneurysms  while typically asymptomatic until rupture  can at times present with non-specific symptoms such as lower back pain and a pulsating sensation in the abdomen. If a patient has a family history of AAA  this could potentially clue the clinician to the correct diagnosis. Moreover  the management of AAA depends on a variety of factors  including patient qualities and aneurysm characteristics  suggesting a personalized care approach.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,94,Patient Information: Mr. Jacob Henderson is a 72-year-old African-American male residing in the Washington  D.C. area. He has been diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after a routine physical examination.  Medical History: Mr. Henderson's past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus  all of which he has been managing diligently. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years but has quit smoking since the last five years. He has no known allergies. His other histories include cholecystectomy approximately 20 years ago and periodic bouts of bronchitis. Mr. Henderson has been on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. There are no records of previous surgeries or blood transfusions.  Family History: Mr. Henderson's father passed away due to AAA complications at the age of 76  and his older brother was known to have AAA but passed away in a car accident. He has two sons in their 40s with no known cardiovascular disease. His wife of 48 years passed away lately from ovarian cancer. Cancer's prevalence has been high in his family with his mother dying of breast cancer  and his younger sister is currently battling with colon cancer.  Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis: He presented to the clinic with complaints of vague  intermittent abdominal discomfort and lower back pain for the past two months. No symptoms of syncope  chest pain  or shortness of breath were noted. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Further radiological assessments through an abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of AAA with a diameter of 5.4cm.  Management & Follow-Up Plan: Given the size of the aneurysm and the associated risk factors  vascular surgical consultation recommended for considering possible surgical intervention. Smoking cessation  strict glycemic control  lipid control  and blood pressure management are critical. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled within four weeks to discuss the option of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or traditional open repair  with consideration to Mr. Henderson's comorbid conditions and personal preference.  Demographics: The prevalence of AAA in the general population is 4-8%  primarily affecting men over 65 who have a history of smoking. African American ethnicity is  on average  less frequently associated with AAA compared to the Caucasian population but in this case  genetic predisposition can be inferred from the familial history of the disease.  Discussion: Management of AAA requires a comprehensive approach that includes careful consideration of risk factors  symptoms  aneurysm size  and patient preference. Early detection and timely therapeutic interventions are key to prevent catastrophic outcomes such as aneurysm rupture. Furthermore  lifestyle modification measures  including smoking cessation  management of diabetes  and hypertension  are also crucial.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,97,Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the hospital reporting severe abdominal pain that intermittently radiates to his lower back. Mr. Johnson is a retired firefighter and lives with his wife in an urban city in the U.S. He has a history of heavy smoking but quit five years ago. The patient's body mass index is stable at 26  and he maintains a relatively active lifestyle. Apart from his hypertension diagnosis five years ago  he has been generally in good health.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson was initially seen at an urgent care clinic four days ago  complaining of persistent abdominal discomfort. The pain  which he described as 'ripping' in character  has become progressively worse. He denies any associated symptoms such as vomiting  fever  or changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension  has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years  and drinks alcohol occasionally. No known allergies have been recorded. Regarding medical history  Mr. Johnson has been hospitalized once in the past for a minor heart attack at age 68.  Family History: His father died at the age of 64 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother died at 69 from complications related to diabetes. There is no known family history of aneurysms.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appeared anxious and his abdominal pain seemed to intensify when lying flat on his back. His vitals were: Blood pressure - 146/90 mmHg  Pulse - 98 beats/min  Respiratory rate - 20 breaths/min  Oxygen saturation - 97% on room air  and Temperature - 37.2°C. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the periumbilical area.  Investigations: Lab tests showed a mild leukocytosis. His chest x-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. An abdominal ultrasound  followed by a CT angiogram  confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management Plan: The patient was urgently referred to the vascular surgery team due to the size of the aneurysm. After detailed discussion with the surgeon  open repair of the aneurysm was planned. His family was involved in the decision-making process to ensure patient-centric care  understanding the risks and benefits associated with surgery.  Outcome: The surgery was successful without any complications. He was monitored in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for close observation. After the surgery  the patient underwent a smoking cessation and rehabilitation program as well. Mr. Johnson was discharged in a stable condition after 11 days.  Follow-up: Regular follow-up appointments and ultrasound monitoring have been organized to monitor for possible complications  such as aneurysm expansion or leak. Medications for his hypertension were adjusted  and he was advised on a low sodium and cholesterol diet  along with regular exercise  to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to prevent further vascular issues.   Patient Education: Outlined the importance of lifestyle changes including smoking cessation  diet modifications  and regular exercise. Reviewed signs and symptoms to be vigilant for  such as sudden severe pain in the abdomen or back  or changes in urination habits.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,98,Patient Presentation  Patient Description:   The patient is a 72-year-old White male  retired  who lives with his wife. He has two adult children with families of their own.   Presenting Complaint:   He complains of persistent abdominal pain  sporadic lower back discomfort  and fatigue.  History of Present Illness:   The patient mentions that the onset of abdominal pain occurred about three weeks ago  starting as a dull ache in the lower abdomen which gradually became more intense. The discomfort to his lower back is mainly only felt when standing for prolonged periods. He also reports feeling fatigue and shortness of breath during the last few days. However  There's no palpable abdominal mass. There is no history of trauma. No associated fever  chills  chest pain  or weight loss.  Past Medical History:   His past medical history is significant for hypertension and high cholesterol levels for which he has been on medication for many years. The patient also has a history of smoking  with a 50 pack-year  but he quit about 10 years ago. The patient doesn't have any known allergies.  Family History:  He reveals that his father suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 75 and he has a brother suffering from peripheral vascular disease. The patient doesn't have any family history of kidney disease or any other major systemic diseases.  Investigations:  Physical examination showed regular heart rate and rhythm with no evidence of acute distress. Abdominal examination revealed a mild tenderness in the lower abdomen with no palpable pulsatile mass but with good femoral pulses bilaterally. Laboratory tests were within normal limits except for elevated cholesterol levels.   Upon further assessment using ultrasound imaging  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of about 5.6 cm was detected. The patient was then referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and surgical intervention considering his age and the size of the aneurysm.  Discussion:   In this case  the patient's history of smoking  hypertension  high blood cholesterol  and family history of AAA and peripheral vascular disease places him at high risk for developing an AAA. Early detection  surgical intervention  and the control of risk factors are crucial in preventing fatal ruptures. Patient education on the importance of regular follow-up  monitoring of aneurysm size  and control of hypertension and cholesterol is also key in managing this condition.   In light of the patient's history and the current prognosis  the vascular surgeon has recommended an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) considering its low perioperative risk and recovery period. His family has been supportive and compliant with the medical advice given so far and the patient has agreed to move forward with the treatment plan.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,99,"Subject: An 70-year-old Male Diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  1. Demographics:  The patient is an unmarried 70-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity. He retired from his job as a construction worker five years ago. He is a long-time smoker with a 50-pack-year history  has chronic hypertension and high cholesterol  but does not have a personal or family history of heart disease. He is currently living with his sister.  2. Past and Present History: The patient has a history of two significant health issues: hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He has been taking Losartan 50 mg and Atorvastatin 20 mg for the last seven years  and his blood pressure and cholesterol levels have been controlled within acceptable limits. He was also diagnosed with COPD  attributed to his long history of smoking  five years ago  for which he uses inhaled corticosteroids.  3. Current Presentation: The patient presented with a complaint of gradual onset  unrelenting sharp abdominal and back pain which he rates as an 8 on a scale of 1-10. He stated that the pain began two days prior and has been steadily worsening. He doesn't recall any precipitating event or injury. The patient reported feeling a """"pulsating"""" sensation in his abdomen  and states that the pain seems unassociated with food or position.  4. Family History: There's no reported family history of heart diseases or aneurysms. The patient's father lived until 82 and died of a stroke; his mother lived until 78 and passed away due to lung cancer. He has two siblings  a younger brother with diabetes and an elder sister with rheumatoid arthritis.   5. Professional Considerations: The patient's age  ethnicity (Hispanic)  gender (male)  smoking history  and hypertension are all common risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Older age  male sex  and history of smoking are reported as significant risk factors for AAA as found in various pieces of literature.  6. Diagnostic Procedures & Results: Upon physical examination  the doctor identified a pulsatile abdominal mass. The occurrence of intense abdominal pain along with the presence of this mass raised the suspicion of a rupturing AAA  which was then confirmed through a computed tomography angiogram (CTA). The CTA also revealed that the AAA's diameter is 7.5cm.  In alignment with the demographics found in the literature  this case shows that men  particularly those who have smoked  have hypertension  and are of an advanced age  are more likely to suffer from an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The lack of family history does not rule out the risk factor  as primarily  AAA involves the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure. In any patient with this demographic profile and these symptoms  AAA should be a consideration in differential diagnosis. "
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,9,100,Patient Information: Mr. James A.  a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: “Rapid and intense pain in my lower back and abdomen.”  History of Present Illness: The patient has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain for the past month  which has suddenly escalated today. Accompanying symptoms include fainting  rapid pulse  excessive sweatiness  and pallor. Unknown history of past similar instances.  Medical History: Diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  managed by medications. Has a five-year history of high cholesterol  treated by diet modification and statin medications. Smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years  stopped smoking 5 years ago. Had a minor heart attack at the age of 65  treated by stenting. No known drug allergies.  Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg daily  Lipitor 20 mg daily  aspirin 81 mg daily  Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily.  Family History: Father died from a heart attack at 68  mother passed away due to complications from diabetes at 72. One older brother with a history of hypertension and another older brother  who had a stroke at age 73.   Physical Exam: Pale  anxious older man. He is tender in the middle and lower abdomen  no scars were noticed. BP 90/60 mmHg  pulse 120  respirations 24  temperature 37.3°C.  Investigations: CT angiography of the abdomen was performed showing a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.5 cm.  Assessment & Plan: The patient was diagnosed with a potentially ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm apparent from his history  physical examination  and CT findings. Considering patient's age  co-morbidities; history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of cardiovascular diseases increased his risk for AAA. Plans are in place for an immediate referral to a vascular surgeon for emergent repair. IV fluid resuscitation was initiated in the ER along with strict monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate.   Follow-up/Prognosis: Management of AAA generally includes surgery  with regular follow-ups. Controlling blood pressure will be important in this patient's post-operative stage to reduce the risk of complications. His prognosis depends on his surgical outcome  control of his chronic conditions and lifestyle changes  including maintaining a heart-healthy diet  appropriate physical activity  and continued abstinence from smoking.   This case demonstrates the classic presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm that could be complicated by rupture in a patient with significant risk factors as supported by literature. Urgent intervention is crucial in these cases given the high mortality risk. Regular follow-up and strict control of his medical conditions can improve his prognosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,1,Case Subject: Mr. George Johnson  Demographics:  Mr. Johnson is a 69-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired construction worker  married  with three grown children. He is a lifelong resident of a rural area where he enjoys outdoor activities like fishing and gardening. He’s had a history of heavy smoking (30 pack years  quit 15 years ago) and has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 20 years  controlled by medication.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Johnson visited his primary health care provider reporting a persistent lower back pain  occasional abdominal pain  and unexplained fatigue for the past month. He described the pain as a dull ache  more noticeable when he’s been motioning or after heavy meals. He also mentioned recent unexplained weight loss.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension (Diagnosed 20 years ago)  managed with a calcium channel blocker - Former heavy smoker ((30 pack years  quit 15 years ago) - No history of diabetes or high cholesterol - No known family history of cardiovascular disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm - A clearance of colorectal cancer through colonoscopy five years prior - Last annual check-up showed normal results  Physical Findings: On general examination  Mr. Johnson had a blood pressure of 145/85 mm Hg and resting pulse rate of 68 bpm. A palpable pulsatile mass in the central abdomen was felt on physical examination. No peripheral edema or clubbing noted. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.   Given the demographic background  past medical history  and presenting complaints  an abdominal aortic aneurysm stands as a potential diagnosis for this case. Further diagnostic tests  including ultrasound or CT scan  would be recommended to confirm the presence of the aneurysm and assess its size and risk of rupture.   This case is designed with a patient profile that matches the typical risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm as found in medical literature—being over the age of 65  male  a former smoker  and having hypertension. This case presentation is built to enhance disease understanding and management for medical students  underlining the importance of a thorough evaluation for patients presenting with non-specific symptoms like unexplained back or abdominal pain.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,2,Patient Information: Name: X  Gender: Male Age: 72 years  Background:  Mr. X is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired dockyard worker and a former smoker having quit 10 years ago. He has been moderately alcohol dependent for the past 30 years and consumes a diet rich in fast foods and red meat.  Past Medical History: The primary complaints from Mr. X include a long-standing history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago. Also  he was diagnosed and treated for peripheral artery disease around 3 years back. His father suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at 69 years old but survived after emergency surgery.  Presenting Complaints: In recent weeks  Mr. X has been experiencing an increasing frequency of dull  vague abdominal pain typically in the midabdominal region. The pain can get severe and radiate towards the lower back. He has been feeling full sooner than usual while eating and has unexplained weight loss. This is accompanied by pulses that feel more prominent than usual in the abdominal area. Also  he complains of general lethargy and anxiety.   Note - The abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalence is highest in elderly Caucasian males. Risk factors include a history of smoking  alcohol use  a diet high in fat  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a family history of aortic aneurysms. Quick identification and treatment of the condition can prevent serious complications. This case is designed to train students to recognize these risk factors and symptoms leading to early diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,3,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented in the health facility accompanied by his son.  Past Medical History:  The patient has been previously treated for hypertension and high cholesterol. He was a smoker but he managed to quit 10 years ago. His father died of an aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 75.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Doe has been experiencing a strange sensation of pain in his lower back that radiates to his abdomen and groin  which has been increasing in intensity over the last few weeks. Associated symptoms include a constant feeling of fullness in the abdomen  occasional abdominal pain  and bouts of nausea. He denies bowel or urinary changes  chest pain  or any recent illness or injury. He also reported feeling lightheaded at times and was recommended to visit the hospital by his general practitioner after palpating a mass during a routine health checkup.  Importance:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a condition seen more frequently in the elderly  predominantly amongst males and smokers. Risk factors for Mr. Doe include advanced age  male sex  previous smoking habits  a history of high blood pressure and cholesterol  and his father's history of AAA. His back pain and other symptoms align with the clinical features of AAA  typically caused by the aneurysm pressing on surrounding structures. In some studies  the demographic pattern in the occurrence of the disease has been linked to age  race  and family history of the disease  thus it would be important to address the potential genetic susceptibility  lifestyle  and co-morbidity influences. AAA rupture is a significant cause of mortality  which makes early diagnosis and management essential. This case should form part of a comprehensive training material for medical students providing relevant insights into demographics  history taking  symptom presentation  and the importance of physical examination.   This report has sought to align with literature-based evidence to present an accurate representation of a typical patient case with abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,4,Patient Profile Name: Robert D. Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanic Location: San Francisco  California  Previous Medical History Robert has a history of high blood pressure managed with medication  hyperlipidemia and a 30 pack-year tobacco use history. The patient quit smoking ten years ago. His mother suffered from cardiovascular disease and died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaints Robert presented to his general practitioner complaining of intermittent  non-radiating abdominal pain  which has progressively worsened over the past few weeks. He describes the pain as a deep  gnawing feeling in his stomach that seems to intensify after consuming a meal or when laying flat. It sometimes wakes him up at night. He has also noticed an increase in the frequency of urination.   He reported a noticeable weight loss  decreased appetite  and feeling fatigued in the past month. There aren't any associated symptoms like vomiting  changes in bowel movements  fever  or bloating.  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen.   This case report is representative of the typical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm  as most patients are asymptomatic until rupture occurs. When symptoms do occur  they often involve abdominal or back pain and/or a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass  as in this case.   The demographics represented here  including age (greater than 60)  sex (male)  race (Caucasian)  and history of smoking  are all significant risk factors for development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Additionally familial history of AAA also increases the risk. This makes the case extremely educational in displaying the typical AAA patient profile.   It will be important for students to take away the critical nature of early detection and management of these aneurysms to prevent rupture  which carries a high mortality rate.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,5,Case Report for Medical Students:  Patient Demographics:   -  The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2. - He is a retired engineer  a widower  living alone with regular visits from his two grown-up children. - He is a 40 pack year smoker  consuming one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years  but quit smoking 15 years ago.  Past Medical History:  - The patient has a history of moderate hypertension controlled with beta-blockers for the last 15 years.  - He also has hyperlipidemia managed with statin medications. - He had an episode of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) without significant consequences six years back. - He had minimal alcohol intake and no noteworthy allergies.  Key Complaints:  - The patient reports a vague constant lower abdominal pain over the last two days  increasing steadily in severity. - He feels a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. - He denies any associated nausea  vomiting  changes in bowel movements  urological symptoms  chest pain  or fever. - He tells a concerning story of feeling slightly light-headed while walking from his bedroom to the kitchen this morning. - He also reports unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite in the past few months  but no night sweats.  Reason for this Demographic:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm primarily affects men over 65 years  often related to smoking and atherosclerosis. It is more common in Caucasian ethnicity and individuals with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Consequently  an octogenarian with a significant smoking history and vascular comorbidities is a relatively typical representation. The symptomatology illustrated in the case is suggestive though nonspecific; this aims at inciting students to reason diagnostic possibilities and not take symptoms at face value  emphasizing the importance of a complete physical examination for accurate diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,6,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Details: - Name: Mr. Edward White - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Marital Status: Married   Past Medical History: - Continuous smoker for 40 years  recently quit two years back. - Hypertension controlled with medication for the past 10 years. - Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago. - No known allergies. - Family history of cardiovascular disease; father had a myocardial infarction in his mid-sixties.  Key Complaints:  Mr. White presents to the emergency department with lower back pain and abdominal pain that he rates as 8/10 on the pain scale. He describes the pain as severe and steady  having been present for the past 2 days  and not relieved with over-the-counter pain medication.  Note: Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a dilatation of the aorta  most commonly found in the elderly Caucasian males and is highly correlated with a history of smoking and hypertension. It tends to be asymptomatic until rupture  which can lead to a life-threatening situation. In this case  this elderly Caucasian male with a smoking history who presents with severe back and abdominal pain could potentially have an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further assessment must be carried out to confirm this and provide urgent treatment as needed.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,7,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Name: Mr. James Smith Age: 68 Years Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residential Location: Urban Area  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for the past 15 years  on antihypertensives - Ex-smoker  quit smoking 10 years ago after approximately 30 packs per year history - No history of Cardiovascular Diseases  although a family history of AAA in father - No known diabetes or hyperlipidemia  Chief Complaints: - Intermittent  dull pain in the lower back and abdomen for the last 3 months - The pain is non-radiating and does not change with movement or position - Episodes of pain lasting from minutes to hours  with period of respite in-between - Recent unexplained weight loss - No other changes in bowel or bladder habits  Note: The patient profile represents a typical AAA patient. Majority of people diagnosed are males above 65 years with history of smoking and hypertension. Literature suggests that white populations have a higher AAA prevalence compared to other racial and ethnic groups. While most AAA cases are asymptomatic and might be found incidentally  some patients might present with nonspecific symptoms like abdominal or back pain mimicking other common conditions in older adults.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,8,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Robert is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  a retired truck driver living with his wife in a small rural town. He has moderate socioeconomic status  is a former heavy smoker who quit 15 years ago  and has a history of mild alcohol use.  Past Medical History: Robert has a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus - all moderately controlled with medications. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father dying of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture at the age of 72.  Key Complaints: Robert attended his annual check-up with his primary care physician  reporting no specific complaints. However  he expressed concerns about his familial history of AAA. On direct questioning  he reported occasional lower back pain and some vague  mild discomfort in his abdomen  which he attributed to his age and occasional gastritis. Despite downplaying his symptoms  the chronicity and characteristics of the pain roused suspicion.  Narrative: In alignment with the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommendation considering his age  male gender  and history of smoking  Robert underwent an abdominal ultrasound as a preventative screening for AAA. The ultrasound revealed an infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.6 cm.  Clinical Significance: AAAs are most commonly found in Caucasian males  over the age of 65 with a history of smoking. Often asymptomatic  they are usually detected incidentally or during screening for high-risk individuals. Symptoms can vary from abdominal and lower back pain to signs of rupture  which include severe pain and hypotension. The significant risk is aneurysm rupture  which can be life-threatening  hence early detection and appropriate management is vital. This case emphasizes the importance of a sobering clinical history and proactive healthcare in high-risk individuals.    Objective: The purpose of this case is to educate medical students and trainees on the risk factors  symptomatology  screening guidelines  and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms. This training case also illustrates the importance of preventative healthcare  especially in high-risk patients with a significant family history.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,9,Case Summary:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  who is retired and used to work as a firefighter. He is a former smoker with a 40-pack year history  though he quit smoking about 15 years ago. He is a social drinker and denies any substance abuse. He is overweight (BMI 28) but does not follow any regular physical activity.  Past Medical History: Primary hypertension well-controlled on medications. He has a 15-year history of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also underwent an appendectomy in his early 30s and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease two years ago.  Patient Presentation and Key Complaints: The patient came to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe abdominal pain that began suddenly earlier in the day. The pain is not related to meals  no radiation  and has not been changed by any means (e.g.  position change  food intake  etc.). He also reports feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. On further questioning  he also has been feeling mild chronic back pain for a few months but attributed it to his old age.  The patient needs to be evaluated carefully since his age  sex  smoking history  and personal history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and peripheral artery disease put him at a higher risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). According to the literature  Caucasian males over 65 years old who have ever smoked are at a higher risk  with the risk also increasing with age. Plus  the presence of an unspecified abdominal or back pain accompanied by a pulsating sensation could be indicative of AAA  needing a thorough clinical and imaging investigations to rule out a ruptured or impending rupture AAA situation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,10,Case Report: John Doe  a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a history of heavy smoking (30-pack years)  longstanding hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presents to the general physician's office with complaints of vague constant abdominal and lower back pain that has increased in intensity over the past week. The pain is described as a dull ache with intermittent but brief episodes of sudden sharp pains. The patient also complains of moderate unexplained weight loss and decreased appetite over the past couple of months.   John's past medical records reveal poor compliance with his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications. While not diagnosed  John reports symptoms suggestive of claudication with pain in his legs and thighs  especially after walking  indicating possible peripheral artery disease  which he has largely ignored. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  including an elder brother who underwent an operation for abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 70 years. There is no history of any allergies. John is a retired truck driver  widowed  living alone with his pet dog; he reports occasional consumption of alcohol.  The above scenario is representative of the typical risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms  primarily older age  being male  being of Caucasian ethnicity  smoking  hypertension  and a family history of the condition. Suboptimal compliance to medication and potential co-morbidity of peripheral artery disease add additional context and complexity to the case.  The symptoms presented in this case  including unexplained abdominal/back pain  weight loss and decreased appetite  are not directly indicative but are seen in some patients with an advanced abdominal aortic aneurysm. Remember  most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic  and often discovered coincidentally during imaging for other conditions. However  it is also important for medical students to recognize this rare presentation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,11,Patient Case Report:  Name: Mr. John Hamish Age: 66 years old Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer  Past Medical History: Mr. Hamish has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled with antihypertensive medication. He is also a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago but with a 30 pack-year history. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol levels ten years ago  and he has been on statin therapy since. He has a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms as his father died suddenly due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm at age 72.  Present Complaint: Mr. Hamish visited the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset severe abdominal pain for the past 4-5 hours. He described the pain as being in the middle of his abdomen extending towards his back  and rated it as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. He also reported of light-headedness and a sense of 'passing out'.   These findings are indicative of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is at a high risk considering his age  male sex  and family history of AAA. This is also aligned with the demographic data which indicates AAA is most commonly seen in Caucasian men aged over 65 years  who have a history of hypertension  smoking  high cholesterol  and a familial history of the disease.   Additional details: Physical examination  Radiologic investigations (like Ultrasound  CT Scan)  and other diagnostic tests should be carried out to reach a definitive diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,12,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. Harrison - Age: 71 years - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired former truck driver - Insurance: Medicare  Chief Complaint: Mr. Harrison presents complaints of intermittent  persistent abdominal pain radiating to his lower back  with a slight feeling of fullness. He describes the pain as a deep  boring pain that doesn't change with positioning. Initially dismissed the discomfort as potential indigestion or age-related issues  but it has progressively worsened over the last month.  Past Medical History: Mr. Harrison has been previously diagnosed with hypertension  which he manages with a calcium channel blocker (Norvasc). He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which he takes statins. He smoked heavily for 30 years but quit 10 years ago.   Family History: His father died of a heart attack at 67 years and his brother had a stroke at the age of 72. Neither parent nor siblings had a history of aneurysm.  He lives by himself since his wife passed away 2 years ago. They have 2 adult children residing in different cities. Limited physical activity; walks his dog daily for exercise.  Review of Systems: - General: Febrile  but denies recent weight loss - Cardiovascular: Occasional tachycardia  no murmurs - Respiratory: No cough  wheeze  or shortness of breath - Gastrointestinal: No nausea  vomiting  or change in bowel habits - Genitourinary: No change in urinary habits - Musculoskeletal: Lower back pain along with abdominal pain - Neurological: No weakness or numbness in extremities  no difficulty with balance  Conclusion:  Given the history of smoking  hypertension  age and the symptoms - the differential should include abdominal aortic aneurysm. This case is designed to reflect the demographic (older  male  Caucasian) which is most commonly affected by AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm)  as well as common risk factors such as history of smoking and hypertension.  Next steps involve further investigation to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and  if confirmed  evaluate the size and risk of rupture. This case provides an opportunity to discuss the management of the condition  the role of patient lifestyle modification  and potential surgical treatments.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,13,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a height of 5'11"""" and a weight of 210 pounds. He is a retired truck driver and lives with his wife in a rural area. He has been a two-pack a day smoker for the past 45 years.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been prescribed antihypertensive medication (lisinopril) and a statin (atorvastatin) respectively. He struggles with compliance and regularly forgets to take his medication. He reports minimal physical activity and a diet high in fat and low in vegetables. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a heart attack at age 62.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe pain in the lower abdomen and lower back that began while having dinner. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and feels it radiating down to his groin. Along with this  he reported feelings of light-headedness  a rapid heart rate  and clammy skin. He denied any nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  urinary symptoms or trauma to the area. His wife noted that he looked pale and seemed more fatigued than usual.  Assessment: Mr. Smith vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 155/92 mm Hg  heart rate 112 beats per minute  respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute  temperature 37.5'C  and oxygen saturation 96%.  Notes for Education: This case was chosen due to the high incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in Caucasian males above 65 years of age  notably those with a smoking history and hypertension. Clinical manifestations of an abdominal aortic aneurysm often include sudden onset severe pain  hypovolemic shock due to rupture  or incidental findings in an imaging study. Immediate surgical intervention becomes necessary when an AAA ruptures. Signs of free rupture include severe back or abdominal pain that radiates to the groin  signs of shock  and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Symptoms of contained rupture are similar but can also include a vague or throbbing abdominal or flank pain. Therefore  in the presence of high clinical suspicion  patients such as Mr. Smith should be immediately evaluated via ultrasound or CT."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,14,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:   Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  married with three children  presented to the clinic. He is a former smoker (stopped 10 years ago after a 30 pack-year history) and drinks alcohol socially.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of mild hypertension  for which he is currently taking amlodipine. He regularly visits the clinic for check-ups  the last one being six months ago. Also  there is a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father died of an AAA rupture at age 72.  Key Complaints:  Over the past few weeks  he has been experiencing recurrent episodes of dull  radiating pain in the lower back and abdominal area. Additionally  he has felt an unusual pulsating sensation in his abdomen  which prompted his visit. He denies any changes in eating habits  bowel movements  traumatic injury  or urinary complaints. His wife has noticed that he has been more fatigued than usual.  Review of this case is critical as AAA often remains asymptomatic until rupture. Prevalence of AAA is highest in older Caucasian male individuals  especially those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and family history of the disease. This case is designed to give students an update on the potentially fatal vascular condition  highlighting the necessity for early recognition and management  particularly in high-risk demographics as noted in literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,15,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retiree  residing in an urban setting. The patient's primary language is English. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but had a 30-year history of smoking two packs a day.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  moderately managed with medication. He has hyperlipidemia treated with statins. He also suffers from mild obesity (BMI=30.5). His father died of an aortic aneurysm at 75 years old.  Chief complaints: Mr. Doe presents with intermittent abdominal pain over the last week  describing it as a deep  gnawing pain that does not radiate elsewhere. He also reports occasional lower back pain and a sensation of fullness in his abdomen. He denies any recent changes in bowel habits  weight loss  or changes in appetite. He mentions feeling slightly lightheaded on a couple of occasions but hasn't faced any fainting episode.  These demographics and history are consistent with literature stating abdominal aortic aneurysm predominantly affects older males and is associated with factors such as smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of aortic aneurysms. Being a former smoker and having hypertension and hyperlipidemia put Mr. Doe in a high-risk category. He also has a significant family history with his father's sudden death due to an aortic aneurysm.  This vignette offers medical trainees the opportunity to explore potential differential diagnoses  including  but not limited to  abdominal aortic aneurysm - which requires immediate attention considering his clinical history and presentation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,16,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient initials: J.M. Age: 72 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian/White  Occupation: Retired Past medical history: Smoker  uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of peripheral arterial disease Family history: Father died due to ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  Chief complaints: J.M.  an elderly Caucasian male  presents with vague abdominal pain that he has been noticing for the past 3 months. The pain is episodic  located in the lower back region  and often radiates to his groin. He also reports an occasional sensation of fullness in the lower abdomen. J.M. further complaints that he has lost about 10lbs in the last 2 months without attempting to. He remarks that he is a long-term smoker and that he experiences persistent uncontrolled hypertension despite regular medication. J.M. gives a history of peripheral arterial disease and has a familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysm which led to his father's death.   This case represents a classic presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Predominantly  it affects the elderly male population  particularly those with risk factors such as smoking and uncontrolled hypertension. Asserting the importance of this fact  abdominal aortic aneurysm is the 13th leading cause of death in the U.S. among men aged 55 and older. The patient's familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysm increases his risk  emphasizing the need for regular screening and evaluation in such cases.   Objective: The trainee should be able to identify the symptoms and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm  suggest relevant investigations  and plan an appropriate course of treatment in consultation with a vascular surgeon.   Critical thinking and problem-solving skills should be employed to evaluate the aggravated risk factor due to his familial history  and the role of smoking cessation  blood pressure control  and statin therapy in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm should be emphasized. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,17,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information Name: John Doe Age: 70 years  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer Source of referral: Self-referred  History Past Medical History: Hypertension for which he has been taking antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  under control with oral antidiabetic medication. History of tobacco use  although he quit smoking 15 years ago.  Family History: Father died of myocardial infarction in his 60s.   Presenting Complaint John Doe presents with a history of intermittent  dull abdominal pain for the past few weeks  which he initially thought to be due to gastritis. Moreover  he experienced sudden  sharp lower back pain going into his groin today  prompting him to visit the hospital.   Reasons for Representation Data shows that Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  while it can occur in both genders  are most commonly found in males  particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity  like John Doe. Older age is also a risk factor  making a 70-year-old a fitting demographic. John's past medical history factors such as hypertension and a history of smoking are notable risk factors for AAA. His complaint of a dull abdominal pain progressing into severe back pain is indicative of a potentially rupturing AAA  a surgical emergency.   Take Home Message for the Students Abdominal aortic aneurysm may exhibit no symptoms until it's nearly ruptured. Therefore  it's important to consider it in the differential diagnoses in elderly male patients  particularly Caucasians  presenting with abdominal or back pain. Risk factors such as age  male sex  hypertension  smoking history  and atherosclerosis can predispose patients to AAA. It's crucial to promptly evaluate and manage these patients to prevent life-threatening complications.   *This case is designed for educational purposes and does not represent a specific real-life patient. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,18,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Martin Harper  a 70-year-old Caucasoid male (since AAAs are more common among white males)  retired construction worker  is a lifelong smoker with a pack-a-day habit. Mr. Harper lives with his wife in the suburbs. He has two sons who live in different cities and doesn't have any access to genetic records noting the health of his paternal side ancestors.  Past Medical History: Mr. Harper has a history of untreated hypertension. He was diagnosed with high blood pressure 9 years ago and initially used to take medications  but discontinued them after a few years when he felt """"perfectly fine."""" He is also a long-term smoker  with 35 pack-years of tobacco use. He has a history of high cholesterol and a familial history of vascular diseases (a brother had an AAA repair). However  there is no known family history of genetic connective tissue disorders  such as Marfan's or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Key Complaints: Mr. Harper visits the family physician complaining of a dull  constant pain in the middle or lower part of his abdomen for the past two weeks. Occasionally  he feels the pain radiating to his back as well causing discomfort along with a sensation of fullness. He denies any symptoms of chest pain  severe low back pain  syncopal episodes  testicular pain  or urinary symptoms. He also mentions that he has been feeling slightly fatigued lately but attributes it to his age and less active lifestyle.  Summary Narrative: Our patient  Mr. Harper  a 70-year-old lifelong smoker with untreated hypertension  represents a demographic that is at an increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). These typical risk factors combined with the fact that he has a brother who had an AAA repair and his presentation of persistent abdominal pain warrants screening for AAA.   From this case  students should learn to question patients about change in bowel habits  weight loss  ureteric colic or any history indicating rupture such as sudden sharp pain  signs of shock  etc. Urgency should be recognized to either order imaging right away or fast-track a referral to vascular surgery if there's clinical suspicion of AAA. These steps could potentially save the patient from catastrophic outcomes related to AAA rupture. Lesson learned: Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving AAA-related mortality."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,19,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. J. Brown is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department.  Past Medical History: Patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been a chain smoker for the past 40 years. Patient underwent an appendectomy at the age of 32 and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 55. He does not exercise regularly. He is currently on antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs  along with regular insulin.  Chief Complaints: Patient reports a sudden unrelenting sharp pain in his lower back and abdomen  which started about 6 hours ago. He also reports feeling weak and dizzy with associated nausea and vomiting. Patient mentions a rapid beating sensation in his abdomen  with associated shortness of breath.  Note: Evidence-based data shows that abdominal aortic aneurysms overwhelmingly occur in males over the age of 65  particularly among those with risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  lack of physical activity  and family history of aortic aneurysm. The abrupt onset of pain in the back or abdomen along with symptoms of shock  may indicate a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  a condition requiring immediate medical intervention.  Having Mr. Brown as a patient would aid medical students in recognizing the risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm and understanding the dire consequences of a rupture. The students can also learn to recognize the symptoms and understand the urgency of the situation  which can often mean the difference between life and death. They will learn to effectively communicate with the patient  providing reassurance while realizing the need for immediate intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,20,Case Report:  Patient: Mr. Robert Campbell  Demographics: 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired schoolteacher  living with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Campbell has a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and is a former smoker (stopped 25 years ago). His father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 63.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Campbell visits the clinic with complaints of a constant  severe lower abdominal pain for the last two days. It's not associated with meals  bowel movements or physical activities. Additionally  he reports a perceptible pulsating feeling in the abdomen. His wife noticed a slight change in his gait and reported that he seems a bit slower and weaker than usual.  Possible reason to suspect Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm:  Mr. Campbell’s presenting complaints  advanced age  history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm place him at high risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His current complaints of severe abdominal pain and a pulsating feeling could indicate a rapidly growing or rupturing aneurysm  which is a medical emergency.  Learning Objectives:   Through this case  students should learn and be able to discuss: - The typical demographic and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. - How to identify the signs and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  including a possible rupture. - The significance of early detection and treatment strategies for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms given the high fatality rate of ruptured aneurysms. - The importance of asking about family history with regard to cardiovascular disease  specifically aortic aneurysms. - How to initiate a prompt diagnostic workup for suspected cases (ultrasound  abdominal CT). - The potential complications  surgical management  and postoperative care of patients who have abdominal aortic aneurysms.   This case is oriented towards being simple yet instructive  and to help students highlight the connection between epidemiologic factors  clinical history  and abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosis. The importance of multidisciplinary patient care  including anesthesia and surgical teams  should also be highlighted.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,21,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information:  Edward Schultz is a 69-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban community. He has been a smoker for the past 50 years  consuming approximately one pack per day. He is a retired construction worker and now leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle. He lives with his wife and has three adult children. He consumes alcohol moderately  up to seven drinks per week.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Schultz has a history of hypertension which has been fairly well-controlled with lisinopril. His last recorded BP was 135/85 mmHg about a month ago. He has been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and prescribed statin therapy 5 years ago  although he is inconsistent in compliance. He is also known to have peripheral artery disease. Due to his prolonged smoking history  he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and uses an albuterol inhaler as needed.  Reason for Visit/Key Complaints:  Mr. Schultz presents with complaints of a visible and palpable pulsating mass in his abdomen coupled with occasional  dull lower back pain which he first noticed a week back. He denies any severe or recent trauma  fever  weight loss or changes in bowel and urinary habits. On further inquiry  he admits intermittent claudication that he attributes to his age and COPD. His family history reveals his father died suddenly at age 73 due to what was suspected to be an """"abdominal artery rupture.""""  Physical exam:  A pulsatile mass is palpated in Mr. Schultz's abdomen. Peripheral pulses are reduced  and he has cool extremities with signs of peripheral neuropathy.  Preliminary Assessment:  Given the patient's age  strong smoking history  the presence of concurrent vascular diseases  and recent complaints  this case points towards an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The next clinical step would involve sonography or computed tomography for diagnostic confirmation. Further management would depend on aneurysm size and rate of growth. This case is to guide students into a deeper understanding of the AAA risk factors  diagnostic procedures  management options  and possible complications."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,22,Patient Information:  - Name: Mr. Smith - Age: 72 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History:  - Former smoker  quit 20 years ago with a total pack-year history of 20 - Hypertension maintained with antihypertensive medication - Moderate alcohol consumption  Chief Complaint:   - Episodic abdominal pain for the past two weeks. Initially dull but intensified over the past 72 hours - Pain has a duration of a few hours each day  and gets relieved by bending forward  - Associated lower back discomfort - No apparent triggers  no relieving factors identified - Occasional dizziness and nausea  but no vomiting or change in bowel movement.  Clinical Case Summary:  Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and smoking  presents for the evaluation of recent onset episodic abdominal pain that has been occurring for two weeks. The pain is moderate to severe and is somewhat alleviated with bending forward but is otherwise unrelieved. The pain has been on and off but has increased in severity over the past 72 hours. He also complains of occasional dizziness and nausea but denies vomiting  or any changes in bowel or bladder function.  Considering his medical history and age  the clinical suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is decently high. Current smoking and being a male over the age of 65 increases his risk. His hypertension could have facilitated the development and enlargement of an aneurysm. Thus  a thorough diagnosis that includes an abdominal examination and confirmatory imaging tests should be carried out to establish the presence of an AAA and to determine the necessary treatment protocol.  Note: This is a brief case outline and the learner's guide should delve into the dedicated discussion about AAA  its pathophysiology  epidemiology  diagnosis  management  including when to opt for surgery  and postoperative care. Prompt recognition and management of AAA are crucial considering the high mortality associated with ruptured AAA.   Educational Objectives:  1. Identify the risk factors and clinical presentations of AAA. 2. Understand the importance of a timely diagnosis and the role of imaging studies in AAA. 3. Discuss the management and follow-up protocol for patients with AAA.  4. Highlight the potential complications of untreated  large or ruptured AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,23,Case Study: Mr. Edward  66-year-old Caucasian Male with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Background: Mr. James Edward is a 66-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban background. He is married with three grown-up children. He has a 35-year history of smoking  though he has managed to cut down to 5 cigarettes a day from a pack a day over the course of 15 years. He has been diagnosed with hypertension for 10 years  for which he takes Lisinopril. He also has a family history of cardiac diseases  with his father passing away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 71. He has shown mild hyperlipidemia  which is managed through diet control. The patient denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. 	 Presenting Complaints: Mr. Edward presented at the clinic complaining of a persistent  mild abdominal pain for the past few weeks. He described it as a ‘gurgling sensation’ located near his navel that sometimes extends to his back. Furthermore  he has also experienced an unintentional weight loss of nearly 10 pounds in the past two months even though his appetite has remained relatively unchanged.   According to epidemiological data  Mr. Edward's demographic (age  sex  race) together with his past medical history – particularly his history of hypertension and smoking – make him a high-risk candidate for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,24,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Vito Russo Age: 73 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired- Army Veteran Marital Status: Divorced Living Situation: Lives alone in a two-bedroom apartment Insurance Status: Medicare  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for 12 years  well-controlled using Amlodipine  2. Hyperlipidaemia controlled with Atorvastatin. 3. 50-pack year smoking history  currently reduced to 5 cigarettes a day 4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago  managed with Metformin 5. Mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  not on oxygen therapy 6. Preventive AAA screening 3 years ago reveals 3.2 cm aortic diameter.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Russo presents to his primary care physician's office during a routine visit. He does not have any complaint of any symptoms but was feeling a bit tired. On detailed interrogation  he does recount some intermittent  non-radiating low back pain over the past few months which he had attributed to his age and physical exertion during workout. He reports feeling of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen occasionally but no issues with eating or any change in bowel habits. Recently  during an at-home blood pressure monitoring  he observed a dip in his systolic blood pressure readings without any alterations in his regular medication schedule.  Physical Examination Findings: On examination  a pulsatile mass of about 6cm was palpated in his abdomen and a bruit was auscultated over it. No lower extremity edemas were noted. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable with no abnormal cardiac sounds or lung sounds. His blood pressure reading in the office was 135/80 mm Hg and heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  The demographics  past medical history  and patient profile are chosen as per pertinent literature which state that high-risk individuals for AAA include older age group  males  smokers  people with hypertension or history of cardiovascular diseases and Caucasian race. Furthermore  AAAs are often asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally or during routine screening of high-risk individuals  similar to the scenario painted in Mr. Russo's case.   This interactive case would help inform medical students about risk factors of AAA  how its presentation might be silent or disguised as low back pain  the importance of physical examination and reflective on the need for appropriate screening measures within high-risk populations. After interactive discussion  the students can be guided to discuss further diagnostic work-up and management strategies for Mr. Russo. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,25,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male with a history of military service. He is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago and continues to consume alcohol moderately. He works as a retired engineer and leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle. The patient is overweight with a BMI of 28  and lives in urban surroundings.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and intermittent claudication indicative of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He has had no surgical interventions in the past. His father succumbed to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 75  indicating a family history.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reports a recent onset of intermittent  mild-to-moderate abdominal pain that he describes as a deep  gnawing sensation  localized to the lower back. He has also reported unintentional weight loss over the past few months. Further  he reports episodes of feeling faint and dizziness after brief periods of physical exertion  which are recent phenomena.  This case targets several key risk factors including old age  male gender  African American race  former smoker  hypertension  high cholesterol  family history of AAA  peripheral arterial disease  and symptoms such as abdominal pain or back pain that labor on AAA. As literature suggests that AAAs are most common in older white men with a smoking history  introducing an African American patient adds an additional layer for discussion regarding potential race-related diagnostic disparities and biases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,26,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics:  The patient  Mr. Alvarez  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of heavy smoking. He is a retired construction worker  residing in a suburban setting  married with three adult children  and weighs 215 pounds. He is of average height for his age and reports occasional alcohol use.  Past medical history: Mr. Alvarez has been known to hypertension for over 10 years  poorly controlled with amlodipine and lisinopril. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and is taking metformin  but his glycemic control has been suboptimal with his most recent HbA1c at 8.2%. He has an extensive history of tobacco use  smoking 1.5 packs a day for 40 years though he ceased smoking 10 years back. Additionally  he has been treated for hypercholesterolemia and peripheral vascular disease. He has no known drug allergies. In his surgical history  he underwent a right hip replacement two years ago.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Alvarez visited the clinic with complaints of intermittent  dull abdominal pain that worsens after meals. The pain has been ongoing over a week and radiated to his lower back. Upon further questioning  Mr. Alvarez also noted unintentional weight loss of around 10 pounds over the last two months  low appetite  and fatigue. He also acknowledged that he felt a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  which prompted him to seek medical attention.  Note: This case has taken into consideration the common risk factors associated with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  including age (most commonly affects people aged 65-75)  gender (more common in men)  race (more common in white people)  smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerosis. Unexplained weight loss  though not a common symptom of AAA  may suggest secondary complications or other underlying pathologies. As per the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations  patients like Mr. Alvarez with a history of smoking should be screened for AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,27,Patient Profile:   Name: John Doe Age: 70 years old  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer Location: Urban  Past Medical History:  - John has a 40-year history of smoking  though he quit 10 years ago.  - He has controlled hypertension and a known history of peripheral vascular disease.  - His father passed away in his 80s due to ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Key Complaints:   - John presents to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen  that started couple hours ago.  - He describes it as a tearing sensation  that is worsening with time.  - He is simultaneously experiencing nausea and mild shortness of breath.  - His vital signs are stable; however  a noticeable pulsating mass is felt upon physical examination of his abdomen.   The above case represents a classic presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient's demographics like age  gender and race  his past medical history including smoking  hypertension and family history of AAA  and his clinical presentation with sudden abdominal and lower back pain  make it highly suggestive of AAA. It is also consistent with literature  where the AAA mostly affects Caucasian males aged 65-75 years  who are smokers or have a history of smoking  with medical comorbidities like hypertension and family history of AAA. The condition is also more prevalent in urban populations. The case is also designed to emphasize the emergency nature of a possible ruptured AAA  hence the setting of an Emergency Department.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,28,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics: Mr. James Rooney is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  a retired truck driver residing in a suburban area. He is a widower with two adult children. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for about 45 years but has quit smoking for the past 5 years or so. He maintains a moderate alcohol intake and admits to a diet rich in red meat and high in fats.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rooney has a well-documented past medical history which includes Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). His family history reveals his late father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His medications include amlodipine for hypertension  atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and salmeterol for COPD.  Key Complaints: Over several weeks  Mr. Rooney has been experiencing vague  intermittent abdominal and lower back pain that tends to get worse after meals. He also mentions a feeling of pulsation in his stomach  which made him lose his appetite gradually. He initially attributed these symptoms to age and indigestion but decided to seek medical attention when the pain intensified  and he noticed unintentional weight loss  which has left him feeling worried.  This case was designed to represent a typical patient demographic predisposed to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  a condition most often found in males over 65 years old  smokers  Caucasian  those with a family history of AAA  hypertensive  hyperlipidemia  and COPD patients. The chief complaints are also consistent with early-stage AAA  and allow room for educators to explain appropriate responses and diagnostic approaches.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,29,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  Mr. Jones  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  comes in for a routine physical. He is a widower and a retired auto mechanic. He now occupies his time with gardening and occasional golf.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has been a smoker for the past 50 years  consuming approximately a pack a day. Although currently doesn’t report any signs of respiratory distress  he’s been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also has a history of hypertension adequately controlled with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Key Complaints:  During the visit  Mr. Jones mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent abdominal discomfort for the last few weeks. The pain is not severe but is notable by its unfamiliarity. He notes that the pain happens mostly after a meal and seems to be unrelated to particular foods. He adds there's also discomfort at his lower back that he attributes to overexertion from his gardening activities.  Additional Information:  Mr. Jones is slightly overweight  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 but denies any changes in appetite  bowel habit  weight loss  dysuria  or hematuria. His pulse rate is regular but there's a noticeable pulsatile mass near the umbilical area.  This case presentation should stimulate your students to think about the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Mr. Jones's age  male sex  history of smoking  and hypertension are all risk factors. His complaint of vague abdominal and lower back pain  coupled with the physical finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass  should raise suspicions for AAA. However  his symptoms could also result from other conditions  such as peptic ulcer disease or musculoskeletal back strain  requiring a differential diagnosis approach. Importantly  his COPD also poses additional risks during monitoring and possible operative interventions  signifying the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation in managing patients with AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,30,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department. He is a retired Marine Engineer  a non-smoker but drinks alcohol moderately. His BMI falls within the overweight range. He lives with his wife in a suburban community.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  for which he is taking Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol 5 years ago  and is on Lipitor (Atorvastatin) therapy. The patient reports regular compliance with the prescribed medications. There is no history of diabetes or kidney ailments. He had appendectomy at age 20  no other surgeries are reported. Family history includes a brother who died at age 63 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith reports a sudden onset of severe  tearing abdominal pain that started a couple of hours ago  accompanied by back pain. He is experiencing mild dizziness  but denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness. Moreover  he mentions of having reduced appetite and unintended weight loss over the past few months.   The age  gender  and medical history of the patient aligns with demographic groups at increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms  as suggested by multiple studies. Males aged over 60 with history of smoking  high blood pressure  high cholesterol levels and family history of AAA are proven to be at higher risk.   The acute  severe abdominal and back pain reported  coupled with recent symptoms like reduced appetite and weight loss might point to an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However  further diagnosis is required to confirm this hypothesis. Following the clinical presentation  you should order an abdominal examination  blood work and an abdominal ultrasound. The subsequent steps towards management should be pursued based on the results obtained. Be sure to take time to talk with the patient and his partner  explaining clearly the situation and the planned diagnostic steps.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,31,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Thomas Banks  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired mechanical engineer  long-term resident of Boston  Massachusetts.  Past Medical History:  The patient is a known hypertensive for the last 12 years  controlled with regular medications (amlodipine 5mg once daily). He is a former 30-pack year smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has no known allergies. Family history includes a father who died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at age 73 along with a younger brother who also had a non-ruptured AAA discovered incidentally during an imaging test for kidney stones.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Banks  who generally enjoys good health  came for a routine follow-up appointment. He mentioned intermittent episodes of vague abdominal pain that he had been experiencing in the past couple of months. He described the pain as non-radiating  without any associated symptoms like nausea or vomiting. However  he noticed the pain becomes more noticeable after his daily evening meals. The pain is not severe  but it is unfamiliar to him  which induced the concern. More recently  he noticed a pulsatile mass in his abdomen which he described as a “heartbeat in my belly”. Further  he mentioned unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds (4.5 kgs) during the last three months  suggesting possible anorexia. He denied any changes in his bowel movements or urine output.   Note:  The demographic representation in this case aligns with literature  targeting a person who is male  over 65  a former smoker  hypertensive  and having a familial predisposition - all of which are primary risk factors associated with the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Further  the presented symptoms  especially the pulsatile mass in the abdomen and unexplained abdominal pain  push the suspicion towards an AAA. This case emphasizes the importance of taking a proper familial history and correlating the non-specific symptoms to the risk profile of the patients. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,32,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  Mr. James Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male retired construction worker. He lives alone and has been a lifetime smoker  consuming approximately one pack per day. He also admits frequent intake of alcohol but denies any illegal substance use. He has a significant family history  with his father passing away from an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) rupture at the age of 65.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago and Type II diabetes mellitus 15 years ago. Other medical conditions include high cholesterol and mild COPD. His surgical history includes an appendectomy in his early 20s and bilateral knee replacements five years ago. He is currently on amlodipine  lisinopril  metformin  and simvastatin.  Chief Complaints:  The patient presents with a sudden onset  severe abdominal pain which started around 3 hours prior to arrival. The pain radiates to the lower back  and he describes it as a tearing sensation. He denies any nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness. He also notes recent unexplained weight loss but doesn't have any noticeable decrease in appetite.  Upon initial evaluation  the patient is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 170/85 mmHg  heart rate 100 bpm  oxygen saturation 95% on room air  and respirations 16 per minute. The clinician feels a pulsatile mass in the mid to lower abdomen. Lab tests and further imaging will need to be done to confirm the diagnosis of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.  This case is representative of typical AAA patients  as literature shows a higher incidence in males over 65  especially those of Caucasian ethnicity. It is associated with a history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of AAA. Type II diabetes has a unique inverse correlation  shown to decrease the risk of AAA  but in this case  Mr. Thompson still developed one due to other prominent risk factors. His complaint of severe abdominal pain radiating to his back is classic for AAA rupture. A pulsatile abdominal mass is also a key physical finding.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,33,Patient Case: Mr. John Gray   Demographics: Mr. John Gray is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a recently retired civil engineer who lives with his wife in Miami  Florida. He is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but he reports a 30-pack year history of smoking. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit substances. He has a BMI of 29 indicating overweight.  Past Medical History: Mr. Gray has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Both conditions are reasonably well-controlled with medications; he currently takes a diuretic for his hypertension and a statin for his hyperlipidemia respectively. Mr. Gray also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 73.  Chief Complaints: Over the past two weeks  Mr. Gray has been experiencing intermittent and vague abdominal discomfort. The pain is not sharp or severe but consistent enough to cause him to seek medical attention. He notes the discomfort seems to concentrate in his abdominal region  more in the center around his navel and sometimes radiates to his back. The pain does not increase with food intake or defecation. He denied any changes in his bowel habits  nausea  vomiting  fevers  or any other associated symptoms.  This case is designed to provide a classic presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The age  gender  smoking history  and hypertension are all particularly significant as they play into the risks associated with the development of AAA. Abdominal discomfort and back pain are clinical manifestations  though it should be noted that many cases of AAA are asymptomatic until rupture. After presentation of this case  students should be able to recognize the potential signs and risks of AAA and consider it in their differential diagnoses.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,34,Case Report   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer. He reports a smoking history of 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He lives in a suburban environment with his wife. He occasionally consumes alcohol.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his smoking history. His father died due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 75 years.   Present Complaint:  The patient reported intermittent and moderate to severe abdominal pain that also spreads to his lower back. The pain is not associated with food intake and was described as a deep  gnawing sensation  which occasionally exacerbates to a sharp sensation. He has had three episodes of such pain in the last week  each lasting for a few hours. The pain subsides when he lies down and worsens upon activity. He also expresses mild shortness of breath on mild exertion  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss over recent weeks.   Note: We have designed this case keeping in mind that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are most commonly found in males over the age of 65 with a history of smoking and hypertension. The Caucasian race  COPD and family history of AAA are also risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,35,Patient Case:   Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. John Smith - Age: 72 Years Old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Construction Worker - Marital Status: Married  with three grown children  Medical History: - Hypertension (well-controlled with Lisinopril) - Smoking: 40 pack-years  quit 10 years ago - High Cholesterol: Statin-controlled - Previous history of peripheral artery disease   Key Complaints: - Recurrent mild abdominal pain for the past three weeks - Mild lower back discomfort - Occasional episodes of feeling light-headed - Reported one instance of fainting a week ago - No report of drastic weight loss or weight gain  The above demographics and medical history are consistent with the most common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm  as per the literature. These include advanced age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  and previous history of peripheral artery disease--all of which our example patient  Mr. Smith  has. Caucasian men over the age of 65 with a history of smoking and hypertension form a significant proportion of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. The key complaints also align with frequent symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  including recurrent mild to moderate abdominal or lower back pain  feeling light-headed  and occasional fainting. However  these symptoms might not always be present in all individuals  as significant proportion of abdominal aortic aneurysm cases are found incidentally when imaging is done for unrelated reasons.   This case study can be utilized to teach medical students about the aspects of risk stratification  early recognition  assessment  and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm. It may further prompt discussions about the importance of routine screening in high-risk individuals  especially considering the potentially severe complications of an unattended abdominal aortic aneurysm  such as rupture leading to life-threatening hemorrhage.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,36,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Mr. Wilson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who currently resides in the urban area. He is a former manual laborer but now retired. He is a heavy smoker with a 50-pack year history and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Past Medical History: Mr. Wilson has a known medical history of high blood pressure  high cholesterol  and peripheral artery disease  all of which he takes medications for. Despite being advised to quit smoking  the patient has not changed his smoking habits. He has been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  which is managed with a combination of medications including inhaled corticosteroids  bronchodilators and occasional courses of oral steroids during exacerbations.   Key Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset epigastric pain  which he describes as a ripping or tearing sensation that radiates through to his back. He also complained about feeling faint and having a """"fast  faint pulse.” Over the last few months  he has experienced unexplained weight loss  occasional shortness of breath and intermittent claudication.   Background Information: The demographics and clinical history point towards a potential abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA tends to affect older males and is particularly prevalent in smokers and those with a history of cardiovascular disease. Caucasians are the most affected demographic group as compared to other ethnicities. The sudden onset of severe pain is a classic symptom of ruptured AAA  which is a medical emergency due to significant risk of death from hemorrhage.  Further investigation such as a physical examination (palpating an abdominal mass)  imaging like ultrasound or CT  and hemodynamic management will be the next decisive steps.   The provided case can be used to impart knowledge regarding clinical presentation  risk factors  appropriate investigations  and management of AAA. The case can pave the foundation for a detailed discussion about the pathophysiology behind AAA  the reasoning behind various diagnostic tools  and possible surgical or conservative treatment options that provide best patient care."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,37,Patient Profile - Name: John Doe Age: 72 years Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Army official  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe comes into the ER complaining of severe and constant pain in the lower back and abdominal area which he has described as a pulsating sensation  deep within his abdomen. He also reports bouts of nausea and feelings of lightheadedness.   Medical History: Mr. Doe has been a smoker for approximately 40 years and has a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) which is controlled by medication. He's had episodes of increased cholesterol levels in the past and was on lipid-lowering drugs till two years back. There is no apparent history of diabetes. His father had suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 76.  Physical Examination: On examination  a pulsatile mass is felt in the abdomen while his vital signs are within normal limits. However  he looks distressed due to immense pain.  Considerations for Case Discussion:   This patient case has been designed to reflect the typical high-risk demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Studies indicate that the incidence rates of AAA are higher in males  and the risk increases with age  particularly in those over 65. Smoking is also a known significant risk factor for AAA. Furthermore  individuals with a family history of AAA are also at increased risk  hence this history has been added to our patient's profile.   This case is prepared to engage student discussion around the identification  differential diagnoses  risk factors  immediate management  and treatment options for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in an urgent vascular emergency as this should be a focus during training.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,38,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Miguel Fernandez  an 68-year-old Hispanic male  Past Medical History: He has a history of diagnosed hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for the past 15 years. He's a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history and quit smoking 10 years ago. He has no history of surgeries or major illnesses. He reports moderate alcohol consumption but denies illicit drug use.  Key Complaints: Over the past week  Mr. Fernandez reports experiencing an unusual consistent pain in his middle and lower abdomen which he describes as a deep ache. He begins to worry as this pain felt different from his usual indigestion. Some episodes of sharp pain are superimposed on this dull ache especially when he is active. The pain is not related to food intake  and there have been no accompanying symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or change in bowel habits. He reports an unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the last 3 months. He also mentions the recent onset of lower back pain  without radiating aspects. He has not noticed any pulsatile abdominal mass.  This case design is constructed to reflect the common risk factors and presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). According to literature  AAA often occurs in older adults  especially males over 65 years of age. It also often occurs more frequently in the Hispanic population. Hypertension  high cholesterol level  smoking  and age are considerable risk factors. The gradual onset of abdominal and back pain imply the slow expansion of the aortic aneurysm. Furthermore  AAA is often asymptomatic until it is on the verge of rupturing  thus  it's crucial for medical students to understand the subtle presentation like loss of weight.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,39,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile  James is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired construction worker and current smoker with a 45-pack-year smoking history. He reports moderate alcohol use. He is 6'0"""" tall  weighs 200 pounds  and has a relatively sedentary lifestyle.   Past Medical History  James has a medical history of systemic hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed by regular medication. His familial history reveals his father died of a rupture of an aortic aneurysm at age 70.  Presenting Complaints   James presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  acute onset abdominal and back pain that had been escalating over the past couple of hours. The pain was persistent and James described it as a tearing sensation extending to the groin. He also reported feeling dizzy and experiencing a rapid heartbeat.  Emergency Examination   On initial examination  James appeared anxious and pale. Vital signs demonstrated tachycardia but blood pressure was within normal margins. On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in the abdominal area. Further examination results are pending an ultrasound and/or CT scan.  Demographics Considerations   This case aligns with typical demographic reports from literature that shows abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) occur more commonly in men  particularly Caucasian men  over the age of 65 (Guirguis-Blake et al.  2014). Other risk factors often associated with AAA include hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and a family history of the condition. In fact  smoking is considered the strongest risk factor  especially with a history of over 35-40 pack-years (Kent et al.  2010).   References:  Guirguis-Blake  J. M.  Beil  T. L.  Sun  X.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,40,Case study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:   John is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who resides in a rural part of North Carolina. He is married and has three adult children. John is a retired miner and veteran.   Past medical history:  He has a history of 30 years of cigarette smoking but quit seven years ago  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. His father died due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm while his mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes. John has a sedentary lifestyle and an average American diet. Despite these  he has never been hospitalized before.  Presenting complaint:  John arrived in the clinic complaining of a constant abdominal pain that he has been experiencing for the last two weeks. The pain is felt mainly in the central and upper part of his abdomen  which seems to extend to his back. He also mentions experiencing more fatigue than usual during his daily activities and has lost approximately 10 lbs. unintentionally in the past month. He states he has been feeling full quickly when eating and has mild nausea.  This case depicts a common presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The risk factors seen in this case are congruent with the epidemiological evidence  which underscores that AAAs are more prevalent in Caucasian men over 60 years of age with a history of smoking  hypertension  family history of AAA  and cardiovascular disease. Symptoms such as the presence of a pulsating abdominal mass or unexplained weight loss might indicate the presence of an AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,41,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Mr. Richard Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department. He is retired and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history  but reports that he quit smoking around 15 years ago  after his initial diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is not currently on oxygen therapy for COPD. He also has a history of hypertension which is controlled with medication (lisinopril). He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  Past Medical History: - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - No history of diabetes  - He is not on any anticoagulant therapy  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Thompson reports a 2-day history of gradual onset  dull  constant abdominal and back pain that is unrelieved with over-the-counter pain medication. The pain is located in the lower abdomen and back. He also mentions a feeling of fullness in his abdomen which is a new symptom for him. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  lower extremity weakness/numbness or recent changes in bowel or urinary habits.  This case specimen is a typical representation of the demography that abdominal aortic aneurysm would generally affect. Literature suggests that AAAs are most commonly found in older patients with a mean age of 70  more frequently in males than in females  among Caucasians and in smokers or former smokers. Moreover  hypertension and COPD are also risk factors for AAA development. Thus  the patient  Mr. Richard Thompson  realistically represents the typical patient profile for an AAA case. His presenting complaints and past medical history are in line with what would generally raise suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a clinical setting.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,42,Patient Information:   This case involves Mr. Rodriguez  a 70-year-old Hispanic male living in rural New Mexico. He is a retired construction worker with an annual income below the national average.  Demographics: Ethnicity: Hispanic Age: 70 yrs Sex: Male Location: Rural New Mexico  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has led an active life with a history of hypertension and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  likely due to a 30-year pack history of smoking. He quit smoking 5 years ago after the COPD diagnosis. He has no history of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident. Over the past year  he has noticed progressive shortness of breath when walking up the hill to his home. His medications include a low-dose thiazide diuretic and inhaled bronchodilator.  Key Complaints: He came into the primary care clinic complaining of abdominal and lower back pain that he rated as about 6 on a scale from 1 to 10  10 being severe pain. He described it as a throbbing discomfort in his lower abdomen  radiating to his lower back  the severity of which tends to increase after eating meals. There has been no fever  hematuria  recent trauma or lifting heavy objects. He has noticed a bulge in his belly but assumed it was simply related to aging. No changes in appetite  but he has experienced recent weight loss due to reduced food intake because of his fear that eating exacerbates the pain.  Rationale: This case of Mr. Rodriguez is designed around the typical patient demographics for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The condition is most common in males over the age of 60 who have a history of smoking  hypertension  and atherosclerotic disease. The abdominal and back pain described by the patient suggests the possibility of an aneurysm and illustrates the need for a high degree of suspicion in clinical practice among the susceptible population. According to data from the CDC  Hispanic Americans are more at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm than non-Hispanic whites  providing an important consideration for the practice of culturally competent care. The inclusion of low socioeconomic background and rural living area highlights the importance of understanding barriers to healthcare access in certain demographics.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,43,Case Report: Multisystem Involvement with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 72-year-old male of Hispanic descent. He is a retired schoolteacher  married  with three children and six grandchildren. He has lived in the same urban area for the last 48 years and has a 40-pack/year history of smoking  but quit 5 years ago. He partakes in moderate alcohol consumption  drinking an average of 1-2 glasses of red wine daily. He's currently on an aspirin regimen for his heart condition and a statin for high cholesterol.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease  specifically previous myocardial infarction (about 5 years ago)  well-controlled hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He also had Type 2 diabetes  controlled with oral hypoglycemics. There's a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm with his father having it at around the same age.  Key Complaints: The patient initially presented to his primary care physician with a non-specific complaint of abdominal and lower back discomfort that had been progressively worsening over the past few months. Accompanying these complaints was a feeling of fullness in his stomach even when he hadn't eaten much. He also states that his trouser belt  which normally is quite comfortable  has been causing him discomfort. Unexplained weight loss of around 4.5 kg over 6 months has been noted too. Recent bouts of severe stabbing abdominal pain had alarmed him enough to seek advice.  Upon initial examination  a pulsatile mass in the abdomen raised concerns for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The patient was immediately referred for further investigations.  These demographics  past medical history  and key complaints are consistent with the higher risk of AAA found in older males  those with a family history of the condition  and lifestyle factors like a history of smoking. The Hispanic community is currently underrepresented in most cardiovascular health studies but recent data suggest that they may have a risk profile similar to Caucasians. This case hopes to highlight the importance of considering all patient populations when assessing for conditions like AAA.   Furthermore  medical students should take note of the non-specificity of symptoms  which may explain why AAAs are often diagnosed late or missed altogether  emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion and examination.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,44,Case Presentation:  Initial Information:  Patient: Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history. His father reportedly died from 'a massive stroke' in his early 70s. He is currently on a regimen of antihypertensive medications and statin for his cholesterol. He has no history of surgeries or any known drug allergies.   Key Complaints: Mr. Smith presents to the clinic with complaints of an uncharacteristic  gradual onset  dull pain in the lower back and abdominal region over the past two weeks that isn't alleviated with routine over-the-counter analgesics. He also reports general fatigue and unexplained episodes of lightheadedness. No complaints of nausea  vomiting  change in bowel habits  urinary issues  or recent weight loss.   On Physical Examination: Mr. Smith appears mildly distressed. Vital signs are stable; however  his blood pressure is on the higher end. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile epigastric mass with bruit.  Reason Why this Case is Being Used:  This case was chosen to instruct medical students on the clinical presentation  risk factors  physical examination findings  diagnosis  and management strategies associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Due to the strong correlation with aging  smoking  and male gender reported in literature  the patient has been designed to be a 70-year-old man with a significant history of smoking  hypertension  and a family history indicative of vascular issues.  Objectives for Students:  1. Recognize the importance of carefully deciphering past medical histories. 2. Identify risk factors of AAA. 3. Understand the clinical symptoms and physical findings suggestive of AAA. 4. Understand the potential tests used for diagnosing AAA. 5. Become acquainted with the management strategies for AAA  both in emergency and non-emergency settings. 6. Learn about the potential complications of untreated AAA.   (Note: This case is designed for educational purposes and is not about a real patient.)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,45,Case Report   Patient Information: Mr. Jack Arnold  a 68-year-old Caucasian male.   Occupation: Retired teacher.  Past Medical History: Former smoker for 30 years (quit smoking 10 years ago). Patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. No history of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Not known with any allergies.   Key Complaint: Mr. Arnold presents to the emergency department with severe  sudden back pain described as tearing  which started a couple of hours ago. He rate it 9/10 on a pain scale. He does not have any other associated symptoms such as chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting or loss of consciousness. He also reports intermittent abdominal discomfort over the past six months  which he had previously dismissed as digestive problems.  Physical Appraisal: Mr. Arnold's vitals on admission are as follows; blood pressure: 160/90 mmHg  pulse: 110 bpm  temperature: 37.1°C  respiratory rate: 18 bpm and oxygen saturation: 97% on room air. On physical examination  the patient appears to be anxious and in acute distress. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. An abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass in the midline  which is tender on palpation.  Based on real life statistics  an older male with a history of smoking is a typical demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In addition  hypertension  high cholesterol and Caucasian ethnicity are established risk factors for AAA. This case is designed to provide an accurate representation of a potential AAA patient  and assist students in identifying and managing AAA in its early stages to prevent rupturing. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,46,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Mr. Andrew O'Sullivan  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  a resident of rural Ireland. He is a heavy smoker with 40 pack-year history and a moderate daily alcohol consumer.  Past Medical History: Mr. O'Sullivan has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia for the past 15 years  both being managed through medication (ACE inhibitor and Statins accordingly). He refused taking medications for smoking cessation offered repeatedly in the past. There is a familial history of cardiovascular disease: his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68. His older brother underwent surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. O'Sullivan visits his GP complaining of a strange pulsating feeling in his stomach  which has been persistent for a couple of weeks. He also mentions intermittent  dull lower back pain and unexplained weight loss over the past few months. He denies any bowel  urinary  or lower limb complaints. No associated fever  night sweats  loss of consciousness or traumatic events. No recent changes in medication or over-the-counter drugs have been reported.   Notes: The patient's age  gender  smoking habits  long-standing hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history  as well as his symptoms  make him a representative case for AAA according to available epidemiologic data. AAA is most commonly diagnosed in older adults  particularly Caucasian males  and is often associated with genetic predisposition  smoking  and other cardiovascular conditions.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,47,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking. He comes from a middle-class socioeconomic background. The patient is a retired veteran from the military  now leading a sedentary lifestyle.  Past medical history: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he is currently receiving treatment with antihypertensives and statins  respectively. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He quit alcohol 10 years ago and has limited physical activity due to arthritis. The patient is obese (BMI: 32.5) with no special diet or exercise regimen. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died due to myocardial infarction  and his elder brother was diagnosed with AAA.  Key Complaints: The patient presented with intermittent abdominal pain which lasted for several hours  following which it subsided on its own. Pain was described as a sharp  tearing sensation radiating to his lower back. No associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  weight loss  loss of appetite  or any change in bowel habits were reported. The patient also indicated occasional palpitations and shortness of breath during exertion  indicating a potential cardiovascular complication.  Among AAAs  75% occur in males  and 90% happen in those aged 65 and above. Risk factors like smoking  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  age  male sex  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of AAA are consistent with epidemiological data. Although pain in AAAs is typically absent until rupture or dissection  in some cases  abdominal pain can occur  making every case unique and unpredictable. The case is designed in line with accurate demographic representation as found in literature.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,48,Patient Case:  Demographics: Mr. Thomas Miller  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  widower  retired factory worker  residing in Wisconsin. He is a former smoker with a 50-pack history and quit smoking about 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol socially.   Past Medical History: Mr. Miller suffers from moderate hypertension and high cholesterol. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) two years ago but never had any coronary artery disease. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his father dying from a myocardial infarction and his older brother from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He lives alone and has been managing his daily requirements independently. He has been on antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Miller presented at the emergency department with a sudden onset severe 'ripping' pain in his lower back that started a few hours ago along with persistent abdominal pain. He also complained of symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. He denies further symptoms like chest pain  loss of consciousness  or recent infections.   Note: This case represents the typical characteristics of a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm. The risk factors associated with AAA include age > 65 years  male sex  Caucasian race  history of cigarette smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  PAD  and a family history of AAA.   The learning objectives in this case should encompass proper history taking  identification of risk factors  recognizing early symptoms  physical examination for suspected AAA  indication for imaging and labs  understanding the size guide for treatment intervention  and knowledge of possible complications if left untreated.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,49,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. George Bryant is a 70-year-old Caucasian male; retired construction worker living alone. His wife passed away 5 years ago and he has two adult children living out of state. He is a smoker with 40 pack-years history and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which he takes lisinopril 10mg daily  and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with inhalers. He has no history of cardiovascular disease  no surgical history; particularly  he denies any history of abdominal surgery or trauma and has a negative family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the general practitioner clinic for a routine check-up. He describes intermittent  dull abdominal pain  and lower back discomfort that has been present for several weeks now. The pain does not get worse with meals. He also notes some unintentional weight loss over the past month but no fever  chills  night sweats  chest pain  shortness of breath  or leg pain.    This case represents a patient demographic with a high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). According to the literature  individuals over the age of 65 who have a history of smoking and hypertension are at a higher risk. Caucasians are more likely to develop AAA than African Americans  and men are more likely to develop AAA than women. Additionally  having a first-degree relative with an AAA increases a person's risk.   It also reflects a common presenting symptom of AAA – pain in the abdomen or back. Pain related to AAA tends to be chronic  steady  and severe—rather than acute and sharp—due to the relatively slow growth rate of the aneurysm which allows the surrounding tissue to gradually adapt to its presence. The nonspecific nature of the symptoms warrant further investigation especially considering the patient’s risk factors.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,50,Case Subject: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith  a white male  aged 72 years  retired construction worker  who is a lifetime smoker with a pack per day habit (30 pack years).   Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension for which he takes a low-dose thiazide diuretic and a beta-blocker. His hypertension is usually under moderate control. There is also a history of elevated cholesterol treated with atorvastatin 20mg. No history of surgeries or major illnesses. Family medical history includes heart disease in his father  who experienced a myocardial infarction at 65.   Key Complaints: Over the past few months  he has noticed a dull aching abdominal pain that seems to come and go  as well as moderate low back pain. He reports a recent episode of feeling faint after climbing a flight of stairs. He reports that his appetite is poor and he lost weight over the past few weeks. Moreover  he has experienced several episodes of unexplained fatigue. He visited a primary physician who referred him to the hospital for further workup following the finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass during a routine exam.  This simulated case scenario is representative of the demographic most at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms: older Caucasian males with a history of smoking and cardiovascular pathology  particularly hypertension. Symptoms like abdominal pain  back pain  unexplained weight loss  episodes of syncope  and an abdominal bruit could potentially indicate the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in such a high-risk individual. The hands-on experience allows medical students to gain a better understanding of the clinical presentations and risks associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms  promoting better patient outcomes in the future.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,51,"Chief Complaint: """"Severe abdominal and back pain.""""  Patient Information: H.M.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male currently residing in an urban location  was admitted to the emergency department. He is a retired mechanic and has a 40-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day until 5 years ago when he quit. H.M. lives with his wife who is his primary caregiver and is socially active in the community.   Past Medical History: H.M. suffers from hypertension and high cholesterol levels for the past 20 years  managed mostly by medications including Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. He has also been diagnosed with early-stage COPD due to his extended history of smoking. There is no relevant family history of genetic disorders but his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72.  Key Complaints:  H.M. was brought to the emergency on the complaint of sudden  severe pain in the lower back and abdominal region. The pain was not relieved by any over-the-counter pain medications. He also reported feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. Neither fever nor trauma history was reported. He also described experiencing episodes of light-headedness and shortness of breath in recent days.  Note: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm predominantly affects the elderly population (65 years and above) and is more common in males. Smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and diseases causing arterial damage such as atherosclerosis or COPD are major risk factors."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,52,Patient Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Name: John Williams Age: 72 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired carpenter Marital Status: Married Living situation: Lives with his wife in a suburban house   Medical History: Mr Williams has a well-documented medical history of hypertension  which has been managed for the last 15 years with Lisinopril. He is also a former smoker  having quit smoking cigarettes around 10 years ago but reportedly smoked a pack a day for 30 years before quitting. His family history is significant for his father  who died of a stroke at the age of 67. Furthermore  his cholesterol levels are on the higher side  and he has borderline diabetes which is managed through diet and exercise. He does not have any known drug allergies. His only surgery was an appendectomy at the age of 25.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Williams came to the clinic complaining about a consistent dull pain in his lower back and flanks experienced over the last few weeks. He also reported recent episodes of unexplained weight loss and decreased appetite. On specific questioning  he denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or syncope. He also denied any changes in bowel or bladder function  or any lower limb pain or weakness.   This case study focusses on abdominal aortic aneurysm  and the patient represents the demographic most commonly affected - older Caucasian males  with a history of smoking and hypertension. The symptoms though non-specific  can be indicative of a slowly expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion in such cases  considering the risk factors presented.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,53,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: • Patient Initials: J.D. • Age: 72 Years Old • Sex: Male • Race: Caucasian • Occupation: Retired firefighter • Socioeconomic Status: Middle Income • Location: Urban  Northeast United States  Past Medical History: • Hypertension (10 years). • Tobacco use: Heavy smoker for 35 years  quit 8 years ago. • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - Moderate (7 years). • No known allergies.  Presenting Complaints: • J.D. presented to the clinic with a 4-day history of episodic dull aching abdominal pain. • The pain described as ‘gnawing’ in nature and located in the central and lower part of his abdomen. It feels worse when he's lying flat. • He also reported a sensation of ‘pulsating’ in his abdomen  which he noticed in the last month. • Additional complaints included unintentional weight loss and reduced appetite in the previous 3 months. • He denies any changes in his bowel habits  chest pain  or palpitations.  The selected case focuses on the most vulnerable demographic for abdominal aortic aneurysm according to the literature: older  Caucasian males with a history of smoking and hypertension. Although AAA is sometimes asymptomatic  this scenario presents a case where the patient experiences some of the key complaints associated with the condition – such as abdominal pain and a pulsating sensation in the abdomen  allowing for proper education and training.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,54,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired accountant and working part-time as a consultant in the financial sector. He is married and has three grown-up children. He is an ex-smoker who quit around ten years ago and reports moderate alcohol consumption. His BMI is 29  effectively placing him in the overweight category.   Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension and has been managing it with prescribed antihypertensive medications over the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia eight years ago  but it is under control through combination therapy with diet and statins. His father died of a stroke at the age of 73  and his older brother had a myocardial infarction when he was 68. Additionally  he has bilateral osteoarthritis  for which he takes over-the-counter NSAIDs as needed. He had a prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia five years ago  and since then  reports no significant issues with his urinary system.  Key Complaints: The patient came to the clinic complaining of persistent lower back pain that did not improve with the use of over-the-counter pain medications. He described the pain as a deep  dull ache that isn’t associated with movement  sometimes associated with a pulsating sensation in the mid-abdominal region. Past week  he had episodes of mild nausea and loss of appetite. He denies having any bowel irregularities or any urinary complaints. He also mentioned feeling fatigued more than usual over the past few days. There is no reported trauma or sudden exertive activity that might have caused this back pain.  Note - It's important when teaching this case to elucidate that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common in older individuals  especially in those with a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  or a family history of aneurysms. They are also more common in males and Caucasians. Importantly  an AAA might not present with symptoms until it becomes large or ruptures  at which point it can be life-threatening. Thus  a high index of suspicion is warranted for this patient due to his risk factors and symptoms. A medical history of persistent  unexplained lower back pain or a pulsating sensation in the abdomen should raise suspicion of an AAA. The remaining course should detail how this case is diagnosed and managed.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,55,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. Zachary Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a diagnosis of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He has a 40-pack year smoking history but quit five years ago. He has no history of cardiovascular surgery but has a family history of vascular disease; his father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith has been attending regular follow-ups at the hypertension clinic. During his most recent visit  he complained of a new  vague  gnawing abdominal pain  mostly after meals and associated with mild back pain. No hemorrhagic signs  syncope  or changes in bowel habits were reported.  Noteworthy  Mr. Smith is a retired attorney and his past medical history is significant for type II diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  managed by Metformin 500 mg bid  Lisinopril 10 mg qd  and Simvastatin 20 mg qd respectively.  Notes: The prevalence of AAA increases with age and it is more common in men than women. Up to 80% of AAA cases are attributable to smoking. Notice that usually  AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture  then they become a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. However  some patients may report nonspecific abdominal or back pain. This case  therefore  reflects the common demographic of an AAA patient in terms of age  sex  smoking history  and relative symptoms. Additionally  key indicators such as hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a family history of vascular disease have been considered  as these are recognized risk factors for AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,56,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Presentation: Mr. Joseph Martin is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain  especially after meals  which has been getting progressively worse over the past two weeks. He describes the pain as a deep  gnawing ache in the middle of his abdomen. Occasionally  he also feels the pain radiating to his back. He has noticed an unusual pulsating sensation in his abdomen  which he describes as a 'heartbeat'. He denies any changes in bowel habits  nausea  vomiting  weight loss  or appetite loss. He denies any history of trauma or injury.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martin has a significant history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 40 pack-years of smoking. He does not have any known food or drug allergies. He has been on medication for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes a daily dose of Lisinopril (10 mg)  Amlodipine (5 mg)  and Atorvastatin (20 mg). He is not receiving any anticoagulant therapy. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) seven years ago and was stented. He does not have any surgical history.  Family History: Joseph's father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75. His mother lived until her mid-80s  passing away due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. He has one brother who had a stroke at the age of 59.  Social History:  Mr. Martin worked at a shipyard until his retirement five years ago. He is widowed and lives alone but in close proximity to his daughter. He stopped smoking two years ago but reports a significant history of heavy smoking prior to that (2 packs per day for about 40 years). He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use.   Reason for visit: Joseph scheduled his visit due to the progressive worsening of his intermittent abdominal and back pain. He expresses worry about his father's history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has been managing his discomfort with over-the-counter pain medications with little relief.  This case illustrates a typical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a high-risk patient given his age  male gender  significant smoking history  and a personal history of atherosclerotic disease. The genetic predisposition should also be taken into account considering his father's history of aneurysm rupture. The vascular examination in this patient should involve palpation of the abdominal aorta and auscultation for possible abdominal bruits. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,57,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Baker  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  presents to his primary care provider with complaints of abdominal pain and lower back discomfort.  Past Medical History: Mr. Baker has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 15 years. He has a 40-pack year smoking history  but quit about 5 years ago. He has no history of diabetes  cancer  or any previous surgeries. He drinks alcohol socially  has no known allergies  and his family history reveals his father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75.  Presenting Complaints: The patient has been experiencing intermittent  unexplained abdominal pain that seems to resolve spontaneously  only to return after a few weeks. The pain is generally located in the middle and slightly to the left of his abdomen. In recent weeks  he sometimes has a similar discomfort in his lower back.  Mr. Baker reports that the character of the pain is dull and throbbing  not colicky or burning. The pain doesn't seem to get better or worse with meals  different body posture or use of over-the-counter pain relievers. He rates it as 5 on a scale of 0-10 and reports a feeling of fullness in his stomach. He’s noted unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite over the past few months.  Physical Checkup: Vital signs are blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  pulse 85/min  respiratory rate 16/min  and body temperature 37.2°C (99°F). On physical examination  the doctor notes a pulsatile mass in the abdomen and bruit over the area.  This case lends itself to discussing risk factors (age  male gender  smoking  and family history)  symptomatology  and physical findings suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further  it provides an excellent platform to talk about the importance of regular monitoring and management of blood pressure and cholesterol levels  especially in patients with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,58,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 73 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired automobile mechanic  Patient Medical History: Smoker for 50 years  no prior known history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension for long standing (since age 60)  dyslipidemia  and no family history of aneurysms or peripheral vascular disease. Patient is annulled  lives alone  and depends on Social Security for healthcare. He has limited mobility due to osteoarthritis of the knees. No known drug allergies.  Chief Complaint: John came to the Emergency Department due to sudden onset  severe pain in the lower back that started roughly two hours ago. He described it as a tearing  sharp pain  non-radiating  10/10 in intensity  and nothing seems to relieve the pain. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or syncope. He also denies any lower extremity weakness  numbness  or loss of bowel or bladder control. He has no recent history of trauma. He also mentioned a slight feeling of fullness in the abdomen and his family noted that he looked pale.  Reason for Training Case: The patient's depiction of severe  sudden pain with a history of smoking and hypertension serve as classical presentations of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In addition  statistics indicate that Caucasian males over the age of 65  who have smoked  have the highest incidence of AAA. This training case would thereby aim to teach students appropriate management of a potential case of AAA  including the importance of immediate imaging  possibly leading to emergency surgical intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,59,"Title: Suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Information: John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male living in the city with his wife. Retired from a desk job  he leads a slightly sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels which have been managed with medication for the past 10 years. He smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years  but quit ten years ago. He does not consume alcohol. His father passed away at the age of 70 due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith came to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen  which he described as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""". The pain had started two hours prior to his arrival  and it seemed unrelated to any physical activity. He additionally reported feeling faint and also showed symptoms of nausea.  He stated that unlike his usual hypertension related discomfort  this time the pain began suddenly and it was severe in intensity. He also mentioned he had felt a pulsating sensation in his abdomen for last couple weeks but considered it to be a simple gastric problem.  Given Mr. Smith's age  medical history  family history  and specific symptoms presented  the emergent medical concern for his serious condition is an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic studies  such as an urgent abdominal ultrasound or CT scan  would be needed to confirm this diagnosis."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,60,Patient Case:   Demographics:  Patient is a 73-year-old White male named Joseph  a retired construction worker with a smoking history of 40 pack-years who lives with his wife.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of hypertension controlled on Lisinopril  high cholesterol  and atherosclerosis. No previous surgeries or allergies. Denies alcohol or drug use but has a substantial history of heavy smoking. Family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died of a myocardial infarction at 75.  Key Complaints:  Joseph presents with an intermittent throbbing pain in his lower back and abdomen. The pain started off as dull and mild about a week ago but has been increasing steadily and is now severe. He mentions there were times that the pain radiated towards his groin area. He also complaints about constipation for the last 3 days. He denies any fever  nausea  vomiting  changes in urine or bowel habits. He shares his concern regarding his father's history of heart disease and fears this pain could be heart-related. No recent changes in weight.   These complaints and medical history suggests the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). As per the literature  abdominal aortic aneurysm primarily affects older population with a predilection towards males and smokers. It is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. In line with these epidemiological aspects  our patient falls within the typical demographic and risk profile for AAA.   The next step will be to perform a physical examination  with an emphasis on the abdominal region. If the suspicion of AAA remains high  confirmatory imaging tests such as an ultrasound  CT  or MRI scan will be ordered.  Learning Objectives for the Medical Student:  1. Understand the risk factors (age  male gender  smoking  hypertension  atherosclerosis) and typical demographic profile for AAA. 2. Recognize the classic presentation with intermittent lower back and abdominal pain. 3. Realize the importance of considering AAA even if the patient does not complain of any symptoms as most AAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally. 4. Recognize the life-threatening complications of AAA  such as aneurysm rupture. 5. Familiarize with the various diagnostic modalities for AAA. 6. Understand the management options  including behavioral  pharmacological  and surgical interventions.  Reference: 1. Chaikof EL  Brewster DC. The care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,61,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  residing in the urban setting of Boston  Massachusetts. He is a long-time smoker with approximately 50 pack-years of exposure to tobacco. He lives with his wife and his alcohol consumption is moderate.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of Hypertension  Dyslipidemia  and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for which he is on medication including ACE inhibitors  statins  and bronchodilators. He has a known allergy to penicillin. His family history includes his father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.   Presenting Complaints:  The patient was referred by his primary care physician to the Emergency Department after his routine physical examination showed an abdominal mass that was palpable  pulsatile and tender on the mid to lower abdomen. He reports unintentional weight loss but denies any common symptoms such as abdominal pain  back pain  or leg pain; however  he occasionally experiences dizziness and shortness of breath.  This case is consistent with data suggesting that risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm increases with age  predominantly affects males  and is more common in the Caucasian population. Other key risk factors include smoking and history of cardiovascular diseases. As per literature  a significant number of cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic and are often discovered during routine physical examinations.   Note for educator:  Following this brief case presentation  engage students in a discussion inquiring on the necessary further investigations needed such as diagnostic imaging  possible complications  management options (conservative  endovascular repair  open surgery)  and preventive measures for people at risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,62,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information: Mr. John Hall is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer living with his wife in a suburban setting.  Past Medical History: Mr. Hall has been hypertensive for the last 20 years and has been taking Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors prescribed by his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 5 years ago and has been taking statins since then. He also has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but has quit smoking for the past 2 years. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases – both his father and grandfather died due to heart attacks in their early 70s.  Chief Complaints: He visited the emergency department with complaints of severe  sudden-onset abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back for the past 6 hours. The intensity of the pain has grown progressively worse. He rates the pain as 8/10 on the pain scale. He denies any nausea  vomiting  chest pain  shortness of breath  or changes in bowel and bladder habits.  Current Medications: 1. Lisinopril 10mg once daily (hypertension) 2. Atorvastatin 20mg once daily (hypercholesterolemia)  Given Mr. Hall’s advanced age  male gender  history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  smoking  and familial predisposition  he has significant risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The sudden severe and increasing abdominal pain  complemented by the back pain  could possibly point towards a rapidly enlarging or rupturing aneurysm.  This case study should help students identify the classic signs and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  familiarize them with the risk factors  and help to manage the emergent and challenging nature of the case. The focus should be on an immediate diagnostic evaluation  which usually includes ultrasound or CT scan  and immediate surgical intervention if AAA is confirmed. This is a critical learning case for students to understand the importance of early recognition  urgent diagnosis  and appropriate management for life-threatening conditions like AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,63,"Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics:  The patient is Mr. James Clark  a 72-year-old Caucasian male living in rural East Texas. He is a retired farmer and a veteran of the Vietnam War. His lifestyle history indicates he has been a habitual smoker with a 50-pack year smoking history and also known to consume alcohol moderately. The patient has been widowed for ten years and currently lives alone.   Past Medical History:  Patient has been diagnosed with Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that has been managed with medications for the past 15 years. Mr. Clark has a history of peripheral artery disease diagnosed 10 years ago. The patient gave a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died following a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and his mother from a stroke.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Clark walked into the Emergency Department himself with a chief complaint of sudden  severe pain in the lower back and abdomen that started approximately 4 hours before presentation. The pain  according to Mr. Clark  is “tearing” in nature  and he rates the severity as 10/10. Aside from the pain  he reports feeling faint  sweaty  and with increased heartbeats.  This case report is designed to represent the demography commonly diagnosed with AAA  mainly being older  Caucasian males with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease. When looking at literature  there is a consensus that male gender  age above 65 years  Caucasian race  smoking history  and atherosclerosis ( manifested here as peripheral artery disease  hypertension  high cholesterol) are seen as risk factors for the disease with many also having a familial predisposition.   The symptoms presented by Mr. Clark align with the acute presentation of a potentially rupturing AAA. Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain  commonly described as """"tearing """" is highly suggestive in the proper demographic with predisposing factors. The associated symptoms of faintness and increased heartbeats reflect significant blood loss  a complication of a ruptured aneurysm. This case will help students understand the urgency and the risk involved in dealing with such a clinical scenario. Medical and surgical options should be discussed considering the age  overall health status  and the patient's preference."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,64,Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm:  Patient Demographics: Patient's Name: Joseph White  Age: 72 Years Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  on medication  - 40 pack-years history of smoking  quit 5 years ago - Moderate alcohol consumption - No history of diabetes or cardiac diseases - Father died following a ‘ruptured aortic aneurysm’ at age 76  Key Complaints: - Occasional episodes of abdominal pain  described as a deep and gnawing discomfort  felt beneath the chest  not linked to meals  exertion  or posture - Lower back pain radiating to the back of the legs  intermittent  especially prominent after prolonged standing - Unexplained weight loss (around 5 kilos in the past six months) - No signs of chest discomfort or shortness of breath  NOTE:  The demographics  medical history  and symptoms are designed to reflect known epidemiological data about the abdominal aortic aneurysm. Men over 65  particularly those of Caucasian descent  smokers or former smokers  and those with a family history of the condition are at higher risk. Symptoms stated above  especially the pulsating feeling in the abdomen  are common. Although  it's essential to remember that many abdominal aortic aneurysms don't cause symptoms until they rupture.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,65,Patient Information:   Mr. Robert Brown  Caucasian male  72 years old  retired civil engineer  living in the suburban areas with his wife. He has three adult children who live within 1-2 hours' travel distance.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Brown has a documented history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for the past 15 years. He is currently being managed on Amlodipine 5mg and Atorvastatin 20mg  respectively. He has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. His father died following a stroke  and his sister has heart disease. His BMI is 28. He does not engage in regular exercise and reports moderate alcohol consumption. He is not on any anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.  Key Complaints:   Mr. Brown visits his general practitioner  complaining of intermittent abdominal pain and a feeling of 'fullness'  specifically after meals  that has been on and off for the last 3 weeks. He complains about occasional lower back discomfort. He denies any nausea  vomiting  changes in bowel movements  or any other gastrointestinal disturbances. He has not experienced any alarming weight change  loss of appetite  or overt mature.  Note:   This case is designed to demonstrate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA is responsible for 2% of all deaths in men over 65  and the demographic features of the patient (age > 65  male  Caucasian  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  history of smoking  and family history) are consistent with high-risk patients as indicated in the literature.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,66,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient information:  Mr. J.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department. He is a retired industrial worker and lives with his wife. He reports being a former smoker of 50 pack-years but quit smoking 10 years ago. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medications including atenolol and simvastatin. He does not drink alcohol. He reports no allergies. His family history is suggestive of cardiovascular disease and stroke in his father.  Key complaints:  Mr. J complains chiefly of sudden onset severe pain in the abdominal and back region occurring over the past few hours. He describes the pain as a tearing sensation  constant and not colicky. The pain radiates to his lower back and is not related to posture or movement. He rates his pain as 9/10. He also reports feeling mildly dizzy and sweaty but denies chest discomfort  shortness of breath  difficulty in urinating  or bowel movements.  On Physical Examination:  He is moderately built and well-nourished  appears anxious and slightly pale. His pulse is regular but fast (98 bpm) and blood pressure is high (165/95 mmHg). Examination of his abdomen reveals a pulsating mass in the middle and upper part of the abdomen that's tender on palpation. There is no evidence of peripheral edema.  In this case  the race of the patient is chosen as Caucasian male patient  as Caucasian men over the age of 65 are most often affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms. The history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiovascular diseases are significant risk factors in the development of aortic aneurysms. The presented symptoms like sudden severe abdominal and back pain  together with a pulsating abdominal mass  are particularly indicative of abdominal aortic aneurysm as per literature. The case is designed in such a way to train the medical students to make a comprehensive risk assessment  and the potential necessity for surgical interventions based on the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,67,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: • Name: John Anderson • Age: 68 years • Gender: Male • Occupation: Retired postal worker • Race: Caucasian  • Socioeconomic Status: Middle class • Geographical Location: Rural Midwest  Past Medical History: • Hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  • 30-pack-year history of smoking  quit 10 years ago • Family history of cardiovascular disease (Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 57) • Moderate alcohol consumption • No known drug allergies  • No history of pulmonary disease  diabetes  or hyperlipidemia   Present Complaints: • John has been experiencing episodic abdominal pain for the past month. The pain is typically localized in the middle and lower abdomen with occasional radiation to his lower back. • Pain scale is reported as a 6 out of 10  described as a dull and continuous ache exacerbated by eating. • He reports occasional feelings of fullness and discomfort after eating small amounts. • Denies any associated symptoms such as changes in bowel habits  chest pain or dyspnea. No history of urinary complaints. No history of neurological complaints. He also reports unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 lbs over the past two months. • John's primary healthcare provider has noted a pulsatile mass in his abdomen at his most recent annual checkup. • Vital signs: Blood pressure 145/90 mmHg; Pulse rate: 88 beats per minute; Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute; Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C); Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air.  Note Regarding Demographics: Abdominal Aortic Aneuryms are more common among males  individuals over the age of 65  those with a history of smoking  and in individuals with a family history of the disease.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,68,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  Name: Robert Williams Age: 75 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer   Past Medical History:  Mr. Williams is a former smoker  who quit 20 years ago but had smoked a pack a day for 30 years. He has had a history of high blood pressure which is well controlled with a calcium channel blocker  amlodipine. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia  managed with a statin. He has a family history notable for his father dying at the age of 60 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Williams has not had any symptoms related to AAA. His current complaints were occasional lower back pain  which he had attributed to age and his old army injuries. He sought care from his physician for a regular checkup.  On examination  the physician felt a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Considering his medical and family history  the physician characterized it as highly suspicious for AAA. The timing of his presentation matched the literature  as AAA tends to occur in the elderly population  more common in males and smokers  and those with a familial history are at increased risk.   This case can be used to educate medical students on the importance of family history and appropriate screening in high-risk population  also detailing how AAA may be asymptomatic until rupture  which often results in death if not treated immediately.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,69,Subject: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Training Case   Case Patient: Mr. John Lawson  Patient Demographics: - Age: 70 years - Race: Caucasian - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired  former heavy-duty mechanic - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally - Home: Lives alone  active social life with peers  Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed at 50 - Coronary artery disease  underwent Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 5 years ago. - Controls blood pressure with lifestyle interventions and antihypertensive medications - Lipid profile: LDL slightly elevated; HDL borderline low - Family history: Father died at 72 due to AAA rupture  mother has hypertension  Presenting Complaints: - Mild to moderate abdominal pain  described as a deep  gnawing pain  positioned centrally and slightly to the right  felt for last 1 month. - Occasionally the pain radiates to the lower back. - Episodic bouts of extreme fatigue. - Loss of appetite  resulting in unintentional weight loss.   Investigation: Further imaging and diagnostic tests will need to be carried out to confirm suspected AAA  discuss required lifestyle changes  potential endovascular surgery  or open repair depending on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm.   Discussion Points: - Link between patient's age  gender  family history  and likelihood of AAA. - Importance of recognizing typical and atypical symptoms of AAA. - Connection between hypertension  coronary artery disease  and the risk of developing AAA. - Effects of race and ethnicity on the risk of developing AAA. - Role of primary care in diagnosing AAA  initiating early management strategies  including lifestyle changes and  if necessary  referring for specialist care. - Appropriate management strategies in AAA including the risks and benefits of different surgical interventions. - Regular follow-ups for patients who have or are at risk of developing AAA.  The key to this teaching case is how Mr. Lawson's case demonstrates typical risk factors and signs of AAA  thus providing a deeper understanding of the condition and the comprehensive care needed to manage it.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,70,Case Study - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics: Mr. Robert is an 80-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired  married  and is an ex-smoker with a 60 pack-year history. He has no significant alcohol history but reported a sedentary lifestyle. He is a retired truck driver and lives with his wife in a suburban area.  Past Medical History: Mr. Robert has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. He was diagnosed with these conditions in his late 50s and has been on medication since. His hypertension is relatively well controlled but has occasional spikes. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to his smoking history  for which he requires inhaler therapy. He has no history of diabetes  stroke  or heart conditions  but there is a familial history of cardiovascular misadventures  including his father passing away from a heart attack at a similar age.  Key Complaints: Mr. Robert came to his doctor's office complaining of intermittent  yet persistent lower back and abdominal pain for the last couple of months. The pain has been non-radiating  dull and vague  often described as a gnawing feeling that is unrelated to meals or physical activities. More recently  the patient admits to feeling a pulsing sensation in his abdomen. He has had no changes in bowel habit  no weight loss  and no other urinary or bowel symptoms.  The complaints suggested by Mr. Robert are typical for asymptomatic AAA  constituting abdominal pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass. According to the literature  risk factors for AAA correlate with Mr. Robert's profile  notably  being over 65  a male  Caucasian  having a history of smoking  family history of AAA  and hypertension (Upchurch & Schaub  2006). Therefore  this case study  centered on such a patient  will help medical students understand the risk factors  presentation  and management of AAA more effectively.   Reference: Upchurch  G. R.  & Schaub  T. A. (2006). Abdominal aortic aneurysm. American Family Physician  73(7)  1198-1204.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,71,"Patient Profile:  Mr. John Cook  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired military veteran. He is a lifetime non-smoker  but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Cook has a medical history of hypertension for 20 years  which is well-managed by Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with borderline hyperlipidemia a decade ago. His father passed away at 77 due to complications following an aortic aneurysm rupture. John does not have a history of Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  trauma  or syphilis - conditions known to have an association with aortic aneurysms. Routine physical examinations and blood work have been consistent and within normal limits over the years  given his age and medical conditions.  Presenting Complaints:  John visited the clinic with a 2-week history of persistent abdominal and lower back pain  which he described as a dull ache. These symptoms were not associated with food intake or physical activity. Also  he complained about a feeling of """"fullness"""" in his stomach even when he hadn't eaten. He also mentioned unintentional weight loss over the last few months.  Family History:  John's father had abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother  who is 88 years old  has been diagnosed with osteoporosis and hypertension. He has two siblings; a brother aged 70 with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a sister  68 years old  healthy with no known diseases.  Reason for Focus:  The case focuses on abdominal aortic aneurysm  which are most commonly seen in males over the age of 60. At this age group  the incidence is higher in Caucasians  smokers  hypertensive individuals  and those with family history of AAA. This case provides a typical presentation of an unruptured AAA with symptoms including persistent abdominal and lower back pain. Understanding and recognizing these symptoms are crucial for early diagnosis and management of this potentially fatal condition."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,72,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:  - Patient Initials: M.B. - Age: 72 years old. - Sex: Male. - Race: white - Occupation: Retired teacher.  Medical history:  M.B. has a medical history tracking back decades ago  which includes hypertension  high cholesterol  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He used to be a heavy smoker but quit 6 years ago due to COPD. He had no previous surgeries  keeps up-to-date on health screenings  and has never had a personal or familial history of AAA.   Present Complaints:  M.B. came into the doctor’s office complaining of persistent  unusual lower back pain that he originally pegged as something related to pulled muscles from gardening. However  this pain persisted and he has also noticed an occasional pulsating sensation in his abdomen around the navel. He regularly checks his BP at home and notes that it has been consistently higher than usual in the last few weeks. He denies any drastic weight loss  loss of appetite  or recent change in bowel habits.   This case reflects the general demographic that is commonly affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms – mostly older adults  particularly men  and those with a history of cardiovascular conditions or smoking. M.B.’s troubling symptom  the pulsating sensation in his abdomen  commonly points towards an AAA  matching perfectly with his demographic and patient history for high-risk factors of AAA. Through this case study  medical students can understand the typical presentation of an AAA in a patient and predict the probable next steps for diagnosing and managing AAA in such patients.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,73,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Presentation:  Mr. J.A  is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired electrician  referred to the outpatient surgery clinic by his primary care physician.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 44-pack year smoking history  having smoked one pack per day for 44 years  which he quit approximately two years ago. However  he does not have any history of other cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. He also has no any familial history of aneurysmal disease.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with intermittent lower back pain for the last four months  which he primarily attributes to age and his prior physically strenuous occupation. The pain does not radiate and is not associated with activity. Recently  he noticed an increase in the intensity of the pain and experienced an episode of light-headedness which prompted a visit to his primary care doctor.  Considerations:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) incidence is higher in males  Caucasians  and individuals over 60 years of age. Risk factors include smoking history  hypertension  and familial history of the disease. Hypertension and smoking are particularly important factors for AAA and must be explored in patient's past medical history. For demographic representations  Caucasians are selected which should educate learners regarding the higher incidence of AAA in this population.   Next Steps: Teaching should focus on ordering appropriate investigations  interpreting the results  and discussing a management plan with the patient. This should include an ultrasound or a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size of the aneurysm  monitoring or surgical intervention depending on the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm  and risk factor management including smoking cessation  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia control.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,74,"Patient Information:   Mr. Eugene Johnson  an 82-year-old white male  is currently living with his daughter and son-in-law after his wife passed away last year. His occupation was a coal miner before his retirement  indicating potential occupational exposure. He has a record of moderate smoking and had been a regular alcohol consumer until his late 50s. He is relatively sedentary and does not engage in any regular exercises.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension  which is reasonably well controlled on amlodipine and atenolol. He has a high cholesterol level but no diagnosed history of cardiovascular disease. He does not have diabetes  but he has COPD likely secondary to his past smoking and work exposure. He's been on inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to manage his COPD.  Presenting Complaint:  He visits the clinic with a complaint of """"unusual"""" pulsating sensation in his abdomen for past few weeks  associated with intermittent  vague  mild lower abdominal pain. The pulsations get sometimes more noticeable when lying flat. He denies any radiation of pain towards back  chest pain  syncopal episodes  or significant weight loss. No bowel or bladder disturbances have been noticed  and he has not felt feverish or overly tired. He also mentions that he cannot recall any significant changes to his diet or bowel movements.  The clinical vignette as mentioned above is purposefully designed to include demographics & risk factors typically associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - age over 60  male gender  history of smoking  hypertension  and presence of COPD. The incidence of AAA tends to be higher in white populations.  Clinical suspicion should be raised with his unusual complaint of abdominal pulsations  which is not common in the general population but is noticed in >80% of AAA. His intermittent lower abdominal pain  although nonspecific  may potentially indicate early symptoms of AAA expansion or imminent rupture.   However  due to the often asymptomatic presentation of AAA until critical stages  heightened clinical suspicion based on associated risk factors and certain nonspecific symptoms is key in making an early diagnosis and managing this condition effectively and promptly."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,75,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:  Mr. Hernandez is a 65-year-old Caucasian male of Hispanic ethnicity living in a suburban setting. This particular demographic has been chosen as the incidence of AAA is often reported highest in Caucasian males above 65 years and people of Hispanic ethnicity also have a significant predisposition to AAA.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of long-term smoking of about 30 pack years and moderate alcohol use until 5 years ago. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years back and is on antihypertensive medications - Amlodipine (5mg/day) and Atorvastatin (20mg/day) respectively. He was found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and is under Metformin (500mg twice a day). He had an inferior wall myocardial infarction 3 years back and underwent stenting. No known history of AAA in the family.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Hernandez visited his primary care physician complaining of a persistent dull and vague pain in his lower back and lower abdomen for the past 3 weeks. He also mentioned occasional constipation and slight difficulty in urination. In addition  he reported feeling a pulsatile mass in his stomach.   However  he doesn’t have any symptoms of leg pain  claudication  or rapid increase in the abdominal girth. He denied any chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath. There is no history of fever  chills  or nausea/vomiting.  Assessment:  Further investigations are warranted given the risk factors and the symptoms Mr. Hernandez has reported. An initial physical exam and subsequent abdominal ultrasound or CT angiography could be considered to check for the presence of an AAA. A team-based approach involving the primary care physician  radiologist  and vascular surgeon would be appropriate for comprehensive care and decision-making.  The prime objective of this case study would be to demonstrate the early detection of AAA  the significance of clinical acumen in reaching diagnosis  and the long-term management of AAA.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,76,Patient Information:   - Name: John Smith - Age: 72 - Gender: Male  - Occupation: Retired teacher - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Marital Status: Married - Number of children: 2  Medical History:  - Hypertension for the past 10 years  on treatment - Moderate smoker for 40 years  20 cigarettes/day on average  quit 10 years ago  Key Complaints:  - Presents with a sudden intense pain in the lower back and abdomen which started around two hours ago. - The pain is described as a pulsating feeling in his stomach area  around the navel. - Light-headedness and signs of shock (pallor  increased heart rate). - Additionally  patient mentions noticeable weight loss over the past few months.  Summary:  This training case involves a 72-year old Caucasian male retiree with a history of hypertension and long-term tobacco use. He presents with sudden onset of severe lower back and abdominal pain described as pulsating around his navel  along with signs of shock and recent weight loss. This case should prompt medical students to consider a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  especially taking into account his demographic profile (age  male  Caucasian) and risk factors (hypertension and history of smoking). The case encourages students to outline the proper diagnostic steps  including physical examination and imaging studies  as well as to discuss the treatment options appropriate for the patient's condition.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,77,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Description:  Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez is a 70-year-old Hispanic male presenting at your clinic for his annual medical checkup. He has an occupational history as a long-term heavy-duty truck driver  which significantly involves sedentary lifestyle. He has been a chain smoker for the last 50 years  but he claims he is trying to quit. He lives with his wife in a rural area with minimal access to quality health care.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with both hypertension and high cholesterol 10 years ago. Despite his condition  he has not been adherent to his treatments or routinely monitored his health status. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a heart attack at age 76  and his older sister suffers from peripheral arterial disease.  Presenting Complaints:  During the last two weeks  he has been experiencing intermittent  nagging abdominal pain and occasional lower back ache since a month. Initially  he associated it with his longstanding chronic gastritis and ignored it. However  recently the pain progressively increased in intensity  along with feelings of fullness in his abdomen  which pushed him to come for this appointment.   Key Note:  This case report is representative of the key demographic most likely to experience an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). According to research  men  especially those over the age of 65  are at a higher risk of developing AAA. AAA are more common in white populations  but that does not exclude it from other races. Other risk factors which are represented in this case include long-term smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  a family history of AAA  and a history of heart disease.     The case study doesn't not just focus on diagnosis and treatment  but also emphasizes the importance of routine health checks  managing risk factors (such as smoking cessation)  and the potential risks of inaccessible or inadequate healthcare  particularly in rural areas. The character in this case also fits into the higher risk scenario due to his old age  Hispanic origin  and male gender  making the case more realistic and inclusive. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,78,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:   Name: Mr. John Peterson   Age: 72 years   Sex: Male   Race: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired Military Staff   Geographic location: Rural Midwest  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for the past 15 years  managed by beta-blockers - Moderate smoker for 45 years (30 pack years) - Treated for high cholesterol for a decade - Family history of aortic aneurysm (deceased brother)  Key Complaints: Patient came to the hospital complaining of: - Lower back pain  described as a deep  throbbing constant ache  scoring 7/10 on the pain scale  with a duration of two weeks. - The related discomfort is causing him to have distal radiating pain toward the groin area. - He also expresses episodes of alarming lightheadedness  particularly upon sudden standing. - Recently noticed unexplained weight loss - No complaints of fever  nausea  vomiting or changes in bowels or urine. - Denies any form of chest pain or shortness of breath.  Note: The patient’s signs and symptoms along with the demographic profile characterized by his age  gender  smoking history  and family history are highly suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA has been found to occur more frequently in older males  particularly those with family history  hypertension  and history of smoking. AAA most frequently occurs in the white population and its prevalence is noted to increase with age. More than 80% of individuals affected by this condition are over 65 years old. All these should guide students toward the suspicion of AAA as they encounter such cases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,79,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. Wilson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the emergency room.  Past Medical History: He has been known to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years  controlling both conditions with medications. He quit smoking 5 years ago but had a 45-year history of tobacco use. No history of diabetes. Family history reveals that his father died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm in his late 70s.  Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the ER as an urgent admittance  complaining of severe  sudden onset abdominal pain radiating to his back. He described his pain as """"tearing."""" He has been feeling faint and has had profuse sweating. He also reported episodes of claudication (leg pain/cramping triggered by activity) in recent months. No palpable mass was initially felt upon physical examination  potentially due to the patient’s large body habitus. Assessment of the patient's heart revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Given the demographic propensity  the high-risk factors such as the history of nicotine use  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history indicative of AAA  and the classic symptoms described by the patient  an abdominal aortic aneurysm was immediately suspected.   NOTE: Literature often cites Caucasian males over the age of 65  especially those with a history of smoking  as having a higher risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. A family history of AAA also increases the risk. The patient’s symptoms of sudden  severe abdominal pain  back pain  dizziness  and claudication further facilitate a swift diagnosis. It's recommended that the role play includes accurate representation of these facts and necessary investigations to confirm the diagnosis (i.e.  abdominal ultrasonography  CT scan) followed by management (i.e.  possible surgical repair if the aneurysm is large or symptomatic)."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,80,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John S.  a 70-year old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: Mr. S is a former smoker  having smoked for 20 years before quitting at the age of 50. He has a significant past medical history including hypertension managed by thiazide diuretics  hyperlipidemia managed with statins  and a family history of cardiovascular health issues. His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a BMI falling in the obese category. He doesn't consume alcohol  has no known allergies and is compliant with his medications.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. S presented to the ER with the chief complaint of severe abdominal pain radiating to his back that started several hours ago. He articulates that the pain is a strong  ripping feeling that started suddenly. He also describes feeling light-headed and faint.  Upon initial assessment  vital signs are as follows: BP is reading low at 90/60 mmHg  heart rate is slightly elevated at 85 bpm  respiratory rate sits at 20/min  temperature is normal at 37.1C  and O2 saturation at 95% on room air. No previous record of blood pressure measurements is found. Patient appears anxious and slightly diaphoretic  but otherwise has no external signs of injuries or distress.  Considering the patient's age  past personal and medical histories  as well as the primary symptoms  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a top diagnostic differential.   This case is based on demographic and clinical characteristics found in literature for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms is higher among males  typically individuals older than 65 years. Main risk factors include smoking  hypertension  and a family history of the condition. The classic triad of an aneurysm rupture  which occurs in about half of the cases  includes abdominal pain  hypotension  and a palpable abdominal mass. However  this triad is not always complete in every patient  as noticeable in this case. The aim will be to stabilize the patient and arrange for urgent confirmatory tests and imaging.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,81,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. White - Gender: Male - Age: 68 years  - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired military officer  Past Medical History: Mr. White is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago but has a long history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia; both conditions have been managed with life-style modifications and medications. He has a previous history of 40-pack years smoking. He has no known drug allergies. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and older brother succumbing to myocardial infarction in their mid to late 60s. He is currently on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) and a statin (Atorvastatin) for cholesterol control.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. White presents to the clinic with an asymptomatically noticed pulsatile mass in his abdomen. He also mentions feeling a pulse in his stomach and lower back pain that comes and goes but dismisses it as age-related. Occasionally  the pain radiates to his groin and hip. On further probing  he reveals experiencing unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite over the past few months.   Demographic Consideration: The choice of a Caucasian male aged above 65 aligns with known demographic representation in literature. Older age  male gender  history of smoking  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease are significant risk factors for the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (Kumar et al.  2018).

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,82,Case report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. The patient is a retired construction manager and lives with his wife. He has a 45 pack-year smoking history and has a BMI of 29. He reports moderate alcohol use. He's got a limited activity level due to chronic lower back pain.   Past Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension  which he has been struggling with for the past 12 years; hyperlipidemia  for which he is on statin and omega-3 treatment; type 2 diabetes  controlled by Metformin; and osteoarthritis. He has had a prior myocardial infarction 5 years ago for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and is on Aspirin and Clopidogrel. The patient's father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 68.   Key Complaints: The patient came to the emergency department reporting an acute onset of severe abdominal pain  which he rated as 8/10. The pain is central and radiates to his lower back  which he described as different from his chronic lower back pain. He also mentions lightheadedness and feelings of faintness. He has not experienced any vomiting  fever  or changes in bowel movements.   This case was designed to represent typical presentations of abdominal aortic aneurysms  keeping in line with usual demographics: older age  male sex  prior history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and a family history of AAA. Persistent or severe abdominal and lower back pain in older patients with these risk factors should prompt consideration of an AAA. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to reduce mortality.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,83,Patient Profile: Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Age: 70 Occupation: Retired banker Low-income background  Medical History:  Smoker for 50 years  quit smoking 5 years ago. History of hypertension managed with antihypertensives. Has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient approaches the emergency room complaining about severe  sudden onset abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back  lasting for a few hours. He also reports feeling faint  accompanied by cold  sweaty skin. He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction  fever  cough  or chest pain.   The above case represents a typical demographic profile for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) – elderly  smoking history  hypertension  and male gender  as these are significant risk factors. AAA is more common in Caucasian males  while its prevalence among females is lower and women generally present at an older age. Smoking history  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease fill threaten to increase the risk of AAA. Although the patient quit smoking  the extended length of previous smoking history is still a significant risk factor. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain radiating to the lower back is classic for a rupturing AAA  though it should be noted many AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,84,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics: Mr. Grant is a 71-year-old Caucasian male presented to the clinic by himself. He is a retired engineer and a widower living with his daughter’s family in the same city. He has a history of smoking (30 pack years)  but quit 10 years ago. Mr. Grant is also a veteran with exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Having Medicare coverage  he has an inconsistent follow-up history due to frequent travels after retirement.   Past Medical History: Mr. Grant was previously diagnosed and treated for Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia 20 years ago and has been managing the conditions with a combination of dietary adjustments and medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily). He also has a history of Moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) secondary to smoking  managed with inhaled corticosteroids. There is a familial history of heart disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 78.  Key Complaints: Mr. Grant presented with the chief complaint of intermittent  dull  and non-radiating abdominal pain for the past week. The pain seems to be located around the navel area. He previously attributed it to indigestion but became concerned because it has been persistent. He has been experiencing mild lower back pain as well. Furthermore  he reports a feeling of """"fullness"""" in his stomach after eating just a small amount of food  decreased appetite  but no weight loss  nausea  or vomiting. He denies any change in bowel habits  visible blood in stool  urinary symptoms  or fever. On questioning  he reports some dizziness and fatigue  but no chest pain or shortness of breath. Apart from these  he presented no other symptoms.  (Note: This case was designed to be representative of the usual demographic of patients who get AAA  which is more common in men  particularly those over the age of 65 with a history of smoking. Additional risk factors which are taken into account include hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of heart disease  veterans with exposure to Agent Orange  and Caucasian descent.)"
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,85,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics: The patient is an 80-year-old Caucasian man  retired and living independently. He has a 50-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol. His BMI is 28  which is on the higher side of the normal range.   Past Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are controlled with medications for the past 10 years. He has prior history of occasional bouts of abdominal and lower back pain as well as frequent heartburn  for which he takes over-the-counter antacids. He had colonoscopy 5 years ago with no significant findings. He has no known allergies  no previous hospitalizations or surgeries. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; his father died from myocardial infarction at age of 72. He is a widower and lives with his daughter.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain  radiating to his lower back. The pain was described as a tearing sensation  8/10 in severity. It started while he was gardening and has been constant since then  not relieved by rest.  Given the patient's demographics  smoking history  co-existing vascular risk factors and clinical complaints  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is quite likely. Studies suggest that AAA are more common in older men  especially above 65 years  and incidence is higher amongst Caucasians  smokers  and those with a family history.  Note: This case represents a classical presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which is essentially a silent condition in most cases. It is designed for medical education purposes and is not intended to cover all possible clinical presentations of AAA. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,86,Case Report  Patient Details: Mr. John Little  a Caucasian male  aged 72  from a middle-class background. He is a retired construction worker and has a history of heavy smoking of about 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He moderately consumes alcohol  averaging 2-3 drinks per day. His family history reveals that his father died at the age of 80 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Past Medical History: Mr. Little has been previously diagnosed with essential hypertension and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is on drugs for his hypertension and uses bronchodilators for his COPD. There was a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 5 years ago  but he has not had a repeat episode. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 27 Kg/m2 and his medical records indicate occasional elevated cholesterol levels.  Key Complaints: The patient came to the outpatient department complaining about intermittent abdominal and low-back pain persisting for a couple of weeks. His pain is manifested as a dull ache and he occasionally experiences a pulsating sensation in his stomach. He reports no fever  trauma  nausea  or vomiting. Moreover  he has reported no blood in his stool or violent coughing but admits to feeling fatigued lately.  Context: Current data suggests that Caucasians  particularly males over 65 years old who have a smoking history  are at a higher risk group for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A positive family history also increases the risk. It is found that hypertension  COPD  and older age can increase the likelihood of AAA diagnosis and rupture. Mostly  AAAs are asymptomatic  but patients may present with vaguely defined abdominal or back pain. Therefore  Mr. Little’s presentation is quite characteristic of a possible AAA. This case can be used to discuss screening options  diagnosis  potential complications  and management of AAA considering the patient's profile  risks  and symptoms.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,87,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. John Hamilton is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who resides in a suburban region. He is a retired mechanic  married with three grown-up children. Mr. Hamilton is a smoker and has been smoking one pack a day for the past 45 years. He stands at 5'8"""" and weighs around 185 lbs  indicating a BMI of 28.1  which is in the overweight range.   Past Medical History: Mr. Hamilton has hypertension  managed by Metoprolol 50 mg once daily for the past ten years. His blood pressure has been reasonably controlled  generally staying within the 130/80-140/90 mmHg range. Additionally  he has hyperlipidemia for which he is on Atorvastatin 20 mg daily over the last six years. Other than these  he has no history of any other notable condition like diabetes  renal disease or cardiac issues. He has no known drug allergies. His father died at the age of 75 due to a ruptured AAA.  Key Complaints: Mr. Hamilton visited the clinic today complaining of consistent but tolerable abdominal pain that has persisted for the last two weeks. The pain is described as a deep  steady pain located in the central abdominal area  radiating to the back at times.  According to a study by Kent KC  abdominal aortic aneurysms occur predominantly in the elderly population  primarily Caucasians  with a significant history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of AAA (Kent KC  2014)  similar to Mr. Hamilton's demographics and past medical history. The presentation of radiating abdominal pain is also a common symptom of AAA.  This case has been designed to serve as an educational tool  focusing on the identification  assessment  and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm in elderly patients  emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention to prevent complications such as rupture.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,88,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information  - Name: John Doe - Age: 73 years old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired truck driver  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels well-managed on medication. He is also a current smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. There is no family history of cardiovascular disease. He is not physically active and has been overweight for much of his adult life.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Doe presented to his primary care physician with complaints of intermittent and unpredictable abdominal pain for the past few weeks. The pain is localized to the middle and lowers part of the abdomen and sometimes radiates to the back. The pain is dull  not severe  and lasts for several minutes before subsiding. There are no aggravating or relieving factors. He has also been feeling light-headed at times but has not fainted. He denies any chest pain  cough  or shortness of breath.  Physical Examination:  Mr. Doe is alert and oriented. His blood pressure measured in the office was 154/92 mmHg on two separate occasions. His pulse is regular at 85 beats per minute. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal area  which corresponds to the location of his pain. There is no bruit heard over the abdominal mass. The remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable.  This case is designed to represent the most common demographic and risk factors associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm including male sex  Caucasian race  age over 65 years  a history of smoking  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol. The key presenting symptoms of unpredictable abdominal pain  the feeling of light-headedness  and pulsatile abdominal mass should point the medical students towards AAA as a working diagnosis.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,89,Patient Information: Mr. Williams  a 72-year-old African-American man  retired professional.  Chief Complaint: “I have been having a nagging mild pain in my lower back and abdomen for the last few weeks. Recently  the pain has grown more intense intermittently.”  Past Medical History: Mr. Williams is a former smoker (80 pack/year history)  quit 10 years ago. He has been living with well-managed hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 15 years and is currently under medication. He suffers from mild COPD due to his past history of smoking. He does not have any history of major surgical past. He lives by himself and enjoys a continually active social life. His diet is of concern  which is primarily composed of processed food with high-sodium content.  Family History: His father passed away at the age of 77 due to an 'abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.' His mother died at 84 due to stroke complications. He has an elder brother who was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75.  Physical Examination: Vital signs show slightly elevated BP at 145/90  heart rate at 78 bpm  respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass on palpation.  Considering the the patient's demographic profile  age  and significant risk factors such as a positive family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm  history of smoking  hypertension and hyperlipidemia  a preliminary diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is made pending further diagnostic investigations.  This case gives an opportunity to discuss the risk factors  clinical presentation and the role of family history in diseases like abdominal aortic aneurysm. It also allows the learner to correlate the chief complaints with the possible diagnosis while acknowledging the role and importance of taking a detailed family history in diagnosis. This also gives the chance to discuss steps for further diagnosis and management plan in such cases.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,90,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Edward Mitchell  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Concerns: Mr. Mitchell came to the clinic complaining of sudden  severe abdominal and lower back pain. The pain is described as a constant  sharp sensation  not easing in any position or during rest. It's accompanied by a faint pulsating feeling in his abdomen.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension  managed with beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the past ten years. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily for about 50 years. He had a surgical history of an appendectomy about 20 years ago. There is also a family history of aneurysms  with his father dying from a ruptured abdominal aorta. Mitchell is about 20 pounds overweight  and his diet is high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables.  Socioeconomic Details & Lifestyle: Mr. Mitchell is a retired locksmith and lives with his wife in a suburban area. His alcohol consumption is limited to social occasions.  Epidemiology: According to studies  abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are predominantly seen in older adults  particularly men aged 65-75  and are more common in Caucasians compared to other races. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  male gender  genetic predisposition  and a history of vascular disease. The case of Mr. Mitchell is representative of these epidemiological findings.   Points for discussion: - Importance of considering AAA in older  male patients presenting with abdominal or back pain. - Roles of smoking and hypertension in the development of AAA. - Relevance of family history in AAA. - Potential management and treatment strategies for AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,91,Patient Case: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:   Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  widower and retired construction worker.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a 30-year history of hypertension  and type II diabetes mellitus for 15 years. He is obese with a body mass index of 32. He is a former smoker but ceased smoking 10 years ago after a 40-pack-year history. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died from myocardial infarction in his 60s  and his older brother was diagnosed with AAA and had repair surgery a few years ago.   Chief Complaint:   Mr. Smith presents to the clinic with a complaint of intermittent  vague abdominal discomfort mostly in the lower abdomen over the past two weeks. He says it feels like a dull ache and has been happening mostly after meals  which he initially presumed to be indigestion. He denies any sharp or darting pain  fever  nausea or vomiting  loss of appetite  or change in bowel habits. However  he has noticed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  along with occasional lightheadedness.   Rationale:   The patient's advanced age  male sex  history of hypertension  smoking  family history of AAA  and Caucasian ethnicity are risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm as represented in the literature. This clinical presentation draws a large differential diagnosis  but given his intrinsic risk  a high suspicion for AAA is warranted.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,92,Patient Case: Mr. John Caldwell  Demographics:   John Caldwell is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting at the emergency department. He is a retired mechanical engineer  who lives independently with his wife in an urban setting. He is a former smoker  with a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit the habit 8 years ago. He has an occasional alcohol intake and is not active physically due to his health condition.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Caldwell has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he has been on medication (Lisinopril 10mg/day and Simvastatin 20mg/day respectively) for 20 years. His mother had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died in her late eighties due to its rupture. He has no known allergies to any particular drug.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Caldwell's main concern is the sudden  severe pain in the middle and lower abdomen that began 3 hours ago  a sensation that he describes as “ripping” and “shooting towards his back”. Additionally  he has felt light-headed and had near syncope episodes today. Probing reveals that he has been experiencing intermittent and mild abdominal discomfort and back pain for the past week  but he did not give it much importance.  Note:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is prevalent in the demographic of older  white males  with smoking history and positive family history  which is represented here. Uncontrollable hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a sedentary lifestyle  and a history of cardiovascular disease can also contribute to the development of AAA. Sudden  severe abdominal or back pain and symptoms of hypotension can signify an impending AAA rupture  a life-threatening situation.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,93,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Robert Smith Age: 73 years Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Military Officer Residence: Urban  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a 40-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day  has hypertension for which he’s been taking medication for the past ten years  and a family history of AAA (his older brother had ruptured AAA). He also has moderate obesity  with a history of high cholesterol. He is currently under medication for his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There’s no known history of diabetes or heart diseases.  Primary Complaints:  Mr. Smith attended his routine check-up and complained about a persistent dull ache in his lower back and abdomen that has been present for the last two weeks. He claims the discomfort is constant but not severe  likening it to a ‘gut feeling.' Along with this  he mentions experiencing episodes of mild nausea and unexplained fatigue despite maintaining a little physical activity.  Rationale for Design:  Most patients with AAA present asymptomatically; often it’s an incidental finding or diagnosed when complications occur. But in this case  we have a symptomatic patient. The demographics were chosen based on the literature: AAA is more common in men  typically presents after the age of 65  and is twice as common in smokers. Hypertension is another important risk factor. A family history of AAA also increases the risk. Therefore  this scenario offers a realistic case to teach key points about aneurysm  patient presentation  potential risk factors  and the importance of a thorough medical history to guide the diagnosis.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,94,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information:  Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 45-year smoking habit (1 pack per day). Mr. Johnson is a retired mechanic  lives with his wife  and is socially active.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol two decades ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago. He has been inconsistently controlling his medical problems with prescribed medications including anti-hypertensives  statins  and oral hypoglycemics due to his concern over side effects. There was no history of any heart disease or strokes  but his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 73.  Because of his long-term smoking habit  he has a moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but has not considered cessation so far.   Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson visited the clinic with a complaint of mild  intermittent lower back pain for the last two weeks  radiating to his flanks and abdomen  not associated with any bowel or urinary symptoms. He also mentioned a weird sensation of fullness or pulsating mass in the abdomen he noticed a week ago. He denied any recent trauma or heavy lifting.   The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases with age and is more commonly found in the male population  particularly Caucasian ethnicity. The major risk factors include smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of AAA. History of other vascular diseases and diabetes have also been associated with an increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   [Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm often have no symptoms until the condition reaches an advanced stage or the aneurysm ruptures  leading to a medical emergency. In some cases  patients may experience lower back pain  a pulsating sensation in the abdomen  or abdominal pain.]   In the next part of training  we will illustrate how to perform a clinical examination for abdominal aortic aneurysm and the relevant investigations needed for its diagnosis and management. We will also discuss common pitfalls in diagnosing this condition and how to avoid them.   NOTE: [Text in square brackets] are additional information that could be used for the continuation of the case presentation learning activity.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,95,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information: Mr. Paul Jackson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  comes to the emergency department. Mr. Jackson is a retired steel worker and served in the U.S. army during his younger years. He currently resides in an urban area with his wife.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia approximately 10 years ago but admits to inconsistent medication use. There's a significant history of cigarette smoking (40 pack-years) although he quit five years ago. He also has a relevant family history of AAA with his elder brother experiencing a ruptured AAA at age 75.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Jackson presents with a complaint of sudden-onset lower back pain that started two hours ago. He characterizes his pain as sharp and severe  not radiating  and constant. He denies trauma. He states that he has never experienced pain like this before. He also admits to feeling light-headed and has vomited once at home. He denies chest pain  dyspnea  or lower extremity weakness. He appears to be in considerable discomfort.  Rationale:  The demographic and social details included in this case are representative of key risk factors associated with AAA  including age  male gender  smoking history  family history  and Caucasian ethnicity. Furthermore  the symptoms discussed (abdominal or back pain  light-headedness  and vomiting) are often associated with rapid expansion or impending rupture of an AAA. This case would then lead into a discussion about the differential diagnoses  appropriate clinical and imaging evaluation  emergency management  and surgical intervention. The scenario is designed to emphasize that in an elderly man with risk factors for AAA and a complaint of abdominal or lower back pain  AAA should be at the top of the differential until proven otherwise.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,96,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Robert Anderson is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who lives alone in an urban region. He is a retired engineer  and widower with two adult children living out-of-state. Mr. Anderson is a former smoker with a 25-pack-year history but quit 15 years ago. He is relatively sedentary and has a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  while managed on lisinopril 20 mg daily  he is often non-compliant with his medication. His other known conditions include hypercholesterolemia and peripheral artery disease. His BMI is classified as overweight  and he has a moderately high alcohol consumption. His father died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 60.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Anderson visited the clinic today with complaints of intermittent  pulsating abdominal pain for the past week that seems to be gradually worsening. He also reports feeling a pulsating mass in his abdomen. More recently  he started experiencing lower back pain but doesn't recall any injury or strenuous activity.  Case Summary: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are most common in men  particularly those of Caucasian descent  over 65 years of age. Risk factors often include a history of smoking  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and family history of AAA. They are also likely in individuals who are obese  have a high-fat diet  or a high alcohol usage.  In this case  Mr. Anderson's risk factors including age  gender  medical history  and lifestyle choices puts him at a high risk for AAA. His current complaints of a pulsating abdominal pain and the sensation of an abdominal mass could indicate an undiagnosed AAA. Given his family history  these symptoms cannot be ignored and must be promptly evaluated.  The goal of this case is to help medical students understand the risk factors  complaints  and possible physical findings associated with AAA. They should also consider the importance of compliance with chronic disease management and lifestyle modifications in preventing these types of conditions. Prompt diagnostic measures such as abdominal ultrasound or CT scan should be ordered to confirm the presence of an AAA.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,97,Case Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 73 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian (Data shows that AAA tends to be most common in Caucasian individuals) Occupation: Retired  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen. The patient comments that the pain is sharp and persistent  claiming it is unlike anything he has felt before. Furthermore  he is feeling lightheaded and has vomited twice at home before coming to the hospital.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with antihypertensives (Lisinopril) and lipid-lowering medications (Atorvastatin). He has a 40-pack-year smoking history and quit smoking 15 years ago. He has no history of surgeries and is not allergic to any medications. His father died from an 'abdominal explosion'  though Mr. Johnson is unsure of the specifics.   Physical Examination:  Mr. Johnson is noted to be in physical discomfort  holding his abdomen often during the assessment. His abdomen is visibly pulsating. During palpation  an abdominal mass is felt which is tender and pulsating. His blood pressure on presentation was 166/90  and his heart rate at 98 bpm.  This detailed case study accurately represents the risk factors  demographics  and complaints related to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. This case serves as a tool to verses the students about diagnostic tests such as ultrasound or CT scan  preventive measures  and potential treatments like endovascular surgery or open abdominal surgery for AAA  as well as emphasize on the importance of Smoking Cessation. It will assist the students in understanding and identifying an emergency situation that calls for prompt recognition  accurate diagnosis  and immediate intervention.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,98,Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  I. Patient Demographics: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  lives with his wife and is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago.  II. Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension for about 15 years  which is well managed through medication. He has hyperlipidemia  a BMI of 28  and a familial history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his elder brother underwent a surgical repair for AAA at the age of 65. The patient had smoked 1 pack per day for 30 years before quitting. He consumes alcohol moderately and does not have a history of illicit drug use.  III. Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at his primary care doctor  complaining of intermittent  dull abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past six weeks. The pain had recently intensified in the last 3 days  prompting the visit. He also reported feeling a pulsating sensation in his stomach  general fatigue  occasional low back pain  but denied any instances of syncope  rapid weight loss  or changes in bowel movements. He has not noticed any blood in his stool or urine.  (Note: This complies with demographic data suggesting that AAAs are most common in males  age of 65 or older  with a history of smoking  cardiovascular disease and hypertension. AAA is usually asymptomatic until it is close to rupture  at which point severe abdominal or back pain might occur. However  some patients  like the one in this scenario  may report minor  vague symptoms long before rupture.)
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,99,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics:  Mr. T  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  reports he is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history  having quit 10 years ago. He works retired from a stressful managerial job five years ago. He resides with his wife in a suburban area and admits to moderate daily alcohol consumption. His diet is often high in fats and red meats. His physical activity consists of daily walking for around 30 minutes.  Past Medical History:  Mr. T's medical history consists of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on treatment for these conditions for the past six years. He has no known allergies. Family history is significant for a brother who died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. A general health check 2 years ago was unremarkable and he has not had any recent surgical procedures.   Key Complaints:  Mr. T came to the doctor's office complaining of intermittent mild abdominal and lower back pain for the past month. He has also been feeling a pulsating sensation in his stomach. He has noticed that the pain seems to intensify after meals and when bending over or straining. He denies having any bowel or urinary complaints and weight loss. He has not had any known exposures to infectious diseases.  Remarks:  This training case focuses on abdominal aortic aneurysm  a condition that affects primarily older individuals  particularly males. Risk factors taken into account while designing this training case are age  gender  race  smoking history  family history of AAA  and presence of associated cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. With these parameters in place  medical students are able to work on a realistic patient profile while learning the key aspects of diagnosing and treating abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,10,100,"Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics Gender: Male Age: 73 years old Race: Caucasian Marital status: Married Occupation: Retired  Patient  Mr. James Bowman  is a 73-year-old Caucasian married male  who is a retired construction worker. He has two adult children and three grandchildren. He is a smoker with a 40 pack-year history. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 180 pounds. Patient lives with his wife and enjoys gardening and playing golf during his spare time.  Past Medical History Known hypertensive for the last 15 years  controlled with medical therapy  and is also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and peripheral artery disease. He has a past surgical history of a cholecystectomy. An identified risk factor includes a positive familial history of aneurysm (his father had a known aneurysm). The patient does not have any known allergies.  Key Complaints Mr. Bowman presented to the clinic with mild intermittent abdominal pain for the past two weeks  which he initially attributed to gastroenteritis. The pain is vaguely localized  and described as """"deep-seated """" of a pulsating nature. In addition  he has noticed a pulsating """"mass"""" like structure in his abdomen.   In training discussions  students should note that most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic  but approximately half can present with abdominal  lower back  or flank pain. Older males with cardiovascular risk factors (smoking  hypertension) and a family history are at higher risk  which is evident here. Further diagnostics are necessary to confirm  including a physical examination and imaging (e.g.  ultrasound  CT). If an aneurysm is confirmed  discussion about ongoing surveillance or surgical repair options would be dependent on size  rate of growth  and the patient's overall health profile.   Please note that an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to sudden death due to massive hemorrhage and prompt identification can greatly influence the prognosis.
