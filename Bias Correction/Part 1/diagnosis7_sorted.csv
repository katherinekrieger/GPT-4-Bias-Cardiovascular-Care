Critical Limb Ischemia,1,1,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 70-year-old African American male presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries  markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Demographics: Considerations in Mr. Smith's demographic information highlight the occurrence of CLI. The prevalence among African American males is almost double compared to their white counterparts  greatly attributed to higher rates of diabetes and renal disease. As per the age  CLI is more common in individuals over 60. The impact of race and age underscores the need for efficient detection and management.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a long history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) spanning for over ten years. He also has a ten-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3 five years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit 3 years prior  with a 30-pack-year smoking history. He has been on medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Presentation: Recently  Smith has been experiencing severe pain in his lower right limb  even at rest. He reported having noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. He was referred for angiography after a non-invasive vascular lab study revealed an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.4 in his right leg  indicative of severe arterial disease. On physical examination  we noted a decrease in temperature of the right lower limb  pallor on elevation and dependent rubor  absent pulses  and a necrotic ulcer on his right foot.  Conclusion: Mr Smith’s case represents a typical CLI patient in its demographic and clinical occurrence. His African American race  advanced age  history of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and renal disease all contribute to his current diagnosis. His critical limb ischemic status portrays the escalating severity of his condition and emphasizes the urgency for prompt and decisive management moving forward. The obscure prognosis reiterates the seriousness of the disease and the potential threat to limb and life. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,2,Subject: Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 72-year-old African American male  presented complaining of acute pain in his right foot  which has been worsening over the past week. The pain has been continuous with severity increasing further during periods of activity  such as walking or standing for long periods. He also complains of numbness and coldness of his right foot. Mr. Johnson has also noticed a non-healing ulcer on the big toe of the same foot for about a month.  Medical History:   Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus about 20 years ago  and hypertension 12 years ago. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 3 years back. His diabetes and hypertension are managed with oral medications.  Social History:  Mr. Johnson is a retired blue-collar worker  having worked in construction for most of his life. He smoked about one pack of cigarettes a day for 45 years but quit 2 years ago after his PAD diagnosis. He doesn't drink alcohol but has a sedentary lifestyle.  Family History:  His father died of stroke at 70  and his mother died of a heart attack at 72. His older sister was also diagnosed with type II diabetes at 55 and his younger brother died at 40 due to alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  his right lower limb was noticeably paler compared to the left  with a cold touch. The ulcer on his toe appeared pale and covered with necrotic tissue. His popliteal  posterior tibial  and dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable in the right limb.  Based on the symptoms  the chronic conditions he’s been suffering from (Diabetes and PAD)  family history  lifestyle  and physical presentation  the preliminary diagnosis made is Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This case presents a critical limb scenario due to the severity of arterial occlusion  represented by persistent severe pain  coldness and numbness  and appearance of a non-healing ulcer.  Further diagnostic procedures are suggested  including Ankle-Brachial Index Test and Imaging tests like Duplex Ultrasound  CT Angiography  or MR Angiography  to confirm the diagnosis and to plan for therapeutic interventions. Management options will be considered depending on the degree of occlusion and Mr. Johnson's overall health status. Considerations include medications  angioplasty  stent placement  atherectomy  bypass surgery  or in extreme cases  amputation. Stopping smoking  regular exercise  and maintaining a healthy diet would also be recommended to manage the disease and prevent its progression.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,3,Title: Case Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient  Patient Information: The patient is a 73-year-old Hispanic male who resides in an urban community setting. He is a retired construction worker and a former smoker  stating he quit 15 years ago. He reports moderate alcohol intake and a diet high in saturated fats and sugar. He is married with three adult children.   Medical History:  The patient has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he is on Metformin. His diabetes has been poorly controlled in the past  evidenced by elevated hemoglobin A1C levels. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with complaints of rest pain in the right lower leg that has become progressively worse over the past 4 months. He also reports that the foot has become progressively cooler to touch and he has noted skin color changes  such as pallor and cyanosis.   On examination:  Physical exam reveals an absent popliteal pulse and weak dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the right lower extremity. Capillary refill time in the right foot is delayed. Skin changes  including dryness and hair loss are observed on the right lower leg. Foot sensation is diminished on neurological exam.  The above presentation is consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  likely secondary to advanced peripheral artery disease. Early diagnosis and a multi-disciplinary approach involving internists  vascular surgeons  and endocrinologists are crucial for limb salvage  optimizing comorbid conditions and improving the patient's quality of life.   Demographically  this case aligns with literature which suggests that CLI commonly affects older individuals and is more prevalent among those with poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Smoking history and certain ethnicities  such as Hispanic and African American  are also linked with increased incidence of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,4,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Information:  Our patient is a 68-year-old Hispanic female presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). She resides in a rural county in Texas.  Presenting Symptoms:  She reports a six-month history of worsening lower limb pain  particularly severe at rest  characterized by burning and aching feelings and worse at night. She has developed non-healing sores on her both feet. She also has difficulty in walking due to the pain.   Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her diabetes has been poorly controlled. She is also a former smoker with a 35 pack year history. She has no known allergies.   Surgical History: She underwent cholecystectomy 15 years ago. There is no other critical surgical history.  Family History:  Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 73  her father had a history of heart disease and died at 78.   Social History:  She lives with her husband  eats a high carbohydrate and fat diet  and is not involved in any physical activities. She quit smoking 5 years ago. She works as a seamstress.  Medications:  She is on Metformin  Lisinopril and Simvastatin. She is adherent to medications as prescribed.   Physical Examination:  Upon examination  both lower extremities are cool and pale with shiny skin and sparse hair growth. Pulses are weak in the lower extremities  with a notable absence of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Foot wounds are present with evidence of gangrene.   This patient's presentation  medical history  habits  and physical examination findings strongly point toward a case of critical limb ischemia. Considering her age  ethnicity  type 2 diabetes and history of smoking as risk factors  the presentation seems consistent with available literature on demographic representation in critical limb ischemia.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,5,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia - A Case Presentation  A) Demographic Information  The patient is a 74-year-old African-American male from a low socio-economic background. He resides in an urban area in the Midwest United States and has no stable employment.   B) Chief Complaint:  The patient presents with a six-month history of severe rest pain and non-healing wounds in the right foot. He reports consistent pain that gets worse at night and requires him to hang his foot over the edge of the bed. The pain has made it increasingly challenging for him to walk or perform basic daily activities.  C) Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant medical history which includes:  1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 15 years ago  irregularly controlled due to non-compliance with medication and poor dietary habits 2. Hypertension - Managed using pharmaceutic intervention but poorly controlled 3. Tobacco Use - Smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years but quit five years ago 4. Peripheral Arterial Disease - Diagnosed five years ago  managed conservatively 5. Stroke - Suffered a minor stroke six years ago with full recovery  D) Surgical History:  His surgical history is significant for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery ten years ago due to Coronary Artery Disease.  E) Family History:  The patient's father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 75  and his mother is a diabetic and hypertensive. His older brother succumbed to renal failure secondary to uncontrolled diabetes.  F) Social History:  He lives alone and occasionally gets help from his children. He has no regular exercise routine  a poor diet  and shows signs of social isolation.   In conclusion  this patient's complex history of chronic conditions  particularly poorly managed diabetes and hypertension  along with a history of tobacco use  points towards a broad cardiovascular risk profile. Despite his cessation of tobacco use  he is in an advanced stage of critical limb ischemia  an extreme form of peripheral arterial disease  which is common in elderly  African-American patients with his medical history.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,6,Patient Presentation: Presented here is a 78-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Anderson  who presented with intense pain in his left lower leg that began two weeks ago. Mr. Anderson is a retired construction worker who hails from Boston and lives with his wife in their family home.  His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years  current tobacco use (estimated 40 pack years)  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He has previously been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) three years ago.  Pain level escalated over time and is now described as severe  unrelenting  even at rest. His wife reported signs of skin discoloration on the foot (towards darker hues) and sores that seemed not to heal  as well as loss of hair on the affected leg. Furthermore  patient has reported difficulty in walking due to pain  also known as claudication. No reported loss of consciousness  chest pain  or dyspnea.   In summary  the history  demographics  and symptoms of Mr. Anderson's condition are highly suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  an advanced stage of PAD. Risk factors contributing towards this conclusion are age  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  current tobacco use  uncontrolled diabetes  and history of diagnosed PAD. It's advised to proceed with further diagnostics such as ankle-brachial index (ABI)  ultrasound  angiography  and/or MRI  and necessary multidisciplinary care involving vascular specialists  podiatrists  and if required  mental health professionals.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,7,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: - Name: Charles Brown - Age: 70 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired electrician - Residence: Philadelphia  PA  Brief History: Mr. Brown has recently been experiencing severe discomfort in his lower limbs  predominantly on his left side. He described the pain as a burning sensation  escalating at night  and often disturbing his sleep. He also reported non-healing ulcers on his left foot  which emerged about a month ago. His medical history reveals progressive functional decline in long-distance walking over the past six months.  He denies any history of trauma to the site  no recent travel or immobilization. No symptoms of chest pain  dyspnea  or palpitations.  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a well-documented history of smoking - approximately 20 cigarettes a day for nearly 50 years. He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 45  but it has been well-managed under medication for the past 25 years. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. The disease has had decent glycaemic control with diet and metformin.  Family History: There is a history of cardiovascular disease in his family; his father suffered a heart attack at the age of 62  and his elder brother was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) at the age of 65.  Assessment: Considering Mr. Brown's age  long-term smoking  diabetes  and hypertension  along with his persistent symptoms and family history of cardiovascular disease  he has a high likelihood of having developed Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which can significantly reduce blood flow to the extremities and carry a risk of amputation  if not treated promptly and properly.  Next Steps: Further diagnostic evaluations should include an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test and imaging studies  such as ultrasound or angiography. After confirming the diagnosis  a multidisciplinary approach including vascular surgeons  cardiologists  endocrinologists and wound care specialists should be undertaken for effective treatment planning which could range from medication to possible revascularization procedures.  In conclusion  early diagnosis and proper treatment are vital for improving the quality of life of patients suffering from CLI  especially in high-risk populations  such as long-term smokers and patients with hypertension and diabetes. Intensive disease management  coupled with lifestyle modifications and consistent follow-ups  can effectively reduce the progression of CLI and associated risks.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,9,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Profile:  Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Truck Driver (Sedentary lifestyle) Current Residence: Brooklyn  New York City  Presenting Complaint:   Mr. J is a 65-year-old African American male who is presenting with severe leg pain  especially during rest. He also reports non-healing sores on both legs for the past few weeks and his wife noticed that his legs frequently feel cold to the touch.   Past Medical History:  1. History of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. The patient has been non-compliant with his medication regimen and diet control.  2. Hypertension for 10 years  currently managed with daily Amlodipine 10mg.   3. Current Smoker: The patient admits to smoking around 15-20 cigarettes per day for approximately 35 years.   4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on Atorvastatin 20 mg daily  however  he admits to often forgetting to take his medication.   5. Family history: His father suffered from heart disease and his mother had a stroke.   6. Personal history: Sedentary lifestyle with minimum physical activity. The patient is also obese with a BMI of 34 kg/m2.   Impression:  Mr. J’s age bracket  gender  ethnicity  obesity  smoking history  uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  presence of peripheral vascular disease symptoms  and family history of cardiovascular diseases put him at an elevated risk for Critical Limb Ischemia. The patient's jobs as a truck driver indicates long hours of sitting and minimal physical activities that could further exacerbate his condition.  Plan:   Considering the patient’s worsening symptoms  vascular surgery consultation is warranted for further evaluation and management of his critical ischemia. Concurrently  a comprehensive  multidisciplinary approach to manage his diabetes  hypertension  and assist with his smoking cessation is also essential to mitigate his further risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,10,Slide 1:  Patient Presentation  - The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  presenting with rest pain in the lower limb and nonhealing wounds on his left foot for the last few weeks.  Slide 2:  Demographics  - Literature suggests that Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is more prevalent in patients above 60 years and varies by ethnicity. Our patient falls within the at-risk demographic  considering his advanced age and ethnic background.  Slide 3:  Medical History  - He is a former smoker  having quit five years ago after smoking 2 packs per day for over 30 years  a habit that significantly risks peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type 2  poorly controlled  rendering him a typical CLI patient.   Slide 4:  Symptoms and Examination  - The patient reported rest pain primarily at night  nonhealing ulcers on the toes  and the foot has a dusky appearance suggesting insufficient blood supply. He also experiences difficulties in walking distances  often stopping due to pain in his left calf muscles  classic symptoms of CLI.  Slide 5:  CLI and PAD Connection  - Majority of CLI patients have underlying PAD  which is associated with several risk factors such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia.  Slide 6:  Summary  - In conclusion  the 68-year-old African American male patient falls within the high-risk demographics for CLI. His former smoking habit  coupled with chronic conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia  further increases CLI risk. His lower limb rest pain  nonhealing ulcers  dusky foot appearance  and intermittent claudication make a strong clinical case for CLI.    End Slide:  Immediate next steps will include thorough diagnostic tests (such as Doppler ultrasound  angiography) and potential treatments focusing on relieving symptoms  improving limb function  stopping disease progression  and enhancing the general quality of life. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,11,Patient Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. Antonio Alvarez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the vascular clinic with a 2-week history of severe rest pain in his right leg  worsening ulcers  and signs of gangrene.  Past Medical History: Mr. Alvarez suffers from long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 50  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed 5 years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit upon diagnosis of PAD. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father dying from a stroke at age 80.  Current Medications: Mr. Alvarez has been prescribed Metformin for his diabetes and low-dose aspirin as an antiplatelet regimen for PAD. He also takes Lipitor (Atorvastatin) for his elevated cholesterol levels.   Prior Treatment History: He underwent revascularization intervention (angioplasty) for his PAD two years ago  but poor blood sugar control has led to disease progression.   Presentation: Upon examination  Mr. Alvarez shows signs of pallor and cyanosis in his right lower leg  with non-healing  painful ulcers on his toes and foot  indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He also complains of nocturnal pain  relieved only by hanging his leg over the bed.  Laboratory Tests: Glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c) and fasting glucose levels reflect poor diabetic control. Ankle-brachial index is reduced  hinting at significant arterial disease. A computed tomographic angiogram confirms extensive occlusive disease in the iliac  femoral  and popliteal arteries of the right leg.  Patient’s Context: Mr. Alvarez lives with his wife and is retired. He reports minimal daily physical activity  mainly due to his leg pain. His wife manages his diet  and he admits to struggling with dietary adherence and regular self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.   Demographic Overview: According to literature  Hispanics like Mr. Alvarez constitute 17% of patients diagnosed with CLI. The median age at presentation is typically in the seventh decade. Contributory factors such as smoking  diabetes  and hereditary propensity for cardiovascular disease are prominent in this patient group. Male patients have a slightly higher predilection for CLI than females.    Conclusion: Given his presenting symptoms  history  and investigations  Mr. Alvarez’s condition is consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia. Urgent vascular consultation is warranted for revascularization or possible amputation discussion  due to the advanced presentation. Additionally  structured education for better diabetes management is essential to prevent a recurrence in the future.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,13,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in Elderly Male Patient with Multiple Comorbidities  Presenting Patient: Mr. Johnson  an 84-year-old African American male  retired truck driver from Denver  Colorado  presents today with significant leg pain  especially prominent at rest  ulcerations on toes and severe decrease in mobility. His past medical history is notable for Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing for more than 15 years  alongside a history of smoking. These conditions have predisposed him to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with subsequent progression to critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Mr. Johnson has been struggling with a progressive decrease in mobility over the last 12 months. Although he initially experienced leg pain while walking short distances (claudication)  over the last couple months  his symptoms have worsened to include rest pain  particularly in his right foot. He has also been experiencing noticeable temperature differences between extremities and has lost significant weight.  Physical Examination: Upon inspection  there are multiple non-healing ulcers on the toes of his right foot. His right lower extremity is pale  atrophic  with delayed capillary refill. Noninvasive vascular studies indicated a severely decreased ankle-brachial index (ABI)  suggestive of PAD.  Management and Plan: Mr. Johnson has been referred to Vascular Surgery for revascularization intervention. The comprehensive management plan includes aggressive risk factor modification  including optimized control of his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  along with smoking cessation counseling.   In Summary: Population studies have shown that CLI most commonly affects elderly males with a history of diabetes  smoking habits and other cardiovascular risk factors. As Mr. Johnson is already managing multiple chronic conditions  including diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  he fits into that demographic. It is also worth noting racial disparities affect CLI presentation  with the incidence being particularly high among African American men. This case showcases the typical representation of a patient with CLI  highlighting the urgent need for aggressive management to prevent limb loss. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,14,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia: A Clinical Presentation  Patient Summary:   Patient AJ is a 70-year-old African-American male referred to our vascular outpatient clinic  presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). His chief complaints are significant pain in his left lower extremity  even during rest  and a non-healing foot ulcer present for several months.  Current Address: 45 Lakeside Drive  Baltimore  MD 34256  Demographics:   Our patient occupies a demographic with a high risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and subsequently CLI. Studies show an increased prevalence of PAD among African-Americans  with males and those above 69 years showcasing the most significant disease burden.  Source of Referral:   Referral from his primary care physician following the persistent symptoms and non-response to conservative treatment.  Past Medical History:   Patient AJ has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  contributing factors to his current PAD and CLI diagnosis. He is also a past smoker with 40-pack-year history  which further increases his risk for arterial diseases. Unfortunately  he also shoulder's familial history of cardiovascular diseases—his father passed away due to stroke  and his elder brother has coronary artery disease.  Family History:   Father: Deceased  cause of death– Stroke. Brother: Alive  diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease. Mother: Deceased  cause of death– Breast Cancer.  Social History:   The patient is a retired engineer living with his wife in a suburban community. He quit smoking 10 years ago but admits to excessive alcohol consumption with a habit of a pack of beer significantly every week.  Occupational History:   The patient enjoyed a long career as a civil engineer but has retired. His previous work involved moderate physical activity.  Medications:   1. Metformin 1000 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes  2. Losartan 50 mg daily for hypertension  3. Baby Aspirin 81mg daily   Patient AJ's presentation is typical for patients with critical limb ischemia  considering his demographic traits  unhealthy lifestyle choices  and a background of risk factors and associated conditions. His case highlights the importance of targeting modifiable risk factors and regular disease monitoring in high-risk individuals to prevent disease progression to this stage.   The immediate course of action for patient AJ should involve detailed diagnostic investigations  including ankle-brachial index  ultrasound scan  CT angiography  or MR angiography to assess the extent and severity of the disease. Depending on the findings  strategies may include aggressive risk factor management  endovascular intervention  bypass surgery  or in worst-case scenarios  amputation.   Simultaneously  it is critical to address his co-existing health conditions and unhealthy habits such as alcohol consumption  and patient education for disease management  to optimize his long-term health outcome.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,15,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male presents to the clinic today reporting severe lower extremity pain. In the United States  critical limb ischemia (CLI) is known to have a higher prevalence among the African American population  and Mr. Doe's demographic further presents an increased risk.  Address:  Mr. Doe lives alone in an urban area in New York City. Living circumstances matter because patients living in urban areas might have different risk exposure compared to those living in rural areas.   Social History:  He is retired  used to work in construction  and has been a heavy smoker for the past 40 years. Mr. Doe's history of heavy smoking is an important factor as smoking is a significant risk factor for CLI. He is moderate alcohol drinker and doesn't engage in regular exercise.  Past Medical History:  Significantly  Mr. Doe has a medical history of long-standing  poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both contributing factors towards development of CLI. He also has a history of intermittent claudication  coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia.   Family History:   Mr. Doe's father and grandfather both suffered from peripheral artery disease  suggesting a genetic predisposition to vascular disease.   Current medications:  Mr. Doe is currently on oral hypoglycemics  anti-hypertensives  statins  baby aspirin  and ticagrelor. His medications suggest a serious underlying cardiovascular disease.   Symptoms:  Mr. Doe describes the pain as a dull ache that worsens with any foot movement and is relieved with rest. He has also noted some superficial ulceration in his left foot  and a noticeable pallor in his toes compared to the rest of his feet. His pain  together with signs of tissue loss like ulceration and skin pallor  indicates a severe  progressive stage of CLI. He has also reported experiencing claudicating pain previously  but the pain has only increased in intensity lately  forcing him to seek immediate medical attention.   On examination  further investigations are required to assess the extent of CLI and to guide treatment options. Early detection of CLI is crucial to initiate timely treatment  prevent further complications and significantly improve Mr. Doe's quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,16,Slide 1: Introduction  We'd like to present the case of a 73-year-old African-American male named Mr. Johnson suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This demographic group tends to be disproportionately affected by peripheral artery disease and its severe form  CLI.  Slide 2: Clinical Presentation  Mr. Johnson has been experiencing rest pain in his right leg for the past three weeks  particularly at night. He has described this pain as a severe burning sensation in his foot and lower leg. Additionally  he reported non-healing ulcers on his right foot. Recent observation revealed pallor on elevation and dependent rubor on dependency.  Slide 3: Demographic Attributes  Mr. Johnson is a retired electronics technician  and he has been a smoker for over 40 years  which is a significant risk factor in CLI. He hails from an urban setting  which literature suggests might play a role in his disease. His family history revealed that his father suffered from heart diseases.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson has a history of type II diabetes and hypertension. He has been on Metformin and Lisinopril for the past 10 years. He experienced a myocardial infarction five years ago. His labs showed HbA1C of 7.9% implying poor glycemic control. He also has mild kidney disease with a GFR of 45 mL/min.  Slide 5: Summarization   In summary  Mr. Johnson is a high-risk patient for CLI due to several factors including age  race  long history of smoking  chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension  and positive family history of cardiovascular diseases. His other risk factor includes poor glycemic control and kidney disease.  The combination of these factors demands careful and expedited intervention to save the limb  manage pain  and improve his quality of life. These interventions involve lifestyle change  medication optimization  endovascular treatment  and in some cases  surgical bypass or amputation as a last resort.  Slide 6: Further Management   Further management of Mr. Johnson’s case will be discussed in our next presentation  detailing the complexities of making clinical decisions in the management of critical limb ischemia. The main aim will be limb salvage  reduction of cardiovascular events  and the improvement of Mr. Johnson's quality of life. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,17,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Presentation   Patient Overview:  The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male presenting to the vascular clinic with characteristic symptoms of critical limb ischemia. The patient reported a three-week duration of unrelenting rest pain in his lower extremities  primarily on his left leg  and sites non-healing ulcers on his left foot. This pain has inimical influences on his functional capacity and disruptive effects on his sleep patterns. As per the Rutherford classification  this presentation is classified as category 4 Critical Limb Ischemia.  Demographics:  Critical limb ischemia is common in elderly individuals  with a significantly high prevalence in the age group of 70-80 years. Our patient’s demographic profile aligns with the typical demographic trends seen in critical limb ischemia patients.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a significant past medical history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Hyperlipidemia. He also has a history of tobacco use  which he quit 5 years ago. There is a multiyear history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which has been managed with medication. These factors collectively contribute to the patient’s prominent risk profile for the development of critical limb ischemia  a severe manifestation of PAD.   In conclusion  the patient's age  racial background  male gender  smoking history  and presence of comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension corroborate with the recognized risk factors associated with critical limb ischemia. The forthcoming steps would comprise conducting a physical examination  an ankle-brachial index test  and request imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Management would be focused on risk factor modification  symptomatic relief  and restoration of blood flow to the affected limb to prevent amputation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,18,Title: A case presentation of a patient with critical limb ischemia  Introduction:  We present the case of a 70-year-old African American male suffering from critical limb ischemia.  Patient Profile:  Mr. X  a retired school teacher  resides in Birmingham  Alabama  with his wife. He relies on his pension for income and has a history of smoking  with about 30 pack-years. The patient is relatively sedentary due to increasing weakness and pain in his lower limbs.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient reports that his symptoms started approximately six weeks ago  mainly with a moderate  continuous  aching pain in his left lower leg  primarily affecting the calf area. The patient also reports an increasing intensity in rest pain  particularly when he lies down at night. Furthermore  he has noticed non-healing ulcers on his left foot  the most severe being on the great toe  accompanied by necrosis and gangrene.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a significant medical history. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus around ten years ago  which is currently inadequately controlled with Metformin. Additionally  he has hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  managed with Atorvastatin. He also has a history of a myocardial infarction five years ago.  Family History:  Mr. X's father died at the age of 65 years because of stroke. Moreover  his mother was a diabetic and died at the age of 78 due to complications of diabetes.  Conclusion: Taking into account the patient's symptomatology  past medical  and family history  he matches the demographic of patients most commonly afflicted with critical limb ischemia - elderly  African American males with a history of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  reflecting the relatively higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease within this group as identified in the literature. His smoking habit and sedentary lifestyle only increase his risk. Therefore  he requires immediate assessment and intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,19,Title: Patient Presentation: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Introduction: Mr. Alejandro Torres  a 75-year-old Hispanic male  presents with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower limb.  Residence and Socioeconomic Status: Mr. Torres resides in East Los Angeles  California  representing a population segment with an elevated risk of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease due to income levels  resources for health care  and other socioeconomic variables.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Torres reports experiencing excruciating pain in his foot  even while at rest. He's had increasing difficulty walking due to the pain and noticed the development of non-healing ulcerations on his foot.    Past Medical History: Our patient has a significant past medical history. Mr. Torres has been managing his Type 2 diabetes for over 20 years. He is a former cigarette smoker  with a 40-pack-year history which he quit 10 years ago. He was diagnosed with high blood pressure five years ago. Unfortunately  these factors place Mr. Torres at higher risk for developing vascular diseases such as critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Family History: Mr. Torres’ father had myocardial infarction at age 60  indicating a potential genetic predisposition to vascular diseases.   Lifestyle:  Mr. Torres retired 10 years ago from his job as a mechanic. Since then  he's had a sedentary lifestyle  with diet mostly consisting of high complex fatty foods  contributing to his obesity.  Diagnosis: The given symptoms  combined with his medical history  narrowed our diagnosis to critical limb ischemia. Confirmation of the diagnosis will occur with further imaging tests such as an angiogram  CT angiography  or MR angiography.  Conclusion: Our patient  Mr. Alejandro Torres  with a significant history of Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension  presenting with severe rest pain and foot ulcerations falls within the demographic most commonly afflicted with CLI  according to literature. His diagnosis of CLI is still pending confirmation from imaging tests. He will be counseled about potential treatments including medication  lifestyle changes  and possible surgical intervention.   Critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities  is a severe condition requiring immediate attention and therapy. Mr. Torres’ case highlights the importance of preventive measures  early detection  and prompt treatment of this debilitating disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,20,Title: A Case Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics: The subject is a 70-year-old African-American male  Andrew S. He is retired and lives with his wife in their home in Chicago. He is a former smoker who quit about 15 years ago but has a 20-pack year history. His diet typically includes home-cooked  traditional foods  generally low in fiber and high in fat.  Presenting Condition: Andrew was admitted to the hospital presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  characterized by severe and worsening pain in his right lower leg  particularly at night. He mentioned most of his pain is in his right calf and foot. Along with rest pain  the patient was also found to have ulceration on his right foot  localized to his big toe  and remained largely non-healing.  Past Medical History: Andrew has a significant history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed 5 years ago. He underwent angioplasty for his left lower limb occlusion three years back. He also has a history of myocardial infarction five years ago for which he was treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Habits: He used to have a pack a day smoking history which he quit 15 years ago. He consumes alcohol in a moderate quantity  typically 1-2 drinks per day.  Lifestyle and Social Factors: Andrew lives with his wife in a suburb of Chicago. He is fairly sedentary  with limited physical activities. His diet lacks sufficient fruits and vegetables and he has a preference for processed food  which could be contributing to his persistent health issues.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67. His mother is alive and well at 89. His younger brother has a history of PAD and angioplasty.  Management: Andrew's CLI represents a serious manifestation of the PAD that could lead to amputation if not managed properly. The focus will be to control his diabetes and hypertension  assist with the improvement of lifestyle changes  and consider invasive actions such as angioplasty or bypass surgery for restoring his lower limb blood flow.   This collective information provides a medical perspective of Andrew's condition. However  it is equally important to consider his emotional and mental well-being  family support  and his preference for treatments to provide holistic care.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,22,Title: Case Study of Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Presentation:  This case discussion concerns Mr. James Sanchez  a 69-year-old Hispanic male residing in Los Angeles  California. His BMI is 28  falling under the overweight category. He is a retired construction worker with a history of heavy smoking (40 pack-years)  which he quit five years ago.   Mr. Sanchez presents with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He first noticed recurring severe pain in his right lower extremity during rest. The pain  often disturbing his sleep  was initially managed with over-the-counter analgesics. However  his pain severity increased to an extent where he felt it unbearable even after taking prescribed medications. His family also observed a change in color in his right foot - transforming from a pinkish hue to a pallor  and subsequently  to a gangrenous change.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Sanchez has an extensive past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed at the age of 55. His blood glucose levels have been inconsistent  suggestive of poor glycemic control. He also suffers from systemic Hypertension  managed with a regular dose of lisinopril. He has a significant history of atherosclerotic disease  with a prior instance of Coronary Artery Disease  for which he underwent angioplasty. He has no history of renal disease  stroke  or previous peripheral artery disease (PAD).   Family history is significant for heart disease and diabetes on both maternal and paternal lines. His older brother had a heart attack at the age of 62 and his father had an ischemic stroke at the age of 70.  In short  our patient is a senior  diabetic  hypertensive  ex-smoker male with a significant past medical history. His set of risk factors includes age  ethnicity  diabetes  hypertension  smoking history  and atherosclerotic disease  which align with the global risk factors recognized for the development of critical limb ischemia.   Addressing his complaint of severe lower extremity pain with the discoloration changes  it is important to consider an urgent evaluation of his peripheral vascular system. Clinically  it appears to be a case of critical limb ischemia  but a definitive diagnosis can be made through vascular imaging studies.  Acknowledging his symptoms  risk factors  and past medical condition  an inclusive symptomatic management and potential advanced interventions need to be planned to prevent the progression of the disease and limb loss. Management should also involve aggressive risk factor modification to prevent the onset of future vascular events. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,23,Title: Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Patient   Good afternoon all   I will like to present a case of a 68-year-old male patient  Mr. Asher  of African-American ethnicity  who has presented today with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Mr. Asher has been living an active retired life in Brooklyn  NY  and is widowed. Prior to his retirement  he had been working in a steel manufacturing factory for over 40 years. He is a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago  but admits to consuming alcohol occasionally.  Past Medical History: Mr. Asher had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes approximately 20 years ago and has been managing his condition mainly with oral hypoglycemic agents. His blood glucose levels have often fluctuated  indicating poor management. He also has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with antihypertensive medications.  Upon initial physical examination  there is evidence of unhealing ulcers on the distal ends of his right leg  dry gangrene of the toes  and decreased pulses in the right lower limb – symptoms that are highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia. He has been experiencing intermittent claudication and rest pain over the last few weeks  which he initially attributed to old age.  His investigations have revealed low ankle-brachial index (ABI) readings  especially on the right side  which is consistent with the diagnosis of CLI. His blood reports show elevated glycemic indices  cholesterol  and triglyceride levels indicating poor control of his diabetes and possible dyslipidemia.  It is important to note that Mr. Asher’s case is not unique. Population studies have shown that CLI is predominant in geriatric patients over the age of 60  particularly those with a history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension  like Mr. Asher. His African-American ethnicity also puts him at a higher risk.  His preliminary management plan includes optimization of his diabetic and hypertensive status  wound care for the ulcers  and pain management. A vascular surgery consultation is also being considered for revascularization options to prevent the progression of the disease.  Thank you for your attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,24,Title: Patient Presentation for Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Introduction:  Our patient is Mr. Ramirez Martinez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male originating from Mexico but currently residing in California with open access to medical care. Mr. Martinez is a widower and a retired truck driver. Professionally  his work required extended periods of sitting  and personally  he admits to a sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary choices.  Presenting Symptom: Mr. Martinez is presenting with severe pain in his left lower limb  specifically the calf  consistent with rest pain  a classic symptom of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His pain is reportedly present even while at rest and often intensifies at night. Additionally  he described noticeable skin discoloration and coolness in the same limb.  Medical History: Mr. Martinez has an extensive past medical history. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus twenty years ago  which he manages with oral hypoglycemic agents and following a diabetic-friendly diet. However  he has poor compliance with his medications due to forgetfulness. His blood glucose levels are regularly high with HbA1c mostly above 7 percent. Mr. Martinez also suffers from Hypertension for the last fifteen years  which he controls with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Mr. Martinez is a former smoker and quit about ten years ago but smoked a pack a day for nearly thirty years. Furthermore  he has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a successful coronary artery bypass graft procedure eight years ago.   The demographic of the patient is relevant to his condition. Literature suggests that CLI is more common in older adults  and men are slightly more at risk than women  especially those with a history of smoking  diabetes  coronary artery disease  and hypertension.  Given this background  Mr. Martinez falls in the high-risk group for CLI. The current symptoms add to the suspicion  and further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and plan subsequent management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,25,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Case Presentation  Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 70-year-old African American male presenting with critical limb ischemia  specifically reflected in extended pain in his left calf  minimal wound healing  and gangrenous abnormalities. He reports severe rest pain for three months  especially while resting at night  further aggravated with elevation of the leg. The patient has a history of abrupt weight loss  pallor and weakness  decreased temperature of the left leg  and a noticeable reduction in the left peripheral pulse.   The patient is a lifelong resident of the rural South  which suggests potential healthcare disparities  including lack of access to quality healthcare services  that could have led to the delay in medical attention.   Demographic Information:  He is a retired factory worker  lives with his wife and five children in Mississippi. He reports a previous smoking history of 50 pack-years  alcohol abuse in the past  now abstaining  he is obese with a BMI of 31.5  a mostly sedentary lifestyle  and a diet high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables.   Past Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 diagnosed 25 years ago  poorly controlled  with recent HbA1c of 9.5% (normal range <5.7%). His other medical comorbidities include dyslipidemia  hypertension managed with lisinopril  and coronary artery disease for which he had coronary artery bypass graft surgery a decade ago. He also had stroke two years ago without residual deficits.   The patient’s medical history sketch  unfettered smoking habit  diet  and adverse lifestyle factors reflect the risk factors associated with poor peripheral artery disease management and high risk for critical limb ischemia. However  he is currently on aspirin  metformin  and atorvastatin to manage his existing health conditions.   The current focus is to evaluate the patient’s disease extent through further diagnostic investigations and manage the CLI. The potential treatment options are endovascular intervention or bypass surgery coupled with aggressive risk factor management. His case may further involve a multidisciplinary team including vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,26,Title: Patient Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  Good day everyone.  Today  we will discuss a classic case of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 70-year-old African American male from a semi-urban setting. He is a retired civil servant with about 1500 USD monthly retirement pay. He lives alone  occasionally receiving help from a visiting nurse. He is compliant with his medications and regularly communicates with his primary care physician.  Medical History:  The patient has a significant medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past two decades  currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He is also hypertensive for the last 15 years on 2-drug combination therapy. His longstanding smoking habit (40-pack-years) was quit around five years back  and he has a history of Coronary Artery Disease  which was managed with stenting about 8 years back. There is no family history of CLI or other peripheral arterial diseases.  Presenting Problem:  He reports rest pain in his right foot for the past two weeks  more pronounced at night  and relieved by hanging the leg down. He also reports a non-healing wound on his right big toe for a month with associated numbness and tingling in the foot. There's a notable intermittent claudication after walking less than a block. On closer examination  the foot appears pallid and cool with loss of hair growth. There is a painful ulcer around the dorsal aspect of the big toe.  Next Steps:  Considering the classic signs and symptoms  coupled with the patient's peripheral arterial disease risk factors such as advanced age  male gender  African American ethnicity  diabetes  hypertension  past smoking habit  and heart disease  he is highly suspicious for CLI. Further study  such as an Ankle-Brachial Index and angiography  would be utilized for the diagnosis confirmation and to decide the best mode of revascularization to improve blood flow if necessitated by the diagnosis.  Conclusion:  His case sends an essential reminder of the importance of early detection and management of common risk factors to prevent more severe forms of peripheral arterial disease such as CLI  which has a high risk of limb amputation and cardiovascular events.  Thank you!
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,27,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  I. Demographic Information  Patient's Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 Years Old Gender: Male Race: Hispanic Marital Status: Married Occupation: Retired civil servant  II. Medical History:  Mr. John Doe is a non-smoker and non-drinker. His past medical history is significant for Diabetes mellitus  controlled with medication for over 20 years; and he was diagnosed with hypertension last year  currently under medical management. There is a documented history of hyperlipidemia diagnosed five years ago  as well. He underwent coronary artery angioplasty ten years ago. His mother had peripheral arterial disease and his elder brother has a history of myocardial infraction.  III. Present Illness:  Mr. Doe reports recent worsening of his chronic pain in the right lower extremity  especially when lying flat  and there is some relief on hanging the foot in dependent position. He has noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right foot which has been present for the last 2 months. There is no fever  but he notes progressive weakness and decreased temperature in the right foot as compared to the left foot.    In conclusion  Mr. Doe  a 68-year-old Hispanic male with a known history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia was admitted with symptoms of critical limb ischemia - ischemic rest pain and a non-healing foot ulcer.  According to the demographic representation in literature  critical limb ischemia is more common in older individuals (60 years and above) and those of Hispanic ethnicity like our patient. Additionally  common risk factors include smoking  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and established coronary artery disease which are all present in John Doe's case. His clinical presentation is thus typical of critical limb ischemia. Immediate medical attention is needed to prevent limb loss.   References:  1.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,28,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Introduction: Today  we are presenting a case of a patient who presented at our clinic with symptoms suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  named Mr. Williams. He is a resident of Detroit  Michigan  and is retired  primarily leading a sedentary lifestyle. His BMI is 29.7  indicating obesity.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Williams came in with symptoms of severe pain at rest in his right lower extremity  especially in the foot  coupled with non-healing ulcers in the toes of the same foot. He describes the pain as a burning sensation  which is worse at night.   Past Medical History: Mr. Williams is a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 18 years and hypertension for 15 years  both conditions not optimally controlled. He also has a history of smoking two packs a day for 25 years but quit smoking eight years ago. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease.   It is known that CLI is more common in the older population  especially those with poorly controlled diabetes and a history of smoking. African American ethnicity  similar to our patient Mr. Williams  is also identified as a risk factor for peripheral arterial disease  which in turn is a risk factor for CLI.  In Mr. William's case  his CLI risk is likely elevated due to his age  race  poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension  obesity  and former smoking habits. His clinical presentation along with past medical history highly suggests critical limb ischemia  which will now be confirmed with further diagnostic tests. The management plan will be outlined based upon further investigations.   This case presentation illustrates the importance of invoking a high index of suspicion for CLI in patients with similar demographic and medical history  ensuring early detection for efficient clinical management.   In conclusion  prompt recognition and treatment of CLI  a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease  is crucial for preventing limb amputation and improving the overall quality of life in these patients. Regular follow-ups and strong emphasis on lifestyle modification are also crucial in managing such conditions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,29,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Profile  The patient under review  Mr. James Buckley  is an African-American male  aged 75 years old. He is a retired civil engineer and resides in Atlanta  Georgia  United States with his wife. The enclosure of demographic information conforms to the literature which reveals that CLI primarily affects the senior population and carries a higher prevalence among African-Americans.  Past Medical History  Mr. Buckley has an extensive medical history. He has been a smoker for over 50 years and has a sedentary lifestyle since retirement  which likely contributed to his past diagnosis of type II diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This is in accordance with the literature findings that CLI is often a complication of PAD and that smoking  diabetes  and sedentary lifestyle are significant risk factors.   For the past ten years  he has been on prescribed medication for blood sugar control and blood pressure management  with suboptimal blood pressure control. This is a relevant point as poor blood pressure control is a recognized risk factor for the development of CLI.   About five years ago  Mr. Buckley was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and underwent bypass surgery with stent placement—an event that has been linked to the onset of CLI.   Presenting Symptoms   Mr. Buckley has been experiencing increasingly severe pain in his right lower leg  even while at rest. He exhibits noticeable foot pallor and coldness to touch. The physical examination also revealed a non-healing wound on his right foot  consistent with the symptoms of CLI. His condition has tremendously affected his daily activities and reduced his mobility significantly.   CLI is an urgent medical concern typically observed in PAD patients that should be promptly addressed due to its threat to limb viability and patient's life. Severe pain at rest  non-healing wounds or gangrene are the most frequently observed symptoms of CLI  making Mr. Buckley's case a critical one.   In conclusion  Mr. James Buckley  an elderly patient with a significant past medical history and multiple risk factors presents with critical limb ischemia. A prompt assessment and initiation of comprehensive and aggressive treatment options are vital in providing successful clinical and functional outcomes in this complex presentation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,30,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  The patient  identified as Mr. Romeo Benitez  is a 72-year-old Hispanic male hailing from Texas. He is a retired construction worker  married with three children  and currently residing with his wife. He has a 35-year history of smoking  averaging a pack of cigarettes a day  and is classified as a moderate drinker. Mr. Benitez is fluent in both Spanish and English  completed high school education  and does not have a regular exercise routine.  Medical History:  Mr. Benitez has a significant medical history with Type II Diabetes  managed by metformin for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and is currently on lisinopril. Approximately five years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD)  having initially presented with intermittent claudication. He is on a regimen of clopidogrel for the same. Despite management  the PAD has shown progression  consistent with his recent complaints of severe pain in the right lower extremity  particularly at rest.   Presentation and Symptoms:  Mr. Benitez has been presenting with escalating pain in his right lower extremity  more severe in the foot  which has been disrupting his sleep. He also reports noticeable discoloration and reduced temperature of his right foot  compared to that on the left. He has been noticing intermittent sores on his foot that seem to be healing slowly. His tolerance for physical activity has reduced significantly in recent months due to worsening pain. His pain seems to be unresponsive to over-the-counter painkillers.   This clinical picture strongly points to a likely diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) caused by progressive PAD. CLI has been identified as the most serious form of PAD  with smoking  diabetes  and hypertension among the lead contributing factors.   The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention and was referred for detailed diagnostic tests to confirm CLI and establish the degree of vascular impairment. Appropriate treatment will commence based on the results of these tests.   This case underlines the significant role lifestyle factors play in the progression of vascular diseases and the necessity for vigilant monitoring in at-risk populations.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,32,Patient Presentation:  Good morning/evening everyone   Today  we are discussing Mr. John Miller  a 68-year-old African American male  who presents to our clinic with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The literature indicates that CLI heavily impacts individuals over the age of 60  and incidence is higher in males and African American populations.   Mr. Miller lives in a rural area of Georgia with his wife. He is a retired truck driver and has a 30-year history of tobacco and alcohol use.  On examination  Mr. Miller has noticeable rest pain in his right leg accompanied by ulcers on the foot that have not healed for the past three weeks. He also reports experiencing intermittent claudication that started several months ago. Additionally  he has numbness and paresthesia below his knee.  In his past medical history  Mr. Miller was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension 10 years ago  both conditions are currently being managed through medication. He also had a myocardial infarction two years ago  and thus has a history of myocardial disease. A carotid ultrasound performed last year revealed carotid artery stenosis  though no surgical intervention was required.   Mr. Miller appears to be a classical patient for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  given his age  sex  race  geographic location  tobacco use  and history of diabetes  hypertension  cardiovascular disease  and carotid artery disease  which are typical risk factors and comorbidities for CLI.  As current clinical guidelines suggest  Mr. Miller should be managed promptly to prevent significant morbidity and mortality related to CLI. Strategies should include managing his risk factors  careful wound care  revascularization techniques  and possibly amputation.   Therefore  further diagnostic tests and appropriate interventions will be initiated to prevent potential progression to limb loss and other associated complications. Our goal of treatment for Mr. Miller is to relieve his pain  heal his ulcers  prevent limb loss  and improve his overall quality of life.   Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer any questions or discuss our next steps in more detail.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,33,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: Today  we present the case of a 72-year-old African American male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  tobacco use  and hyperlipidemia  who presented with pain at rest in his right lower leg  worsening ulceration in the foot  and gangrene.  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a retired construction worker  lives with his wife  and belongs to the lower middle socioeconomic class. He is a native of urban Baltimore with limited access to healthcare facilities due to distance and economic constraints. He consumes alcohol socially and has a 50-pack year smoking history  which he quit five years ago.  Medical History:  Since diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  he has been on oral medication and insulin respectively. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugar levels is inconsistently performed due to access issues and financial considerations. He has had hyperlipidemia for the past ten years  managed on statins. Compression stockings were recommended following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency  but he discontinued their use due to discomfort.   Current Complaint:  Over the past three months  he noticed a progressive increase in right calf pain while walking  which relieved at rest. Starting a month ago  it began occurring at rest as well. Around the same time  he noticed a non-healing ulcer on the right foot along with color changes  leading to gangrene.   Clinical Examination:  On examination  there is a gangrenous area on the right big toe with surrounding erythema and a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum of the foot. There are diminished peripheral pulses in the right lower limb and a decrease in temperature compared to the contralateral side  indicative of poor perfusion.   Summary: This 72-year-old patient  with several risk factors such as long-standing diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use history is presenting with rest pain  non-healing ulcer  and gangrene – a typical presentation of critical limb ischemia. Prompt diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are essential to prevent limb loss and address associated mortality and morbidity.   References: • Varu  V. N.  Hogg  M. E.  & Kibbe  M. R. (2010).

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,34,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. T. Roberts  currently residing in North Carolina. He is a retired industrial worker and has a bit of a smoking history. The patient is married with 6 children  all of whom are well settled and in good. He lives with his wife and they manage routine activities without assistance. Mr. Roberts has a previous medical history of chronic kidney disease  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)  a common predisposing factor for Critical Limb Ischemia.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department due to severe pain in his right lower limb  which has been progressive for the past few weeks. The pain has been persistent even at rest  and particularly worse during the night  disturbing his sleep. He also reported non-healing sores on the same foot and a noticeable decrease in temperature of the right compared to the left foot.   Past Medical History: Mr. Roberts has been diabetic for the past 20 years and is on oral medication for it. However  his control over sugar levels has waned in the recent past. He has been hypertensive for the past 15 years but maintained a relatively controlled blood pressure under medication. He was diagnosed with early-stage chronic kidney disease three years ago.   Mr. Roberts had been diagnosed with PAD eight years back. Despite lifestyle modifications and recommended lower limb exercises  his condition seems to have worsened.   Family and social history: There is a family history of heart disease; both his father and grandfather suffered from myocardial infarction. His two elder brothers have diabetes and one has PAD  making the patient's condition likely influenced by hereditary factors. He had been smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day for the last 50 years. He quit smoking five years ago  yet the damaging effects seem to have persisted.  Assessment: The clinical presentation  the ongoing uncontrolled diabetes  and PAD contribute to a likely diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. Guidelines recommend a more detailed evaluation including Ankle-Brachial Index measurement  Doppler ultrasound  and angiography to confirm the diagnosis and plan further management.   The patient's quality of life is a major concern with the current severity of symptoms. The management plan will be designed to control the pain  heal the sores  improve functional capacity  and prevent limb amputation. All the while  due attention will be given to control the potential comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,35,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  I. Introduction: Today  we will be discussing a case presentation of a 72-year-old African American male patient  known as Patient X  presenting with critical limb ischemia.  II. Demographic Information: Patient X is a retired police officer currently residing in urban Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. He lives with his wife and is being financially supported by his pension. He is a non-smoker.   III. Past Medical History: Patient X has a significant medical history of long-standing Type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with Metformin and Insulin in the past 25 years  complicated with diabetic neuropathy; hypertension which is managed with Lisinopril since the past 10 years; and hyperlipidemia for which he takes Atorvastatin for the past 15 years.  IV. History of Present Illness: In the past few months  Patient X has been experiencing intermittent claudication  especially upon walking short distances. Over the last week  he has complained of rest pain in the distal his right lower limb particularly at night. His wife recently noticed a non-healing ulcer on the tip of his right great toe.  V. Family History: Patient X's father died from myocardial infarction  and his elder brother is living with peripheral artery disease.  VI. Conclusion: Given his symptoms  demographics  longstanding uncontrolled diabetes  and family history  the provisional diagnosis is CLI  which is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease. CLI is more prevalent in the African American population compared to other ethnic groups  especially in people over 70 years. A more detailed evaluation is recommended for confirmation and subsequent intervention.    This case underscores the importance of timely detection of risk factors and early intervention to prevent debilitating complications  like CLI in a high-risk population such as African American elderly males with longstanding diabetes and hypertension. The patient's quality of life gets severely impacted due to pain and limited mobility  underscoring the need for comprehensive patient education and aggressive risk factor management in these patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,36,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile:   Mr. James Ford is a 72 years-old African American male. He lives in Bronx  a densely populated borough in New York City and is a retired construction worker. He has a history of smoking for over 30 years but quit 10 years ago.  Clinical History & Co-Morbidities:  Mr. Ford has been battling uncontrolled high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes for the past 18 years. His medical history also reveals that he has been on treatment for coronary artery disease for the past five years  and peripheral artery disease that was diagnosed two years ago. Unfortunately  he has not maintained consistent medication adherence or lifestyle modification efforts. He has a body mass index of 30 indicating obesity  which adds another layer of complexity to his health status.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Ford presented with a severe  persistent pain in his right leg even when resting  commonly experienced as a symptom of critical limb ischemia. The pain has been affecting his sleep for the past two weeks. Besides  upon physical examination  the doctor noted that the patient's right foot was cold to touch with very feeble and barely palpable pulse below the knee. There are also visible non-healing sores on his right foot  and the skin is changing color  showing sign of ischemia.  Relevant demographic information:   According to literature  the prevalence of peripheral artery disease and chronic limb-threatening ischemia is higher in men  increases sharply with age  and is also more prevalent among African Americans. Mr. Ford’s male sex  advanced age  and African American background place him in a higher risk category  thereby validating the demographic prevalence outlined by scholarly articles. The prevalence of peripheral artery disease  critical limb ischemia  and consequential amputation is higher among smokers and individuals with high blood pressure  diabetes  high cholesterolemia which are all present in Mr. Ford’s medical history.  In summary  Mr. Ford  a 72-year-old African American male with a significant past medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and coronary artery disease  alongside a history of smoking  presented with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia. His presentation is in line with demographic trends and risk factors indicated by literature. He requires immediate medical attention to prevent deterioration and possible limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,37,Patient Presentation  Alice Johnson  a 72-year-old African-American female  presents with a chief complaint of severe rest pain in her right lower extremity  which she reports has been ongoing over the past three weeks. Ms. Johnson lives independently in a nearby suburb and leads a relatively inactive lifestyle. She is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history  quit 10 years ago. She is a widow  with two adult children living out-of-state.   In terms of her past medical history  Ms. Johnson is known to have co-morbidities including hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  which is poorly controlled as indicated by her recent HBA1C score of 9.2%. She also has a 14-year history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that has been managed conservatively to date. The patient undergoes regular follow-ups at the cardiology clinic due to her diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure three years ago. There is no known history of cerebrovascular incidents or renal diseases in the past.  Ms. Johnson presents with critical limb ischemia  confirmed by an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) of 0.45 in the right lower limb. She reports severe  unrelenting pain while resting  which has interrupted her sleep for the past couple of weeks. Also  noticeable non-healing ulcers were noted over the anterior aspect of her right foot.  Her heightened pain  inability to walk  and ulceration suggest an imminent risk of limb loss if not addressed promptly and appropriately. Given the complexity and severity of this patient's condition  an urgent vascular surgical consultation is recommended  taken into account that surgical revascularization or endovascular intervention could be potential approaches towards achieving limb salvage based on further diagnostic testing. Meanwhile  optimization of her diabetes and hypertension should be a priority.  This patient’s demographic representation aligns with literature surveys suggesting the highest prevalence of critical limb ischemia among the elderly  diabetic individuals  and those with a history of smoking. Additionally  black populations are reported to have a higher prevalence as compared to their white counterparts. It's crucial to note that quick response and appropriate intervention are key to reduce the morbidity associated with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,38,Patient Presentation:   We have Mr. Robert Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presents today with severe and worsening leg pain that he describes as persistent over the last 6 weeks. Most notably  the pain has become constant even at rest  leading to disturbed sleep pattern. He also reports discoloration of the toes  chills and a sense of numbness in the affected limb. Mr. Smith also has a history of type II Diabetes Mellitus without complications  and has been actively managing it using metformin tablets for the past ten years. Further  he is a previous smoker for over 30 years with a 20 pack-year history. He quit about five years ago. No known history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  coronary artery disease  or stroke.  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) risk factors are well documented in the literature. Specifically  diabetes mellitus and smoking have been proven to increase the risk of CLI. Given that our patient has a history of long term smoking and prolonged diabetes  this has likely contributed to his current condition. Mr. Smith's presentation of rest pain  absence of pulse  presence of non-healing ulcers and discoloration aligns with typical symptoms of critical limb ischemia as stated in many studies.   His demographic profile is also in line with available statistical data. CLI  according to the literature  is most common in Caucasian males aged 50 to 70 years. Specifically  CLI is suspected to occur in up to 10% of men and 5% of women by age 70. Furthermore  a majority of CLI patients have a history of smoking and diabetes  further correlating with Mr. Smith's background.   In summary  Mr. Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of long-term smoking and diabetes  presents with symptoms corresponding with critical limb ischemia. His demographic profile and health history align with the reported risk factors for the disease. Therefore  from current observations  there is a high likelihood that he is suffering from critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic investigations and confirmatory tests such as duplex ultrasonography  CT angiography  or MR angiography will need to be conducted to establish definitive diagnosis and treatment course.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,39,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male from Chicago  Illinois  with a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes. He is a retired factory worker with Medicare insurance. He has a past medical history of hypertension and has been a smoker for over 50 years  consuming 15-20 cigarettes daily.   History of the Present Illness: The patient reported a four-month history of ongoing and worsening pain in his left lower limb  especially the foot  even while at rest. Pain has been severe enough to wake him from sleep. He also mentioned experiencing fatigue during short walks and constant numbness in his left foot. Physical examination showed marked pallor and cyanosis  reduced skin temperature  decreased pulse rate in left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis artery with an ABI index of 0.45  and presence of non-healing ulcers on his left foot with signs of gangrene on one toe.  Past Medical History: Patient has a long-standing history of type-2 diabetes (HbA1c - 9.0%) and hypertension with an average blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg over the past 5 years  both treated with oral medications. He completed a program for smoking cessation ten years ago but relapsed within two years. In addition to this  he has hyperlipidemia and has previously been hospitalized for angina pectoris.   Family and Social History: His father died from a heart attack  and his mother has a history of stroke. One of his siblings has type 2 diabetes. He is a widower living alone  with two adult children providing support. He has a history of alcohol consumption but stopped approximately five years ago. His diet is low in fresh fruits and vegetables due to financial constraints.  In conclusion  the patient’s current symptoms  clinical signs  and past medical history suggest that he is suffering from advanced peripheral artery disease  manifesting as critical limb ischemia. His history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension and hyperlipidemia have likely contributed to the development of this condition. Immediate intervention is required to prevent further complication and possible limb amputation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,40,Title: Patient Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile: We have a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient currently residing in a suburban neighborhood in New York. He is retired  previously worked in construction  and a heavy smoker with a 50-pack year history. He is married  has three children  and is of middle socio-economic status.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient complaints of severe pain in his left foot  which he describes as a rest pain. The pain increases during the night  preventing him from getting a decent night’s sleep. There is associated discoloration of his foot  it appears much paler compared to his right foot. Additionally  he notices that it feels much colder to touch  and there are non-healing wounds on his lower leg and foot.  Past Medical History: He has a long history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for around 25 years. His HbA1c level is 7.5%  indicating poor glycemic control. He also has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and a previous MI about 7 years ago that was managed conservatively. He reports arterial claudication for the past two years but never sought medical attention for it.  Social History: He is a heavy smoker  consumes alcohol moderately  and has a diet rich in fats  salts  and carbohydrates. His exercise history is suboptimal and he acknowledges the need to improve this. There is no reported history of illicit drug use.   Family History: His father died of stroke at the age of 67 and his mother has hypertension. One of his brothers has coronary artery disease.  Based on the patient’s constellation of symptoms  including rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and lower limb discoloration  in addition to his medical and social history  a working diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is suspected. This diagnosis is supported by his high-risk demographic: older age  male gender  Caucasian race  and above all  his cumulative vascular risk factors such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. Through this case  we understand the pressing clinical urgency of CLI and the importance of immediate and aggressive management to potentially save the limb and improve quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,41,Title: Presentation of a Patient With Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male hailing from a low socioeconomic status environment. Data shows that CLI tends to be more prevalent in black and low-income populations.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a six-month history of severe and constant leg pain  especially at rest  which is attributable to CLI. The pain is localized in his foot and calf  even escalating during the night. Skin discoloration and coldness of the limb have also been reported  along with noticeable sores and ulcers on his lower extremities that are not healing.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of cardiovascular diseases  including hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which he was diagnosed with eight years ago. He also has a 40-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes daily and sporadic alcohol use. His diet is high in cholesterol and he leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Diabetes Mellitus Type 2  hyperlipidaemia  and chronic kidney disease due to long-term hypertension are other notable conditions in his health record. Moreover  he had an episode of stroke two years ago  followed by full recovery.  Family History: According to genetic predisposition  it's salient to mention that his family has a history of cardiovascular diseases  specifically atherosclerosis  which heavily influences the patient's own health status. Both his father and elder brother had also suffered from PAD at later stages of their lives.  In conclusion  considering the patient’s background  lifestyle habits  extended history of smoking  chronic diseases (especially PAD  hypertension  diabetes)  and his recent symptoms  the possibilities of leg amputation or fatality in the next year are high if he doesn't get immediate  effective intervention for the critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,42,Patient Presentation:  We have a 70-year-old African-American male patient with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He is a chronic smoker with a 40-pack year history. He currently resides in an urban setting and is retired.   Health History:  The patient has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes for over 20 years  which has been challenging to manage. He has hypertension controlled with medication. He has atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with prior myocardial infarction treated successfully with percutaneous coronary intervention. He reports occasional angina  which is controlled with nitroglycerin as needed. The patient has dyslipidemia treated with a statin. The patient has a 10-year history of intermittent claudication in both legs  progressively worsening over the years.   Current Presentation:  The patient presents with a two-day history of non-healing ulcers on his right foot and extreme pain in his right leg  especially at rest. On physical examination  his right foot is significantly colder than the left  with absent pulses. The toes of the right foot are cyanotic  and there are two shallow ulcers on the right foot along with dry gangrene of the distal toes. The patient reports a significant decrease in mobility due at least in part to this pain.  The demographics  smoking history  complex medical history involving long-standing diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and the location of the pain and ulcers are all highly suggestive of CLI. Given the severity of the symptoms  this patient is at high-risk for limb amputation and requires urgent revascularization.  Literature Data:  CLI predominantly affects individuals over the age of 60. It tends to be more common in males and African-Americans due to a higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in these groups. Moreover  this patient's risk factors including smoking  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  cardiovascular disease history  contribute significantly to developing CLI.   In conclusion  this 70-year-old smoker with long-standing diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is an accurate demographic representation of a patient presenting with CLI. If action is not taken immediately  his quality of life could significantly decrease  and the risk for major amputation will rise.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,43,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 76-year-old African-American male.  Residence: 1312 Baker Street  Norfolk  Virginia  Demographics:  African-American males have at least a two-fold higher risk of peripheral arterial disease and CLI compared to their Caucasian counterparts  as reported in the literature. The increased risk is attributed largely to higher rates of cigarette smoking  hypertension and diabetes in this population.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a significant past medical history. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ten years ago and is currently managing it with Metformin. Over the years  he has struggled with his blood glucose levels which occasionally skew above the normal range.  He has been hypertensive for over fifteen years and takes Lisinopril daily. Despite medication  his blood pressure readings often fall in a prehypertensive range.  In addition  he has a 35-year history of heavy smoking but quit 5 years ago. He admits to social drinking but denies illicit drug use.  About 3 years ago  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3  likely secondary to his diabetes. His kidney function has been stable with regular follow-ups with his nephrologist.  He has a family history of early-onset coronary artery disease  with his father passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.  Current Complaint:  Mr. Johnson has been experiencing intermittent claudication for the last 2 years  primarily when he walks more than a block. However  for the last couple of weeks  he complains of increasing pain and numbness in his right lower leg  even when at rest. He reports that his foot often feels cold and he has recently noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe.  These symptoms suggest the progression of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The presence of the non-healing wound  pain at rest and reduced mobility clearly demonstrates the severity of the disease and indicates the need for prompt intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,44,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: Today  we will explore a case of a patient who presented with critical limb ischemia. This condition is the most severe clinical manifestation of peripheral artery diseasee  affecting 500-1000 people per million annually.  Patient Profile: The patient is a 64-year-old African American male from an urban demographic in the US. He has an established history of systemic hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus and is a former smoker for 30 years. He was previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease two years ago and been able manage his condition using prescribed medication. The patient also admits to being physically inactive due to his profession as an office clerk.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department with reports of severe pain in his right lower limb  especially at rest. He also complained of numbness and color changes to the affected limb  indicating possible poor circulation.   History of Present Illness: Over the last three weeks  he has experienced notable escalation in the intensity of pain  ultimately affecting his mobility and sleep. He also noticed foot sores that were slow to heal and developed ulcerations in the right limb.  Family History: The patient's father had a history of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. There are no other significant family medical issues.   Summary: With the patient's progressive symptoms  long-standing risk factors  and relevant family history  the presentation strongly suggests a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  an advanced state of peripheral arterial disease.   Further diagnostic assessments are warranted to confirm this diagnosis and to explore the appropriate therapeutic interventions  keeping the patient's overall health status  age  and lifestyle in consideration. A multidisciplinary approach involving a vascular surgeon  diabetologist  and physiotherapist may be beneficial in managing the complexity of CLI in this patient.   This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and management of underlying risk factors for peripheral arterial disease and CLI to prevent fatal cardiovascular events and limb amputations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,45,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile:   Our index patient is Mr. A  a 70-year-old African-American male presenting with severe  chronic pain at rest in his left lower extremity  particularly in the calf and foot region  along with skin discoloration and poor wound healing on the foot. Ethnicity is significant because  as literature documents  peripheral artery disease and  therefore  critical limb ischemia  are more common and severe among African-Americans.     Medical History:   Mr. A has a long-standing history of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both poorly controlled  despite being prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensive medications. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia. This suite of risk factors is consistent with literature that lists atherosclerosis  caused by diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and smoking  as the main etiological factor in over 90% of critical limb ischemia cases.    Mr. A experienced intermittent claudication in the affected limb for over a year  indicative of peripheral artery disease progression. In the past six months  the pain has become intense and constant  suggestive of the advancement to critical limb ischemia.  Physical Examination:   Physical exam reveals a palpably cold  pulseless left lower extremity with notable pallor and cyanosis. There are multiple non-healing ulcers  the most severe being a full-thickness ulcer on the heel. Pedal pulses are not detected through palpation or Doppler ultrasound.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Given the physical findings and medical history  the clinical diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made. To confirm and further evaluate the extent of the disease  angiographic imaging will be carried out.  Treatment:   Immediate treatment aims to reduce pain and salvage the limb  which involves balancing medication for related comorbidities  revascularization procedures  local wound care  and lifestyle modifications with the possible need for surgical intervention or endovascular therapies.  This presentation showcases a typical patient with critical limb ischemia  a condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality  emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce the risk of limb loss and improve prognosis.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,46,Subject: Presentation of an aged patient with critical limb ischemia  I. Patient Demographics: The patient is Mr. X  a 76-year-old Caucasian male  non-smoker  who is a retired banker. He is a widower currently living with his daughter and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   II. Chief Complaint: Mr. X reports constant rest pain in his right lower extremity over the past several weeks. The pain got aggravated in the last few days and is not relieved by rest. He expresses difficulty in sleeping due to pain. There is a noticeable color change in his foot which is of considerable concern to him.  III. Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history consists of past CAD (Coronary Artery Disease)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  pre-diabetes  and intermittent claudication. He underwent coronary bypass surgery around ten years ago. Mr. X is in compliance with his prescribed medications including aspirin  a beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and statin for his heart disease  and metformin for his pre-diabetic status.  IV. Epidemiological Consideration: Studies show that older individuals  especially those with a history of heart disease and diabetes  are more prone to critical limb ischemia (CLI). The typical population with CLI usually consists of elderly males like Mr. X. The history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heart conditions further elevates his risk.   In conclusion  Mr. X's symptoms point towards Critical Limb Ischemia with possible progression to tissue loss  given skin discoloration. It is essential to manage his condition urgently to prevent its severe implication  including loss of mobility or worse  resulting in amputation. His present condition should be conveyed to a vascular surgeon without delay for further evaluation and revascularization options to save the limb. Wound care and foot care education  along with his ongoing management for his co-existing conditions  should also be continued.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,47,Title: Patient Presentation in Critical Limb Ischemia   Demographics: The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Benjamin Thornberry  retired  living with his wife in Central Florida. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history and a moderate alcohol consumption history.  Presenting Situation: Mr. Thornberry presents complaining of severe rest pain in his left leg  describing it as a burning or cramping sensation  particularly during night time. He rates the pain as 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain  which had been intermittent l over the past few months  has increased markedly in the last week. This pain has been causing sleep disturbances  greatly affecting his quality of life.  Past Medical History: Proper review of systems was conducted and a thorough past medical history was collected. Mr. Thornberry has been diagnosed with long term Type-2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on metformin therapy for eight years and controls his condition via diet. He also has a 10-year history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 7 years ago and takes daily statins. Furthermore  he had myocardial infarction five years ago  which was managed by coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.  Family History: He has a noticeable family history of cardiac diseases  with his father dying from a stroke at the age of 68 and mother from congestive heart failure at 70.  Social History: He is a retired factory worker and now lives a sedentary lifestyle. He has been a smoker but quit five years ago following his heart attack. He consumes alcohol moderately.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  his left leg appeared pale and cold with notable hair loss and shiny skin  indicative of poor blood supply. A weak pulse in the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries was palpated. In terms of sensory examination  numbness was present in the distal part of his left leg.  This patient’s presentation is highly symptomatic of Critical Limb Ischemia  correlating with his demographic details and past medical history. He needs immediate management and intervention to prevent serious complications such as stroke or potential loss of the affected limb.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,48,Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Good Morning/Afternoon Everyone   Today we are going to discuss a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Patient is a 72-year-old African American male  named Mr. Williams. He has been experiencing gradually progressive pain in his left lower extremity for the past several months. He reported that the pain significantly worsens during physical activities such as walking  and relieves partially with rest. However  recent onset of rest pain and development of non-healing wounds on his foot prompted his visit.  Mr. Williams' past medical history is significant. He has been previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension  which are under control with medication. He also been diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease two years ago. He's a retired construction worker  and has a 40-pack a year history of smoking  although he quit 10 years ago.  Family history revealed that a couple of his family members also had Cardiovascular diseases. His mother had a stroke in her late 70s and his father had suffered a heart attack in his mid-70s. He denied any history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse.  His demographic profile and history makes him representative of the typical CLI patient as described in literature. Majority of patients with CLI are elderly males with a history of smoking  diabetes and hypertension predisposing to atherosclerosis  and African Americans are disproportionately affected.   These risk factors paired with his lifestyle have likely contributed to his CLI. The combination of underlying peripheral artery disease  uncontrolled diabetes  and hypertensive vascular damage can accelerate the progression of this ischemic condition.  In summary  it is imperative to manage Mr. Williams' risk factors aggressively and consider appropriate vascular interventions in order to ensure limb salvage and improve his quality of life  considering the debilitating nature of CLI.   Thank you.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,49,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Demographics:   The patient is a 74-year old African-American male  retired from a long career in construction work. He has a history of heavy smoking and lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle in an urban area. He is married with 4 adult children and hails from a lower-middle-class socioeconomic background.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a longstanding record of multiple comorbidities associated with the onset of critical limb ischemia. He has been a smoker for the past 50 years and has a history of hypertension  which is not well controlled despite medication. Additionally  he has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents for the past 15 years.   He also has some degree of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  but he has never been hospitalized for this condition. His other past medical issues include a myocardial infarction 8 years ago  for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)  and he is currently on long-term aspirin and statin therapy.  Family history reveals his father suffered from end-stage renal disease  believed to be due to untreated hypertension. His elder brother passed away from stroke 5 years ago.   No history of substance abuse or any psychiatric illness.  Patient is currently experiencing worsening pain in his right lower limb  which initially only occurred after physical activity but is now present even during rest. There is also noticeable skin discoloration and coldness of the feet  with slow healing of sores on his foot. He reports experiencing recent weight loss and reduced appetite.  Critical limb ischemia represents an advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease  primarily linked with smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and advancing age. The patient's profile aligns with populations commonly affected by this debilitating condition. It is important to promptly treat and manage his illness to prevent further complications  which could include amputation or even death.   His ongoing care should involve a team of healthcare professionals  including a primary care doctor  a cardiologist  a vascular surgeon  a podiatrist  a dietitian  and a diabetes specialist  underscoring the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach for optimal patient care in Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,50,Title: A Case Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia   Introduction:  We present the case of Mr. John A. Smith  an 71-year-old  Caucasian male who reported to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe pain in his left leg. Mr. Smith is a former marine mechanic and hails from Ontario  Canada  which is also where is currently resides. The patient demographic information aligns with the prevalent literature highlighting that critical limb ischemia (CLI) is more prevalent in elderly men  particularly those above 65.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is a former smoker having smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. He also has a history of long-standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents for approximately 15 years. His control of diabetes has been relatively poor with a recent HbA1c level of 8.2%.  Additionally  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years. He also has a history of Dyslipidemia  and hyperuricemia for which he is receiving treatment. A cardiac assessment performed five years ago denoted presence of moderate atherosclerotic heart disease but no episodes of myocardial infarction have been reported. He underwent coronary angioplasty two years ago.   Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Smith arrived at the ED with severe rest pain  which had been bothering him for the last two weeks and had markedly increased during the last 48 hours. The pain was described as a sharp  aching sensation mainly located in his lower leg and foot. He also reported skin discoloration  coldness of the leg  and noticed a non-healing wound on his left foot. He was also experiencing intermittent claudication over the past few months  which causes pain on walking but relieved upon rest.  Preliminary Assessment:  On initial physical examination  his left foot appeared pale  cold to touch and there was a noticeable decrease in the left pedal pulse. A non-healing ulcer was observed on the heel of his left foot.   Conclusion:  Given the clinical history  physical examination results  and his risk factors (advanced age  male  former smoking  hypertension  heart disease  and poorly controlled diabetes)  Mr. Smith fits the classic presentation of a patient with critical limb ischemia. Further investigations have been done to confirm the diagnosis like Ankle-brachial index  Doppler Ultrasonography  CT angiography  and MR angiography. Upon confirmation  prompt treatment will be initiated which may include medical therapy  revascularization (surgery or angioplasty) or amputation in case of extensive tissue loss.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,51,Patient Presentation   I am presenting a case of a 68-year-old Hispanic Male  Mr. Roberto Diaz  who presented with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia.   Mr. Diaz is a retired construction worker and has been living in California for over 40 years. He has been married for 45 years and lives with his wife. They have 3 children  all adults.    His past medical history reveals that he is a chronic smoker  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for about 22 years  and has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for ten years. Reports also reveal Mr. Diaz underwent coronary angioplasty six years ago to treat his coronary artery disease. He also underwent bilateral cataract surgery four years ago.  Mr. Diaz presented with complaints of rest pain in his left leg accompanied by non-healing ulcers on his foot for the past three months. He described the pain as severe  unrelieved by rest  causing him distress  especially at night.   On examination  his left foot appeared pale with reduced temperature. Palpable absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the left foot were observed. His ankle-brachial index was decreased  which is indicative of arterial insufficiency.   Mr. Diaz's current medications include Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and aspirin for prophylaxis. All medications are reported to be well-tolerated. He does not report any known allergies.   The preliminary diagnosis based on his clinical history  symptoms  and physical examination are consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia  likely due to peripheral artery disease  a common complication in people with his history of chronic smoking  long-term diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease. Early intervention is essential to prevent possible limb amputation. Therefore  I recommend further vascular evaluation and treatment by the appropriate vascular specialist.   His social history further confirms his risk for this condition. He has been a smoker for 40 years and has a diet that is characteristic of Hispanic/Latino cultures  which can sometimes be high in fats and carbohydrates  contributing to his hyperlipidemia and diabetes management.   To conclude  Mr. Diaz is a 68-year-old Hispanic male with comorbidities of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of a coronary artery disease who presents with all the classic signs of critical limb ischemia. His chief complaint of rest pain and presence of foot ulcers underlines the severity of arterial insufficiency and immediate need for comprehensive vascular evaluation.  
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,52,Patient Presentation:  Today we are discussing a 75-year-old African American female  Mrs. Selena Jenkins  presenting with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Mrs. Jenkins is a retired school teacher living in a suburban neighborhood in Alabama. She lives with her husband and is visited often by her grown children and grandchildren. She presented at the clinic today complaining of severe pain in her left leg that is consistent even at rest. In addition to this pain  she has also reported experiencing ulcers and sores on the same leg that have not healed in over 20 days. It is worth noting that Mrs. Jenkins has been a smoker for 50 years  which  along with her advanced age  puts her at a higher risk for CLI.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Jenkins has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and peripheral artery disease. All these conditions are acknowledged risk factors for CLI and have been managed with medication for the last 15 years. Moreover  Mrs. Jenkins has a history of dyslipidemia  managed with statins  which also contributes to her risk for CLI.   In conclusion  Mrs. Jenkins represents a typical demographic seen with CLI  an elderly individual who has had prolonged exposure to risk factors like smoking and a significant history of diseases like hypertension and diabetes. The unhealed sores and consistent pain in her leg are concerning and correlate with her CLI diagnosis.    Moving forward  her treatment warrants aggressive management of her diabetes and hypertension and drastic lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation along with necessary revascularization procedures.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,53,Title: Pediatric Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient's Name: Confidential (Data Protection Norms) Gender: Male Age: 14 years Race: Caucasian Place of Residence: Detroit  Michigan  Case Presentation:   The patient  a 14-year-old Caucasian male  residing in Detroit  Michigan  presents with a 2-week history of severe rest pain in the right lower limb. He lives with his parents and two siblings. He is an active middle school student who enjoys soccer and part-time gardening work.   He reports a history of progressive pain that worsens at night affecting his sleep significantly. The patient complained of numbness and coldness in the right foot accompanied by persistent sores on his toes which show no sign of healing even after first aid. His pain is relieved when he hangs his foot off the side of the bed.  Medical History:   The patient has a known history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus for 8 years  maintained well on insulin therapy  and follows a regular check-up with an endocrinologist. He is also diagnosed with High Blood Pressure  controlled with medication and regular checks. He has a history of intermittent claudication for the past 2 years. There is no history of any surgeries. His maternal grandfather had peripheral artery disease and his father is a hypertensive patient.   Presently  the patient is on a low salt  diabetic  balanced diet and exercise regime advised by his dietician. No known allergies have been reported. He is a non-smoker and has no history of alcohol or substance abuse.   Clinical Evaluation:  Physical examination shows an undernourished child with growth delay. Lower extremity examination reveals a pale  cold right foot with non-palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right foot shows a non-healing ulcer on the big toe. No evidence of gangrene noted.   Diagnosis:   Given his prolonged history of diabetes  hypertension  and the physical examination  the boy is suspected to have critical limb ischemia. He has been referred for further investigations including Doppler ultrasound  ankle-brachial index  and angiography for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.   In conclusion  the patient's history and critical limb ischemia deductions highlight the necessity for early recognition of disease symptoms and the importance of aggressive risk factor modification in preserving limb viability.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,54,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Yami Morales is a 73-year-old Hispanic female who presented with severe pain in her left lower extremity  specifically in the foot and calf area  for the last 2 weeks. The pain is persistent even while she is at rest. She also mentioned having non-healing ulcers on her left foot. Mrs. Morales has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 30 years  hypertension for 20 years  and hyperlipidemia for at least 10 years. She also has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but has reportedly quit 5 years ago.   Patient Demographics: Hispanic women are significantly more likely to develop critical limb ischemia (CLI) compared to their Caucasian counterparts likely due to higher rates of certain risk factors such as diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. CLI is more common among people aged over 65.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Morales has long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus  a disease that significantly increases her risk for CLI due to diabetic macrovascular and microvascular complications. Her hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and significant tobacco history further increase her risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and subsequent CLI. Advanced age is another risk factor for both PAD and CLI. The non-healing ulcers on her foot are consistent with the typical ‘diabetic foot’ presentation  often seen concomitantly with CLI in diabetic patients.  With Mrs. Morales's history of smoking  hyperlipidemia  and her age  she represents the demographic that is most likely to experience critical limb ischemia. It's important to note that management should take into account both her underlying risk factors and symptomatic presentation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,55,Title: Patient Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: I am presenting a 65-year-old African American male  Mr. L from Detroit  Michigan. Mr. L is retired  a former construction worker  and a smoker who has smoked approximately half a pack of cigarettes per day over a span of 30 years.   Demographics: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) affects the elderly population significantly  especially those aged 60 and above. Statistically  CLI is more common in males than females  and African Americans are disproportionately affected compared to other races.   Medical History: Mr. L has a significant past medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he has been managing for ten years  chronic hypertension for fifteen years  and hyperlipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and was successfully treated with a coronary stent. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) two years ago.   On initial screening  he reports recently experiencing rest pain in his right lower limb and has reported an ulcer on his right foot that has been present for three weeks and has not shown signs of healing. He frequently feels a numbing pain in his right leg during rest and encounters difficulty in walking due to pain  which aligns with the typical symptoms of CLI which include ischemic rest pain  non-healing ulcers  or gangrene.   In summary  given his smoking history and the chronic conditions including diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and PAD  Mr. L’s case reflects a common profile for a patient at-risk and inflicted with CLI  reflecting accurate demographic representation as mentioned in the literature.  Therapeutic Strategy: Mr. L’s CLI has been diagnosed in advanced stages owing to the non-healing ulcer  and a rigorous treatment plan encompassing smoking cessation  strict glucose and blood pressure control  and lipid management  shall be employed. Given the advanced stage of his CLI  it is probable he may require revascularization and/or endovascular therapy. A detailed plan and prognosis will depend on further consultation with vascular surgeons and angiographic findings.    Conclusion: CLI can be a devastating disease causing significant morbidity and mortality. Early identification  aggressive risk factor modification  and appropriate therapeutic intervention can improve patient outcomes. Mr. L's case exemplifies the high-risk populations affected by this disease  and reinforces the importance of preventative health in such at-risk populations particularly African American male smokers with multiple chronic ailments including diabetes  hypertension and PAD. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,56,Title: Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient   Patient Profile: Mr. Alvarez  76-year-old Hispanic male  Presenting Conditions: Mr. Alvarez presented to the emergency department with worsening pain in his right leg that had been ongoing for three weeks  making it difficult for him to walk. He reported a significant loss of sensation in the affected limb  along with noticeable skin color changes and a persistent ulcers on his right foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Alvarez has a long standing history of type II diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia for about 20 years. He had coronary artery bypass grafting done 10 years ago due to severe coronary artery disease. He has been a smoker for 40 years  although he quit 5 years ago.  Patient's lifestyle: He retired 10 years ago and lives with his wife. He reported a sedentary life style with lack of physical exercise and his diet is generally high in carbohydrates and fats.  Family History: Mr. Alvarez's mother died at the age of 75 due to stroke  and his father passed away at 80 due to heart failure. His elder brother had coronary artery disease and underwent bypass surgery at the age of 60.  Literature Review: Mr. Alvarez falls squarely within the typical demographic for patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). According to studies  CLI occurs most frequently in elderly patients with a mean age of 70-77 years. Men are slightly more predisposed to this condition than women  and diabetes is a prevalent comorbidity  present in up to 50% of CLI patients. Hispanic ethnicity like Mr. Alvarez  are amongst the high-risk groups for CLI  particularly those with comorbid conditions like diabetes and coronary artery disease. Furthermore  smoking history and a lack of exercise also contribute to increasing the risk of peripheral artery disease and thus  CLI.  In summary  Mr. Alvarez's demographic characteristics  past medical history and lifestyle risk factors align with the literature on the typical patient profile for CLI. His case highlights the significant influence of unmodified risk factors such as age  gender  race  and genetic predisposition  as well as modifiable risk factors such as diabetes  smoking  and lack of physical activity in the pathogenesis of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,57,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Patient Presentation   Demographics:  Mr. Jose Rodriguez is a 70-year-old Hispanic male who works as a retired construction worker and currently lives alone. He's originally from Mexico  but has been residing in San Diego  California for the past 30 years. He identifies as a non-smoker and is a social drinker.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant past medical history. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for almost 15 years  which is managed with Metformin in combination with regular insulin therapy. He also has a history of hypertension  controlled with Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide. Lastly  he has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) for 5 years and has been on Clopidogrel for the same duration.   Presenting Problem:  Mr. Rodriguez reports experiencing increasing discomfort and painful cramps in his right lower leg and foot for the past six months. He also states the pain exacerbated significantly over the past few weeks and is especially troublesome during walking  requiring him to stop frequently due to intense pain. He has also noticed his leg turning pale and feeling cold as compared to the left one.   Recently  he also noticed sores on his right foot that aren’t healing despite regular home care and has been experiencing persistent numbness in the same foot. He reports that he has not experienced any chest pain  shortness of breath or other cardiac symptoms.   His vitals are stable but physical examination reveals decreased pulses  pallor  and decreased temperature in right foot. ABI (Ankle-brachial index) is significantly reduced while duplex ultrasonography confirms reduced blood flow in the right lower leg.   Given Mr. Rodriguez's symptoms  physical findings  and past medical history  he has been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease. Due to the lack of sufficient blood flow  his leg and foot have become painful  even while at rest  and the sores are not healing  which could potentially lead to amputation if left untreated. It's crucial that Mr. Rodriguez receive treatment promptly to restore blood flow and manage his pain and other symptoms.     Demographic Representation: Studies indicate that CLI is more prevalent among individuals aged over 60 years  males  sufferers of diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease. Hence  the presentation of Mr. Rodriguez aligns with the typical demographic representation found in the literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,58,Title: Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of constant  excruciating pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the calf area  for the past week. Mr. Doe has also noticed a gradual color change to a pale  white complexion on his left foot with some ulceration on the lateral aspect of his foot. He reports that he has been having pain in his left leg for several months that used to occur while walking but had recently become constant. He extensively uses tobacco products  with a smoking history of 30-pack years.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 15 years ago  and peripheral arterial disease  diagnosed 10 years ago for which he intermittently takes prescribed medications. He reports delayed wound healing and has a known history of non-compliance with medication. Mr. Doe also has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He does not have any known drug allergies.   Discussion: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. It is frequently observed in elderly patients with a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia  making Mr. Doe a classic presentation of a patient with CLI. Non-compliance to medication contributes negatively to disease progression in his case. Early recognition and timely management of this condition are crucial to prevent limb loss and improve quality of life.   Inferred from literature  CLI is more common in people aged 60-80 years  and men are slightly more at risk than women. Smoking and Diabetes are two major risk factors for this condition so Mr. Doe falls into the majority representation of patients suffering from CLI.   Next steps would involve further vascular examination  diagnostic testing  including Ankle-brachial Index and Peripheral angiography  and evaluating treatment options including medications  angioplasty  and in some cases  surgical intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,59,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Patient is a 76-year-old African American male named John; retired secondary school teacher  now living with his wife in a suburban neighborhood of Houston  Texas.   Medical History: Upon collecting John's medical history  we found notable incidences of chronic conditions over the past 20 years including uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus II  Hypertension  and Hypercholesterolemia. John is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but his previous habit of 2 packs a day for 40 years is significant. He has no known drug allergies and takes Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin for his chronic conditions.  Present Illness: John has recently experienced progressive discomfort in his right lower limb  especially while walking. He described it as a sharp  cramping pain in his calf (intermittent claudication). There has been a recent escalation in the severity and frequency of his symptoms over the past two weeks. Of more concern  he has started feeling pain even while at rest  particularly at night when he's laying down. Additionally  he has recently noticed discoloration of his right toes  which appeared first as a blue tinge  now becoming more black over time. He has also noticed the right lower limb to be colder compared to left.  On examination  one could appreciate weak pulses in the right lower limb (femoral  popliteal  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial). A non-healing ulcer was noticed on the lateral aspect of right foot. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) reported to be less than 0.4. Duplex Ultrasound showed significant stenosis in right lower limb arteries.   Conclusion: John’s symptoms  risk factors  and test results are consistent with the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This is a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often witnessed in elderly patients with a history of Diabetes and smoking habit. Early identification and prompt management are key to preventing limb loss. Multidisciplinary management will involve strict control of blood sugars  lipid management  smoking cessation  revascularization procedures  and possible administration of antiplatelet drugs.  Patient’s consent was taken before discussing the case. Privacy rules were duly followed.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,60,"Title: Clinical Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  Subject: Mr. James Thompson  a 75-year-old African-American male  Demographic Information: Our patient  Mr. Thompson is a retired engineer  living in urban Detroit  Michigan  with his wife of 60 years. He is a non-smoker but has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. He’s been in relatively good health until a few years ago  when he was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Current Presentation: Mr. Thompson has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower limb  particularly in the foot  for the past six weeks. The pain seems to intensify when he is at rest or during the night. He also reports additional symptoms such as numbness  and more concerning  """"non-healing sores"""" on his foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. As such  he has been in regular contact with his primary care provider. He has been taking his prescribed medications  including Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. Unfortunately  it seems his blood sugar and blood pressure levels have not been well controlled.  He also has a family history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) but has never been screened for the condition. In the late stages of PAD  when the blood flow to the legs and feet is restricted  causing skin lesions or gangrene  it is known as critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mr. Thompson's symptoms of severe pain and non-healing ulcers are suggestive of CLI.  Literature Support: Demographics – According to literature  there is a higher prevalence of PAD and CLI among African-Americans and the elderly  especially those with an extensive past history of hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. This makes Mr. Thompson a typical candidate for CLI.   Risk Factors - The development and progression of CLI are strongly associated with diabetes  and studies show it is the most common condition in CLI patients  present in up to 50% to 70% of cases. Poorly controlled hypertension  as in this case  also adds to the risk of developing CLI.  In conclusion  we need to promptly address Mr. Thompson's symptoms  conduct further testing to confirm a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia  and consider intervention measures to avoid devastating consequences such as limb amputation."
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,61,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Case Presentation  Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Our case today involves a 75-year-old African-American male from a rural area. The patient is a retired blue-collar worker who has lived a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement  has been a chronic smoker with a 30 pack-year history  and reports regular alcohol consumption.  Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms  Mr. X was brought to the Emergency Department by his family insisting progressive rest pain in his right foot over the last couple of weeks. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on toes and discoloration of his foot. Due to financial constraints  he has been avoiding any medical consultations and been relying on over-the-counter pain killers for pain relief.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus that is poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemics. He was diagnosed with hypertension around 10 years ago and is currently on medication. He had a stroke two years ago with minor residual deficits.  Slide 4: Physical Examination   On physical examination  the patient was found to have diminished peripheral pulses  pallor  and coolness in the right lower limb as compared to the left. Foot showed significant atrophic changes with dystrophic nails  thin skin  and hair loss. He has a necrotic non-healing ulcer on his second toe.  Slide 5: Diagnosis   Based on his symptoms and physical examination  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made. Further tests  including Doppler ultrasound  angiography  and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were recommended for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning.  Slide 6: Conclusion  This case highlights a high-risk patient - elderly  African-American  male  smoker  sedentary  diabetic  and hypertensive  consistent with the demographic typically affected by critical limb ischemia. His symptoms suggest advanced disease  emphasizing the importance of timely intervention and the disastrous consequences of a delay due to socio-economic factors.   Slide 7: Demographic Data Reference  Literature data indicates that critical limb ischemia occurs more frequently in men  blacks  smokers  and those aged over 70 years. Patients with diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are also at higher risk (Nehler et al.  J Vasc Surg  2014). We must actively promote disease awareness and importance of early presentation in such high-risk groups.   Slide 8: Future Steps   Given the patient's condition  a multidisciplinary team approach involving vascular surgeons  endocrinologists for better diabetes management  rehabilitation therapists  dieticians  and social workers will likely provide the best outcomes. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,62,Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian   Patient John Doe presents with a primary complaint of extreme restlessness and severe pain in his right foot  especially during the night. The pain has intensified over the last two weeks and is not relieved even at rest or by the intake of regular analgesics. The patient also reports incidents of his foot getting cold and unusual paleness. There is a noted presence of small non-healing wounds on the foot. Patient also complains of slow hair growth on the right leg and weakened toenails. On physical examination  there is noted a diminished pulse in the right lower extremity.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Doe is a retired worker from the construction industry with a 40-year smoking history  now quit for the last 5 years. He had controlled hypertension for 20 years  controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  and hyperlipidemia. He underwent a coronary artery bypass surgery 8 years ago. His medications include Lisinopril  Metformin  and Atorvastatin. He does not have any known drug allergies. He has a family history of peripheral artery disease and stroke from his father's side.  Epidemiological studies suggest that critical limb ischemia occurs majorly in males over the age of 60. Thus  demographic information of Mr. Doe is in line with literature findings. Further diagnostic tests will be performed for a conclusive diagnosis.   Conclusion:   In this case  the patient's age  history of smoking  and uncontrolled diabetes put him at a greater risk for critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently experiencing pain  cold foot  non-healing ulcers  and hair growth reduction  which are all typical symptoms of critical limb ischemia. The patient has been referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management. Early diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is quintessential to avoid dire consequences including amputation and increased cardiovascular mortality risks.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,65,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Today  we are presenting a case of Mr. James Johnson  a 72-year-old African-American male who resides in Cleveland  Ohio. According to literature  the prevalence of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) from which critical limb ischemia arises  is reportedly higher in African American populations and increases with age. Mr. Johnson is retired  a widower  and lives with his daughter who helps take care of him.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a significant past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 15 years. Both diabetes and hypertension have been linked to the development of atherosclerotic disease  a common cause of PAD. Grand rounds will recall that this history places him at high risk for the development of PAD  and subsequently  critical limb ischemia.  Additionally  Mr. Johnson has a 30 pack-year history of smoking and quit smoking ten years ago. Chronic tobacco use is another one of the primary risk factors for the development of peripheral vascular diseases. Also  he has a history of hyperlipidemia for which he takes a daily statin. He has no known drug allergies.  Recent Presentation: Mr. Johnson recently presented to the emergency department with rest pain in his right lower limb  observable skin color changes  and  most concerning  a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. These symptoms  along with his critical ankle-brachial index of less than 0.4  led to the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. His symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past few weeks  and he experiences severe pain even when at rest.  In Summary: Mr. Johnson's case serves as a classic presentation of critical limb ischemia in the setting of peripheral artery disease  precipitated by risk factors such as advanced age  African American ethnicity  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a history of heavy smoking. His current treatment plan involves aggressive wound care  medical optimization for his diabetes and hypertension  and discussions with our vascular surgery colleagues regarding the potential for surgical intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,66,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Case Profile:  Patient is a 73-year-old African-American male presenting with symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He reports extensive pain in his right leg which intensifies during physical exertion as well as at rest. The patient states that the pain has become more frequent and severe over the past several months. He also presents frequent sores on his feet which either do not heal or heal at a slow pace.  Complete Demographics:  The patient is married  retired  and lives with his wife in an urban area. He is a non-smoker  but reports heavy usage in his past. The patient has Medicare insurance and visits the provider regularly for chronic conditions. He reports having a healthy diet but with limited physical activity due to mobility problems.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of chronic conditions that include diabetes and hypertension  both controlled with medications. He has suffered from coronary artery disease for the past ten years  for which he underwent angioplasty seven years ago. He also had a stroke three years ago and has since been taking regular medications to prevent recurrence. He does not have any history of mental health disorders  pulmonary disease  or liver disease.  Family medical history includes diabetes and heart disease (both parents)  with his father also having suffered from CLI. He has a sister who is currently managing hypertension.  This patient represents an accurate demographic representation of CLI patients  as research suggests that CLI is observed predominantly in the aging population  with risk factors including a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and atherosclerosis. Furthermore  CLI is also more common in men than women and slightly more common in the black population compared to white.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,67,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: Our patient  Mr. John Davis  is a 68-year-old African American man residing in New York. He is a retired construction worker and currently lives with his wife in a suburb area.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Davis has been complaining of severe pain in his lower left limb  especially in his foot  even when he is at rest. He has also noticed painful non-healing ulcers on his left foot. In the past few days  he has been walking with a noticeable limp due to the pain and discomfort.  Past Medical History: Mr. Davis has a significant past medical history. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago  which is presently poorly controlled. He is also known to have Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia for the last 10 years. His history further reveals an ongoing 50-year pack history of smoking  despite multiple failed attempts to quit smoking. He had Stroke 5 years ago  from which he recovered with minor residual left-sided weakness.   Literature Consistency: According to literature  critical limb ischemia (CLI) is more prevalent among the elderly population over 60 and people with a history of smoking  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension - making Mr. Davis an archetype patient. Furthermore  the literature also states that CLI is more prevalent among African American populations than any other racial or ethnic groups.   In conclusion  Mr. Davis presents a classic case of critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to his demographic and risk factors such as age  race  history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and chronic smoking habits. It is crucial to address his condition promptly to prevent further pain  disability  and risk of limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,68,Patients Profile: Patient Name: John Douglass  Gender: Male Age: 68 Address: Miami  Florida Occupation: Retired    Presentation of Patient's Case: Today I present a case of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient  Mr. John Douglass  is a 68-year-old retired male of African-American ethnicity. Mr. Douglass lives in Miami  Florida and has been presenting frequent complaints of unrelenting foot pain over the past few weeks  especially when he is lying flat. Furthermore  he reports of a non-healing ulcer on his left foot. Upon initial physical examination  his left foot appears pale with noticeable hair loss  and cold to the touch  relative to the right foot.   Past Medical History: Mr. Douglass has a medical history significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medication for the past 12 years. He also reports a 20-year history of smoking albeit he has quit about 5 years ago. Mr. Douglass had a stent placed in his left heart artery about 6 years ago.   Analysis: The demographics and past medical history of Mr. Douglass align well with literature data which elaborates that CLI chiefly affects elderly patients. It is estimated by literature that 50-90% of CLI patients have a history of smoking. Moreover  Mr. Douglass's history of diabetes  hypertension  and coronary artery disease are risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and CLI  thereby correlating with studies establishing these diseases as significant predictors for developing CLI.   A plan for further diagnostic tests like angiography and treatment options including revascularization and medication adjustments will be pursued. Prompt intervention is needed due to the high risk of amputation and mortality associated with untreated CLI.  This case emphasizes the critical role of early recognition and management of CLI  especially in high-risk patients with a history of smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,69,Title: A Case Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: We present the case of a 78-year-old African American male patient  Mr. L  with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Demographics: According to literature  CLI tends to be more prevalent among African Americans  older populations  and men  thus Mr. L closely aligns with this demographic representation.  Patient History: Mr. L is a retired truck driver and a widower who lives alone. He has a strong past medical history  core elements of which include Type 2 diabetes for 25 years  hypertension for 30 years  and a history of tobacco use  but quit smoking approximately 10 years ago. He takes metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention  and simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. He has no allergies to medication.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. L presented to the clinic with complaints of severe pain in his left lower extremity  particularly at rest  that significantly worsens at night. He reports having had a non-healing ulcer on his left foot for approximately 2 months  which began as a small blister that gradually increased in size. Physical examination has shown signs of decreased sensation and motor function  coldness of the limb  and absence of pulse in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.   He also reports difficulty in walking short distances due to claudication (cramping  pain  fatigue or heaviness in the muscles during activity)  and has been unintentionally losing weight.  Conclusion: Taken together  Mr. L's advanced age  comorbid health conditions  particularly his poorly controlled diabetes  high blood pressure  smoking history  along with his aforementioned symptoms and physical exam findings  indicate Critical Limb Ischemia. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and intervention as CLI has a high risk for limb loss  development of gangrene and increased cardiovascular mortality. The presentation sheds light on the need for integrated care involving vascular surgeons  podiatrists  diabetologists  and wound care specialists to optimally manage CLI patients like Mr. L  thereby improving their prognosis and quality of life by reducing preventable limb loss.   Aggressive risk factor modification  intensive wound care  revascularization  and surgical management where indicated  along with consistent monitoring and follow-ups  need to be instituted promptly in such scenarios. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,70,"Patient Presentation: Understanding Critical Limb Ischemia   Our patient is Mr. James Murphy  a 69-year-old Caucasian male hailing from downtown Boston  Massachusetts. According to the literature  critical limb ischemia (CLI) is more prevalent among Caucasian males aged 60 and above  and Mr. Murphy falls into this demographic.  Mr. Murphy has a significant past medical history. He worked in construction for 40 years and has been a heavy smoker since he was a teenager. Unfortunately  he has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and has struggled to manage it effectively over the past 15 years. He has chronic hypertension  for which he is on medication  and has been treated for hyperlipidemia for the past ten years. His father passed away due to stroke  and his mother had peripheral artery disease  thus family history suggests a strong predisposition toward cardiovascular conditions.   Prior to the current presentation  Mr. Murphy had complained of chronic leg pain for several months  especially while walking  known as claudication. Recent developments have witnessed severe  constant pain even at rest  progressing over the past few weeks. He reports having disrupted sleep due to the pain and has also noticed that his foot appears darker and feels cooler than usual. In fact  he movingly described the sensation as having his """"foot dipped in ice and also on fire at the same time."""" He's also found non-healing sores on his toes.  As clinicians  we are alarmed as the symptoms point towards critical limb ischemia  the most serious form of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  occluding the blood flow to his extremities  specifically his right leg at this point. This is a severe condition that requires swift diagnosis confirmation and immediate medical intervention.   Understanding his demographic  lifestyle factors such as heavy smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  and a powerful family history of cardiovascular diseases  Mr. Murphy falls into the high-risk zone for CLI. Further diagnostics and an appropriate treatment plan could potentially prevent life-threatening complications like heart attack  stroke  or even lower extremity amputation."
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,71,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient: Mr. Lewis is a 73-year-old African American male  living in an urban setting within the United States.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Lewis came in complaining of severe  recurring pain in his left lower leg  particularly at rest. He also mentioned noticing a non-healing ulcer on his left foot  near the big toe. He has been experiencing progressive difficulty in walking  which is beginning to diminish his daily life activities.  Past Medical History: Mr. Lewis has a significant history of medical conditions that places him at a higher risk for developing critical limb ischemia. He has been battling diabetes mellitus for the past 25 years  which is moderately controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a 20-year history of hypertension and has been on anti-hypertensive medication. Approximately 10 years back  he was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. Moreover  he is a former smoker  having quit around 15 years ago but had a 30 pack-year smoking history until then.  Family History:  His father had a history of stroke  and his elder brother underwent lower limb amputation due to uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.  Social History: Mr. Lewis is retired  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He quit smoking 15 years ago but occasionally indulges in social drinking.   Clinical Examination & Assessment: Further examination of his left foot revealed decreased temperature and pallor compared to the right foot  indicating poor circulation. Pulses were barely palpable in the left foot  and capillary refill time was prolonged. An ulcer was noted on his big toe  which appeared necrotic in the center with surrounding erythema and edema. Pain was exacerbated while his leg was elevated and eased when in a dependent position  suggestive of rest pain associated with advanced peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia.  Based on the history  clinical examination  and risk profile  a provisional diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made  and further diagnostic tests  including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and angiography  were planned for appropriate staging and management.  In conclusion  Mr. Lewis's presentation corroborates with the global picture of critical limb ischemia patients  who are often older adults and have identifiable risk factors such as long-term smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to reduce the likelihood of limb loss and improve survival and quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,72,"Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Presentation: The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male  resident of Atlanta  Georgia  who presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He has been experiencing severe pain in his right foot and leg for a few weeks now. Alongside the persistent pain  the patient cites that his foot has been cold to the touch and that he has detected a certain degree of numbness in his toes. Furthermore  the patient reports suffering from intermittent claudication for the last few years  and the related pain has recently escalated. This pain is now constant and disturbs his sleep.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history  dominated by known comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past ten years. He has been under medication and follows dietary restrictions for these conditions. He is a previous smoker  having quit smoking ten years ago. He has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) eight years ago. The cardiovascular problems exhibited by the patient correlate with the high prevalence of peripheral arterial disease  including CLI  among those with coronary artery disease. He has a family history of vascular diseases  as his father had peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and his mother died from a stroke. He’s also obese with a BMI of 32.  Geting into the racial differences in CLI  literature suggests that African-Americans experience a higher prevalence and more severe grades of PAD than their white counterparts. Moreover  in the southeastern United States  also regarded as the """"stroke belt """" stroke mortality rates are among the highest nationwide  which predisposes this patient - given his African-American ethnicity and the geographical location - to vascular diseases.  The patient’s diabetes  smoking history  hypertension  obesity  family history of vascular diseases  and prior coronary artery disease history place him at a high-risk category for critical limb ischemia. It is crucial to provide immediate intervention to avoid severe sequelae  such as amputation. This case underlines the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment in patients at risk of CLI  considering the underlying risk factors and demographic predispositions."

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,74,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  I. Introduction  Patient Information: Mr. José Fernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  living in Central Florida  has presented with severe limb pain at rest  ulcers  and gangrene signs consistent with critical limb ischemia. His ethnic background is notable as Hispanics are disproportionately affected by peripheral artery disease  from which CLI emerges.  II. Past Medical History  Mr. Fernandez has a significant past medical history including hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. The patient has always been consistent with his medications but has had poor glycemic control  reflecting in his Hemoglobin A1C levels around 9-10%. He struggled with cigarette smoking for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He also has a history of intermittent claudication for the past five years.   His medications include Metformin 1000 mg twice a day  Lisinopril 40 mg once daily  and Atorvastatin 20 mg once at night. He underwent coronary angioplasty due to a myocardial infarction three years ago  and there has been no incidence of coronary events since. He also maintains a strict diet due to his chronic renal disease (CRD)  stage III  likely secondary to his longstanding diabetes.  III. Discussion  Mr. Fernandez is a high-risk patient for CLI. CLI generally afflicts older adults  with a more considerable prevalence among men. Patients with disease states such as diabetes  chronic kidney disease stage III  and established cardiovascular disease  like Mr. Fernandez  top the list for CLI risks. Also  tobacco use  even though discontinued  shapes a significant risk factor. CLI prominently affecting the Hispanic population calls for applying focused preventive strategies among this group.  IV. Conclusion  Identifying critical limb ischemia in critical-risk individuals provides appropriate and timely management  which is vital in reducing the risk for limb loss. With his extensive past medical history and chronic conditions  Mr. Fernandez's case underscores the importance of vigilant follow-ups and aggressive risk factor modification for the successful management of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,75,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting Mr. Charles Baker  a 76-year-old African-American male  currently residing in Miami  Florida  who is being evaluated for symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mr. Baker comes from a moderately low socio-economic background and has been reported to have been a former smoker  smoking one pack a day for the past 40 years  though he quit 10 years ago.  Mr. Baker presented with severe  worsening pain in his right lower limb even during rest and has noticed the presence of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. He also reports numbness and coldness in the right leg with limb discoloration. He has a notorious lack of peripheral pulses in the right leg. Additionally  he reports experiencing intermittent claudication initially; however  over the past two months  the symptoms have progressed significantly.  Past Medical History: Mr. Baker has a known history of Type II diabetes mellitus  controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypertension over the last 15 years. He suffered a myocardial infarction 6 years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) thereafter. He reported having a family history for peripheral artery disease (PAD)  as his elder brother  now deceased  also had CLI.  In terms of medication  he is currently on aspirin  statins  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors for his hypertension and coronary artery disease  and Metformin for his type II diabetes mellitus. He is also taking Pregabalin for neuropathic pain.  This patient's case fits the demographic pattern of patients with CLI  who are often older adults with known atherosclerotic risk factors comprising smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and a familial history of atherosclerotic disease. His symptoms match the noted characteristics of CLI  including rest pain  numbness  and nonhealing ulcers on the foot.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,76,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Introduction:   Mrs. Evelyn Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Hispanic female  presents at our vascular clinic due to severe pain in her right lower leg  foot ulcer  and dark discoloration of toes consistent with the diagnoses of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Born and raised in South Florida  Mrs. Rodriguez is a retired school teacher. She is a mother of 3 and grandmother to 6 grandchildren. Mrs. Rodriguez has limited mobility due to the lower extremity pain and relies on family members for care and support. She is a nonsmoker  but lives with secondhand smoke due to her husband's smoking habit.  Past Medical History:  In her lifetime  she has managed chronic conditions notably  diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. She has been treated for peripheral artery disease (PAD) for the past decade. She has a past surgical history of a successful coronary artery bypass graft operation 6 years ago. Mrs. Rodriguez's familial history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. Other past medical conditions include mild kidney disease and intermittent hypercholesterolemia. Her medications include metformin  lisinopril  and a standard dose of a statin.  Current Presentation:  Mrs. Rodriguez presents with symptoms typical of critical limb ischemia  such as intermittent pain at rest  non-healing sores on her right foot  and a notable cold feeling in her right foot compared to her left. Her symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 3 months leading to discomfort and difficulty in performing her daily activities like walking.  According to recent data and patient demographics for peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia  Mrs. Rodriguez fits into the typical demographic  including age  race  and existing co-morbidities like diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol. The co-occurrence of these conditions puts her at an elevated risk for CLI. A thorough physical examination and the necessary diagnostic tests are the next steps to assess the severity of her condition and plan her individualized treatment strategy.   In conclusion  Mrs. Rodriguez is a typical representative of the demographics often diagnosed with CLI. Given her past medical history and the advanced progression of her symptoms  a comprehensive and aggressive treatment plan is essential to restore her quality of life and prevent limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,77,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in Elderly Patients with a History of Long-Term Smoking and Diabetic Complications   Patient Presentation: Our patient is Robert  a 72-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  who presented with non-healing ulcers on his right foot. He is a long-time resident of Atlanta  Georgia and lives with his wife of 45 years. He has two adult children who live in the same city.  Robert has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years and hypertension for the past 15 years  both are reasonably well-controlled with medication. He admits to smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes every day since the age of 18  but has recently cut down to 10 cigarettes a day since being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 5 years ago. He also has a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIA)  with the last episode occurring about 3 years ago.  Symptoms: Robert has been experiencing severe pain in the right foot while at rest  which interrupts his sleep. He further complains about the persistent coldness of his foot along with some numbness. He presented his primary care physician with two relatively small ulcers on the dorsum of his foot that have not healed over 2 months.   Literature Review: The patient's age  ethnicity  history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and COPD make him a typical patient suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is more frequently observed in older (over 60-65 years)  male patients  especially those with a history of smoking and diabetes  as these are the most significant risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (Shu & Santulli  2018). Furthermore  African Americans are more likely to have PAD than Caucasians (CDC  2020). Also  a history of TIA implies established atherosclerotic disease  contributing further to Robert's risk (Shu & Santulli  2018).  Summary: Thus  this patient is a classic presentation of someone with CLI due to his long history of smoking  diabetes  vascular risk factors and now presents with rest pain and non-healing ulcers  which are significant red flags for this disease. Given his symptoms  we are dealing with a case of 'Rutherford class 4/5' CLI. Immediate attention is required to manage this case efficiently to provide a good quality of life and prevent amputation.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,78,Presenting Patient:   We have a 68-year-old African American female patient  Mrs. X  presenting with symptoms of critical limb ischemia. She is a retired school teacher and is a longtime resident of a suburban community in North Carolina. She is married with three grown children.   Medical History:  The patient has a noted history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been insulin-dependent for the past 10 years. She also has a documented history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which have been managed with medication for the past 15 years. Mrs. X is an ex-smoker  having quit five years ago with a 40-pack year history. She is also known to have peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years prior to this incident.  Presenting Condition:  Recently  Mrs. X had been experiencing severe pain in her right lower leg that had been progressively worsening over the past three weeks. She reported the pain was significantly worse while walking and during the night  which had resulted in sleep disturbances. She also mentioned slight discoloration and coldness of her right leg. On examination  marked pallor on elevation of the right leg and dependent rubor on hanging was observed. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable. An ulcer was noticed on the lateral aspect of her right foot along with noted hair loss on the leg.  These symptoms in conjunction with her medical history and physical examination led to the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of PAD. This severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  reduced blood-flow substantially causing chronic pain  skin ulcers  or gangrene.   The plan is to conduct thorough vascular testing to confirm CLI  mapping of the vascular circulation  and subsequently  to devise a comprehensive treatment plan.  Outlook:  The prognosis of CLI varies depending on age  health status  and the degree of ischemia but needless to say  her condition is severe and will require aggressive treatment for limb preservation and to improve her overall quality of life. Managing modifiable risk factors  such as her diabetes  hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  will also be integral to her treatment plan. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,79,Patient Presentation:   Our patient is a 75-year-old African American male  named Mr. Johnson  who presented to the Vascular surgery department with signs of critical limb ischemia in his right leg.   The patient’s medical history is significant for long-standing peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosis for 15 years  and he is a known hypertensive for 30 years. Mr. Johnson has been a heavy smoker for about 50 years and is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis for over a decade. His diabetic condition led to a chronic kidney disease diagnosed 5 years ago. At his most recent check-up  lab results indicated persistently elevated levels of blood sugars  reflecting poor glycemic control.   Two years ago  he underwent angioplasty but has experienced recurrent symptoms of claudication over the last six months. On current physical examination  he showed painful ulcers on his right lower extremity and rest pain  indicating severe disease.  Family history reveals father died of a stroke at the age of 70  his mother passed away due to heart disease at 80  and one of his two siblings has diabetes type 2.   Mr. Johnson  given his African American ethnicity  advanced age  male sex  smoking history  underlying PAD  hypertension  diabetes  and chronic kidney disease  falls into the high-risk group for critical limb ischemia  as per available literature.   His poor metabolic control  advanced age  and long-term smoking habit are significant contributing factors to his clinical presentation.   This patient presentation is an epitome of the literature on critical limb ischemia  highlighting that these individuals are typically older  dominantly male  and often have comorbid conditions such as diabetes  hypertension  and a history of smoking. Particularly notable is that African Americans might face a higher risk for the condition compared to Caucasians.   Given Mr. Johnson's case  it's imperative to offer an aggressive yet suitable treatment approach  considering his risk factors  medical history  and current health status.  Overall  his case underscores the importance of a holistic approach to patient care  emphasizing preventive strategies  lifestyle modification  and optimal control of underlying conditions to reduce the severity and complications associated with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,80,Slide 1: Introduction  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia. He hails from a semi-urban setting and lives by himself.  Slide 2: Current Complaints The patient came to seek medical help due to worsening symptoms over the past six months  including high-intensity pain in his lower right extremity  particularly at rest. He also reported increasing difficulty in walking short distances and presence of non-healing ulcers on the foot.   Slide 3: Demographics and Prevalence Literature suggests that critical limb ischemia majorly affects elderly males over the age of 70 with a relatively higher prevalence among Caucasians. There is also a higher risk in individuals with lower socioeconomic status  largely due to lifestyle factors and limited healthcare access.  Slide 4: Medical History The patient has a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has a 50 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking five years ago. He also has a documented history of peripheral artery disease  diagnosed three years ago.

Critical Limb Ischemia,1,81,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  I. Patient Profile Name: Mr. Rodriguez Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Hispanic-Latino Occupation: Retired Residence: San Antonio  Texas  II. Past Medical History Mr. Rodriguez has a history of Type 2 Diabetes for the past 10 years  controlled with Insulin and Metformin. He has also been diagnosed with Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia eight years ago which are controlled with Amlodipine and Atorvastatin respectively. He has been a chronic smoker for the past 35 years  with a significant past habit of heavy alcohol consumption. About five years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.  III. Present History Mr. Rodriguez presents with complaints of severe pain in his lower extremities  specifically his left foot. The pain has been persistent and worsens while resting  often disturbing his sleep. He mentioned that the pain was initially improved with walking but has worsened over the past few weeks.   He has also noted the development of sores on his left foot that are not healing and are worsening with time. The skin around his left foot started to look darker and he has felt a decrease in the temperature of the foot.  IV. Clinical Examination On clinical examination  the skin of his left foot appeared pale and cold to touch with signs of trophic skin changes. His left foot showed poor capillary refill time and decreased sensation. There were non-healing wounds with blackened tissue (gangrene) below his left ankle. His dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable  indicating an impaired arterial supply. No edema was noted and venous refill was normal. His baseline EKG presents a normal sinus rhythm.  V. Risk Factors Major risk factors that are present in Mr. Rodriguez's case include his ethnicity  age group (above 60)  history of Diabetes Mellitus  Hyperlipidemia  Hypertension  previous Peripheral Artery Disease  and chronic smoking history.  These factors and symptoms indicated that Mr. Rodriguez is suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to cause severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  This case report represents a typical patient with critical limb ischemia according to the literature  where patients are often elder males  heavy smokers with Diabetes  and other cardiovascular disease risks such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,82,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Introduction: Today we discuss Mr. Ahmed  a 68-year-old African American male  presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Demographics: Mr. Ahmed is a retired public school teacher who lives alone. He is a widower  non-smoker  and moderate alcohol consumer. He resides in a suburban neighborhood and is financially independent with health insurance coverage.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Ahmed reports progressive pain in his left calf over the past 6 months  starting as discomfort when walking (claudication)  escalating to pain at rest. He also complains of a non-healing ulcer on the tip of his left big toe. Of note  the patient reports unintentional weight loss and reduced appetite over the last few months.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ahmed is a known hypertensive and has dealt with Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 12 years  for which he is on Metformin. He had a Myocardial Infarction 5 years ago  treated with angioplasty and stenting. He continues to take low-dose Aspirin. He also has hypercholesterolemia managed with Atorvastatin.  In recent months  due to his progressive claudication  he saw a local clinician who initiated Ramipril and increased his dose of Atorvastatin  with noted mild improvement.  Family History: Mr. Ahmed's father died at 78 years due to complications of coronary artery disease and diabetes. His mother passed away at 83 years due to a stroke; she was hypertensive and had peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Social History: Mr. Ahmed lives by himself. He has two daughters and three grandchildren who live out-of-state. He has a close circle of friends he meets regularly at a community senior citizens’ center. He has a relatively active lifestyle but has been restricted by his leg pain.  Review of Systems:  Mr. Ahmed suffers from disturbed sleep due to nocturnal leg pain. He denies any fever  nausea  vomiting  chest pain  dyspnea  cough  constipation  or urinary symptoms.  Discussion: Mr. Ahmed presents with advanced CLI  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood-flow to the extremities and has progressed to chronic ischemic rest pain. His demographic details  co-morbidities  and disease progression are in line with medical literature indicating primary risk factors for CLI include being over 60 years of age  male  African American  and having a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels.   This case highlights the necessity for early intervention and aggressive management of modifiable risk factors to prevent progression to CLI in this patient group.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,83,Slide 1: Introduction  Good day everyone. Today we are presenting a case of a patient suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which dramatically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  known smoker for last 30 years  with a BMI of 31  indicative of obesity. The patient falls within the most common demographic for this condition  as the literature tells us that CLI is more frequent in the elderly and African-American populations. The patient lives in an urban setting and has had limited physical activity. He has a history of a sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   This patient has a significant past medical history. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes for the past 20 years  and Hypertension for the past 15 years  conditions which are both potential risk factors for critical limb ischemia. He has also had a history of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) for the last five years.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation  He reports increasing pain in his left lower limb  noticeable at rest but more intense during minimal exertion like walking short distances  which he refers as intermittent claudication. On physical examination  the left foot was cold with a lack of pedal pulses and an ankle-brachial index of 0.3. Further signs of chronic disease include presence of a non-healing ulcer on the left heel measuring 2 x 3 cm.  Slide 5: Conclusion   In conclusion  our patient grappling with significant cardiovascular risk factors like smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and obesity is now manifesting signs of critical limb ischemia. Rapid intervention is necessary to alleviate his symptoms and prevent serious complications such as limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,84,Title: Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Geriatric Patient  Patient Profile:  Mr. Lawrence Johnson is a 74-year old African American male hailing from a semi-urban setting in Georgia  USA. He is retired and lives with his wife. He is the 2nd youngest of the 6 siblings in his family. He has a history of smoking (40 pack years) but quit 12 years ago. Mr. Johnson lives an essentially sedentary lifestyle and is unfortunately afflicted with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and chronic hypertension.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Johnson presents to the clinic with an enduring wound on his right foot which has been non-healing for the past 6 weeks. The wound is associated with severe pain at rest  forcing him to hang his right foot off the side of his bed to alleviate the pain. He reports no fever or recent trauma to his lower limb.  Past Medical History:  Mr Johnson has been living with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 22 years  which is currently being managed with metformin and basal insulin. He has a 20 year history of hypertension  which is currently under control with a combination of ACE inhibitors and thiazides.  Over the last 10 years  Mr. Johnson has also been dealing with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which has been asymptomatic till now. His last ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured 0.80 a year ago.   Mr. Johnson experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) a year ago and was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and statins. Mr. Johnson does not report any allergies.   Patient's recent labs show HbA1c of 8.2%  LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dL and BP of 140/85mmHg. Renal function is within normal limits.  Based on all the above clinical features and past medical history  preliminary assessment points towards Critical limb ischemia (CLI). Further diagnostic measures are needed for confirmation and staging of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management may help Mr. Johnson to preserve the limb function and improve the quality of life. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,85,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information: Mr. Miguel Garcia is a 75-year-old Hispanic male residing in Los Angeles  California. He is retired and lives with his wife in a single-level home.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Garcia presents with severe pain in his right leg  even at rest. The pain is predominantly in his calf  foot  and toes. The pain is worsening and is unrelieved by his regular pain medication. He also reports intermittent numbness and coldness of the foot.   Medical History: Mr. Garcia has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with oral hypoglycemics  and hypertension  controlled with prescribed medications. He has been a smoker for forty years but quit five years ago. He also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and underwent angioplasty and stent placement in the same extremity two years ago.  Family History: Both his parents and a brother died of cardiovascular disease. His older sister has diabetes and hypertension.   Social History: Mr. Garcia was an accountant before retirement  and he is moderately active. He neither drinks alcohol nor uses any recreational drugs. He is a former smoker  having quit roughly five years ago.  Assessment: Upon physical examination  his right foot is noticeably colder than his left one. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable on the right side and are weak on the left side. His skin shows changes associated with chronic ischemia  such as pallor  hair loss  and presence of non-healing ulcers on the lesser toes. Doppler studies show a significantly reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI) on the right side.  Summary: Mr. Garcia's longstanding diabetes  history of hypertension  and previous history of tobacco use contribute to the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. These findings align with existing literature  which indicates that CLI often occurs in the elderly population (>70 years)  particularly in those with comorbidities like diabetes  peripheral arterial disease  or a history of smoking.  Further investigation  such as angiography  will confirm the diagnosis and help plan appropriate interventions. Given the critical nature of CLI  swift action is required to restore blood flow  manage pain  and prevent limb loss. The interdisciplinary team  including vascular surgeons  interventional radiologists  endocrinologists  and wound care specialists  should work together in managing Mr. Garcia's condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,86,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male presenting symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Demographic Background: The patient resides in an urban population setting in the United States. He is a retired steel mill worker and has lived an active life. His family history shows that hypertension and diabetes run in the family. He happens to be a chronic smoker  with an extensive smoking history of 50 pack-years.  Medical History: This patient has a notable history of various health conditions  including hypertension  diagnosed at age 50  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed fifteen years ago. He has also been managing his hyperlipidemia for the past ten years with the use of statins. He had a Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) five years ago  which is stable now. In addition to this  he has been experiencing intermittent claudication for the past three years with an increasing level of severity.  Presenting Symptoms: Over the past six months  the quality of life of this patient has significantly declined with a persistent  non-healing ulcer on his left foot. This has been accompanied by rest pain  manifesting as a burning sensation limited to the left lower extremity  particularly in the foot region. The pain is severe and tends to increase during the night or during periods of rest.   The patient physical examination suggests a diminished pulse in the left lower leg while his right lower extremity pulses are intact. The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 28  and his blood pressure has been controlled at 130/85 mmHg but his fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels depict poor glycemic control. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) on the left is recorded as 0.40  indicating severe arterial disease.   Based on the symptoms and clinical examinations  we suspect the patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia  a severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Further diagnosis and intervention will be guided by vascular specialty input.  In summary  the patient belongs to a high-risk demographic for CLI and the comorbid conditions along with poor glycemic control  extended smoking habits and subsequent complications suggests a complicated prognosis requiring urgent comprehensive medical attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,87,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Demographic Information:  Mr. Smith is a 72-year-old African American male who is a retired mechanic.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been a chronic smoker for over 45 years  and he has a documented history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus over the last 20 years  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has an established history of refractory hypertension and high cholesterol  controlled by antihypertensive and statin medications  respectively. He has a cardiovascular history of peripheral artery disease diagnosed ten years ago  for which he has been receiving medical management. There is no history suggestive of coronary artery disease or previous strokes.  Current Presentation: Lately  he has been experiencing recurrent and progressively worsening pain in his right lower limb  especially on walking  which has started disturbing his sleep too. The pain does not subside with rest anymore. On examination  his right foot showed non-healing ulcers at bunion sites and the limb is cold to touch. His popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses are non-palpable on the right side. There's noticeable muscle wasting in the right leg as compared to the left one.  These symptoms and clinical findings suggest that Mr. Smith's peripheral artery disease may have progressed to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). CLI is often experienced more in male patients over 65 years of age  particularly with Mr. Smith's profile of long-term smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  and other cardiovascular conditions.   Long term prognosis in such cases is largely dependent on the level and extent of arterial blockage  presence of comorbid conditions  and the patient's general health status. Early detection and comprehensive management involving medical therapy  lifestyle modifications  and timely revascularization strategies can improve the quality of life and prevent limb loss.  Consultation with a vascular surgeon is due as per protocol in our institution for all CLI patients and to discuss the need for potential intervention to restore blood flow. In addition  a diabetes specialist and dietitian consult might aid to optimize his glycemic control and general health. Given the risk factors and condition  the patient's family must be notified of the possible prognosis and options available.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,88,"Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information: Our patient  Mr. L.M.  is a 72-year-old African American male. He is retired  resides in an urban setting  and is a lifetime non-smoker. He weighs approximately 200 lbs  and is 5'8"""" tall.   Medical History: The patient has an extensive known medical history of several years  including type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are maintained with regular medication. He also has a prior diagnosis of intermittent claudication and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  three years back  for which he successfully underwent angioplasty. He continues on his prescribed medications for these conditions but has been inconsistent with exercise regimen.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. L.M. presented with complaints of rest pain in the right lower limb  particularly at night. The pain predominantly affects his foot and intensifies when he lies flat or elevates his limb. He describes the pain as severe and persistent  compromising his sleep. He has also observed development of some non-healing sores on his toes on the same foot.  Clinical Assessment: Upon examination  the right foot appears pale with observable hair loss and dry  shiny skin. The wounds on the toes show signs of ulceration. Pulses are barely palpable on the affected side. Pain level reported as 8/10.   These findings are suggestive of critical limb ischemia with ulceration. Given his history of atherosclerosis and the modifiable risk factors  the patient is generally at elevated risk for CLI.   Recommendations: We would recommend Mr. M.L. for further diagnostic tests  including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Duplex ultrasound  CT angiography and/or MRA. An immediate referral to vascular surgery for consultation and potential revascularization procedures is warranted. Aggressive management of his hypertension and diabetes is also crucial  along with smoking cessation counseling  even though he's not a smoker. Training on foot care to prevent further infection or amputation is necessary. The patient’s family should be informed and educated about the seriousness of the disease and the importance of adherence to prescribed treatment. Overall  Mr. L.M.’s case represents a typical patient with critical limb ischemia  underscoring the critical nature of early detection and management."
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,89,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile:  Mr. James Thompson  a 69-year-old Caucasian male  presented with rest pain in his right lower extremity.  Demographics:  Mr. Thompson falls within the average age bracket (60-80 years old) at which most cases of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) are diagnosed. The male gender and his Caucasian ethnicity represent the majority demographic predisposed to this condition in Western populations.   Life-Style:  Mr. Thompson is a retired bus driver and has been known to smoke 1-pack cigarettes daily for the past 45 years  contributing significantly to atherosclerotic disease. He lives independently but has limited physical abilities due to his current condition.  Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a history of Type 2 Diabetes which is currently controlled with Metformin. His latest HbA1c was 6.8%. He also has a diagnosis of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  and Hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin. He underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease five years ago. All these conditions have collectively contributed to his peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (Thromboangiitis obliterans) and consequent CLI.  Current Complaints:  The patient complains of persistent  distressing pain in his right leg  particularly at night. He also reports non-healing wounds on his right foot  further complicated by his diabetes. This pain has progressively worsened over the last two months  severely interfering with his quality of life and sleep. He also experiences weakness and chilling of the affected leg.  Necessary Investigations:  The patient’s clinical presentation  alongside necessary investigations (like the ankle-brachial index  toe pressures  ultrasound  CT angiography  or MR angiography)  will confirm the diagnosis of CLI. His severity of PAD can be evaluated and strategized for further treatment.  In conclusion  Mr. Thompson's case is representative of the primary demographic and clinical presentation frequently associated with Critical Limb Ischemia  underpinned by lifestyle factors and comorbidities such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease. His presentation underlines the urgency of addressing these significant risk factors in prevention strategies and management plans for CLI patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,90,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient: Mr. James Smith  male  aged 65  Caucasian  retired school teacher  married with three adult children.   Address: Suburbs of Cincinnati  Ohio.   Presenting Problem:   Mr. Smith came to the clinic complaining of severe pain in his right lower leg and foot. He reported noticeable slow-healing sores on his toes and decreased hair growth on the limb. The pain typically aggravates when he’s in a resting position  preventing him from having a sound sleep.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of 15 years of uncontrolled type II diabetes and a past diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (PAD). He also has a history of tobacco use  but he quit smoking about two years ago. He has hypertension  managed with medications. Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with high cholesterol level but failed to follow through on his medication regimen due to his reported struggle with depression over the past five years. He also has a familial history of cardiovascular disease  with his father suffering a stroke at the age of 70.  Recent blood sugar levels have consistently remained above 200 mg/dl. His total cholesterol is 240 mg/dl  LDL 160 mg/dl  and HDL 40 mg/dl. His retinopathy related to diabetes was treated a few years ago. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 27.3 - a brief survey into his dietary habits reveals a consumption pattern rich in saturated fats and simple sugars.  He is currently using insulin therapy for diabetes and oral medications for hypertension. His last reported Hba1c level was 9.5 percent  indicating poor long-term glucose control.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical exam  his right leg presented as colder than the left  with diminished pulses  noticeable discoloration  shiny skin  brittle nails  and a leg sore that refuses to heal - typically indicative of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His ankle-brachial index (ABI) result was 0.4  well below the normal range  corroborating the suspicion of CLI.   In Sum:  Mr. Smith's long history of untreated diabetes  PAD  hypertension  high cholesterol  family history of cardiovascular disease  and previous smoking habit have likely put him at high risk for developing Critical Limb Ischemia. The consistent leg pain described  along with the indication of ABI and physical showing  confirmed the presence of CLI. According to the patient’s condition  a consultation with a vascular surgeon is suggested to prevent further progression and discuss potential revascularization options. Early intervention and adherence to treatment plans should help in addressing his presenting problem. Simultaneously  his diabetes and other comorbidities should be addressed by a multi-disciplinary team to provide holistic care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,91,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Details: Mr. Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the clinic today with symptoms of critical limb ischemia. He has been living alone in the community after he lost his wife two years ago. He is a retired school teacher with no known cognitive impairment. He religiously indulges in a moderate diet  abstaining from alcohol  and tobacco products.  Presenting Complaints: He complains of an ongoing dull ache in his lower left limb that has steadily worsened over the past few weeks. The limb pain has been more severe lately and is present even while resting  which has compromised his sleeping patterns. He also noticed a few non-healing ulcers around the lateral aspect of his left foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) seven years ago and has been on antiplatelet medication since then. He has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 10 years. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has a significant family history of heart diseases.  Current medications include antihypertensive drugs  insulin for diabetes  and statins for his cholesterol issues. He does not have any known allergies to medication.  On Examination: He appears chronically ill and underweight. The affected limb has a diminished pulsation with a slower capillary refill. He has a cool  hairless  and pale left lower limb with palpable calf tenderness. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are weak. Several non-healing wounds are present on his left foot’s lateral aspect. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) value has also significantly decreased by 50%.  Given his age  medical history  symptoms  and examination  Mr. Thompson likely has critical limb ischemia and requires immediate vascular intervention.  This presentation reflects the tail end of the typical patient journey of a PAD patient progressing to critical limb ischemia  frequently occurring in elderly males  often with a history of diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. The progression to this advanced stage underscores the importance of preventative measures and early therapeutic interventions in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,92,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in an Elderly Male with a History of Cardiovascular Disease   Good evening  colleagues.  Patient Information:  Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 75-year-old African-American male who has presented with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a retired mechanic  living independently with his wife in an urban setting.  Previous Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a long-standing history of cardiovascular disease. For the past 15 years he has been diagnosed and managed for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Additionally  he had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 10 years ago. Mr. Johnson has been a heavy smoker for over 5 decades  a factor that has significantly contributed to his cardiovascular problems.  Current Presentation: Recently  Mr. Johnson has been experiencing significant pain in his left leg  particularly in the calf region. The pain often intensifies during night time or when the limb is at rest. His wife noticed the skin of the affected limb becoming pale and shiny over the past few weeks. Mr. Johnson has also reported coldness in his left foot  decreased hair growth on the leg  and delayed healing of small cuts  combined with an overall feeling of weakness in the leg.  After an in-depth analysis and examination  these symptoms of rest pain  non-healing wounds  and changes in skin color and temperature correlate with the clinical manifestations of critical limb ischemia.  Due to his age  race  smoking history  and existing heart diseases  Mr. Johnson possesses the common characteristics found among patients suffering from critical limb ischemia as suggested by several clinical demographic studies.  Mr. Johnson’s case enlightens us on the significant threat critical limb ischemia has on high-risk patients. His condition should be managed urgently  consisting of an immediate cessation of smoking  robust control of his cardiovascular risk factors  and appropriate revascularization procedures to salvage the limb and improve his quality of life.  Thank you.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,93,Title: Patient Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 72-year-old male  Mr. Smith  who is an African American  retired from a public transportation job  and a resident of the urban area of Detroit  Michigan. He has a history of heavy smoking and had quit 5 years back. His BMI falls in the overweight category. He has a wife and three grown children  and lives with his spouse in a single-family home.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a long history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both being poorly controlled. He also has a known peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that was diagnosed 8 years ago. There is a recorded history of a myocardial infarction episode approximately 6 years back. He underwent angioplasty along with stent placement in the LAD (left anterior descending artery) at that time. He has been suffering from chronic kidney disease (stage 3) for the past 9 years. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has been on statins for the same.  Current Presentation:  Recently  Mr. Smith presented at the ER with worsening rest pain in his right foot. The pain has been deteriorating over the past two weeks and has significantly disturbed his sleep. On physical examination  the foot is cold with diminished dorsal pedal pulses and noticeable skin discoloration. His non-healing foot ulcer has worsened over the week. He also complains of increasing muscle weakness in the right leg. All these symptoms collectively suggest an escalation of his known PAD to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Relevance:  Critical Limb Ischemia occurs more frequently in males over 50  African Americans  and patients with comorbidities like Diabetes  Hypertension  and atherosclerosis  which corroborates Mr. Smith's demographic and medical data. Studies specify that the prevalence of CLI among patients above 70 years ranges from 500 to 1 200 per million. With the PAD background and these presenting symptoms  the management of Mr. Smith's condition warrants immediate attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,94,Patient Presentation:  Our patient today is Mr. Carl Davis  a 72-years-old African-American male from an urban residence  presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The reason for Mr. Davis' admission is persistent discomfort and pain in his right lower limb that he describes as being worsening over the past 6 months. The persistent pain has been affecting his sleep pattern and daily activities considerably  indicating severity.  Mr. Davis has a significant past medical history. He was diagnosed earlier with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 7 years ago and has been under treatment. In addition  he has Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years and a 20-year history of hypertension. He is an active smoker  with a 30 pack-year smoking history  which adds to his risk profile. Moreover  he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 8 years ago.   As per recent studies  CLI is notably prevalent in patients with PAD  history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension – conditions Mr. Davis has all been diagnosed with. Furthermore  African-Americans  like Mr. Davis  have been observed to have a higher-than-average prevalence of PAD  placing them at increased risk for CLI. His history of CABG suggests a propensity towards cardiovascular complications.  In conclusion  Mr. Davis’ demographic factors  personal habits  and significant medical history place him at a heightened risk for CLI. Immediate and appropriate intervention is critical to prevent any severe complications such as limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,95,Presentation of the Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics  The patient is a 74-year-old African American male named Mr. John Smith. He is a retiree living in the urban region of Miami  Florida  with his wife. He was a heavy smoker for most of his life  regularly consuming one to two packs a day before quitting 10 years ago. He has a history of an unhealthy diet which was high in saturated fats and cholesterol. He is primarily sedentary  with a history of minimal physical activity  and is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. His socio-economic status is moderate.  Medical History   Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history. This includes hypertension which was diagnosed 18 years ago  type 2 diabetes for the last 13 years  and hyperlipidemia for the past 15 years. The records show that all these conditions have been poorly controlled. He has a notable history of cardiac disease  having suffered a myocardial infarction two years ago. He has also been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (stage 3) five years ago. Five years prior to the present time  he had a right carotid endarterectomy due to carotid artery stenosis.  Presenting Issue   Mr. Smith came in presenting with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI). These include persistent unilateral leg pain at rest  which has been troubling him for approximately two weeks. He has also noticed a non-healing ulcer on the distal aspect of the same leg. There is no report of trauma linked to this ulcer. Mr. Smith also reports intermittent claudication  which has been worsening gradually.   Given his age  race  fixed risk factors (such as a history of smoking and obesity)  unfavorable lifestyle  and established co-morbid conditions (such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  myocardial infarction  and chronic kidney disease)  Mr. Smith falls into the high-risk category for developing CLI as seen in the literature review. As his healthcare providers  immediate attention and an integrated therapeutic strategy is imperative to manage this serious condition to avoid limb loss  improve the quality of life  and prolong survival.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,96,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Case Presentation  Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African-American male presenting to the emergency department with severe rest pain in his right leg and a superficial wound on his right foot that has not shown any signs of healing over the past few weeks. He reports the wound causes excruciating pain at rest and during the night  often disturbing his sleep. He has noticed a growing discoloration around the wound and complains about coldness in his affected limb.   Demographics:  Mr. Johnson is retired and lives alone since his wife deceased a few years ago. He is originally from Dallas  Texas. He is currently smoking  has a history of heavy drinking  though he had quit approximately 12-14 years ago.  Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a significant past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus that has been poorly controlled over the last decade. Complications related to his diabetes include peripheral neuropathy and chronic kidney disease. Furthermore  he has been battling Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia for the past 15 years. He has been prescribed statins and antihypertensive medication but is inconsistent with medication intake.   His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases; his father died following a myocardial infarction in his late 50s and his older brother has a history of stroke.   This patient's medical history  demographic  and lifestyle factors intersect to position him in an elevated risk category for peripheral arterial disease and Critical Limb Ischemia. We’ll need immediate intervention to manage the condition and prevent the progression to gangrene or other serious complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,97,"Patient Presentation  The patient is Mr. Ahmed Saad  a 68-year-old man of Middle Eastern descent  currently residing in San Francisco  California. He's moderately obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. Mr. Saad is a retired construction worker and he used to be a heavy smoker for 35 years. He quit about five years ago when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Mr. Saad presents with a three-day history of severe pain in his right lower extremity  particularly below the knee  extending to the foot. The pain has been continuous  throbbing  and unrelieved with over-the-counter pain medications. He reports repetitive episodes of coldness and pallor of the foot  with non-healing sores on the toes. He has also noticed a decrease in mobility  feeling some sort of """"heavyness"""" in his leg  particularly when walking.  Medical History  Mr. Saad was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago and hypertension for approximately ten years. In addition  he's been managing hyperlipidemia for the past six years. He has not been regularly compliant with his medications  often missing doses due to forgetfulness. He also admits to a poor diet  marked by excessive consumption of high sugar and high-fat foods.  Family history is significant for vascular diseases. His father had peripheral artery disease (PAD) and his older brother died from a stroke. He has two daughters in their 30s with no health problems.  Past surgical history is significant for a right inguinal hernia repair about 12 years ago.  Social History   He lives alone in his own place  following the death of his wife 3 years ago due to breast cancer. He does not partake in regular physical activity partly due to his leg pain. He used to smoke two packs of cigarettes each day for 35 years but quit five years ago.  Given his history of long-term cigarette smoking  coupled with his poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  the patient is at high risk for peripheral artery disease and its most severe form – critical limb ischemia (CLI). His symptoms of leg pain at rest  non-healing wounds  and changes in skin color and temperature are consistent with this diagnosis.   His condition needs urgent attention due to the high risk of amputation  associated with CLI  if not handled promptly."
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,98,Presentation of Patient:  Patient's Name: Mr. Robert Jenkins Age: 67 years old Gender: Male Occupational History: Retired Teacher Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with severe pain in the right lower limb  even while at rest  which he rated as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain has been increasing in intensity over the past week and is accompanied by non-healing ulcers on the foot and visible discoloration  indicating critical limb ischemia.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jenkins has a history of smoking for the past 40 years  with 20 pack-years recorded. He has had hypertension for 20 years  which has been well controlled on medication. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  which has resulted in neuropathy  as well in some nephropathy  for which he has been taking Metformin and Enalapril respectively. In correlation with this  he has peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed five years ago. He also has a past history of myocardial infarction about three years ago  with subsequent stent placement done.  Family History: The patient's father died of a heart attack at the age of 74  and his mother had stroke at 70. His younger brother  now 65  has been diagnosed with PAD.  Lifestyle: Mr. Jenkins lives with his wife and leads a sedentary lifestyle. He reported that he drinks alcohol socially  and quit smoking after the heart attack three years ago.  BMI: 28 (overweight)  Given the current presentation and past medical history of cardiovascular diseases  advanced age  diabetes  and history of smoking and drinking  it appears Mr. Jenkins is a fairly typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia  as supported by existing literature data. There is a high risk of amputation unless rapid diagnosis and treatment are undertaken.  
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,99,Title: Critical Limb Ischaemia: A Case Study  Patient Introduction  Our Patient  Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old African American male  presented symptoms synonymous with the late-stage peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  known as Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI). As per population studies  PAD has been found to increase with age and is more commonly observed in male patients and African American individuals  thus demonstrating a representative demographic trend.  Clinical History  Mr. Doe has a significant history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 20 years and smoking for around 30 years. Patients like Mr. Doe  with long-standing diabetes and a history of smoking  are at a higher risk for PAD and consequently  CLI. In fact  over 50% of patients with CLI have a history of smoking and approximately one-third of all CLI patients have diabetes. Mr. Doe also has a medical history of high cholesterol levels and hypertension  thus  increasing his risk of developing atherosclerosis and subsequent PAD.  Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Doe reported severe pain in his lower limbs  especially the left foot  even at rest. He has also been experiencing non-healing ulcers on his left foot. On examination  there was notable decreased sensation in the foot  absence of pedal pulses  and mild foot pallor. This consistent pain  known as rest pain  coupled with foot ulcers and poor circulatory signs are characteristic symptoms of CLI  showing a clear manifestation of the disease severity.  Critical Condition:   Mr. Doe's condition is critical  with the high probabilities of limb amputation or even risk of cardiovascular events if left untreated. Interventional steps  including lifestyle modifications  medication management  or surgical interventions like percutaneous angioplasty  atherectomy  or bypass surgery  are being considered urgently to save the already endangered limb.  In conclusion  Mr. John Doe accurately represents the demographics and medical history often observed in CLI patients. His case underscores the urgency to diagnose and manage CLI promptly to mitigate its severe complications  improve quality of life  and decrease mortality.
Critical Limb Ischemia,1,100,Slide 1: Introduction  Our case for discussion today involves a patient presenting with Critical Limb Ischemia.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 78-year-old African-American male who resides in an urban area  reflective of the higher prevalence of CLI observed among male and African-American populations.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for over two decades. He is also a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history  reflecting the high association of CLI with tobacco use  diabetes  and hypertension.  Slide 4: More Past Medical History  Additionally  he has a history of peripheral artery disease and has suffered a previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction  indicative of his prolonged atherosclerotic disease. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease with his father having suffered a stroke.  Slide 5: Symptom Presentation  The patient presented with severe pain in his right lower leg  which worsens when the leg is elevated and subsides when the leg is hanging down. He also complained of non-healing sores on his right foot.  Slide 6: Clinical Findings  On examination  the skin of the right lower limb appeared cool with shiny skin and hair loss. Doppler showed significantly reduced or absent ankle-brachial index on the right side. Foot pulses were also diminished. These clinical features align with the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Slide 7: Conclusion  The diagnosis of this African-American male patient  with a risk profile marked by long-term smoking  diabetes  hypertension and PAD  falls in line with the demographics most likely to present with CLI as found in literature. His severe  chronic disease necessitates aggressive management to prevent limb loss and reduce cardiovascular risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,1,"Patient Presentation  Mr. Jenkins is a 68-year-old African-American male  a retired bus driver  who presents to the Vascular Clinic with complaints of severe pain in his left lower limb. The pain  which is present even at rest  has been ongoing for approximately 3 weeks. Mr. Jenkins rates the pain as a '9' on a scale of 10 and notes that he has difficulty moving due to the discomfort. He also mentions that he experiences occasional numbness in his leg. He states that he notices the skin on his left foot is paler in color than his right foot and his left foot feels cooler to touch. He also notes a non-healing ulceration started on his left heel two weeks ago.  Past medical history is significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He has been a smoker  at a pace of one pack of cigarettes per day  for over 40 years  but is currently trying hard to quit. He admits non-compliance with his diabetic medications and diet. His most recent hemoglobin A1C is reported at 9.1.  In terms of family history  Mr. Jenkins' father had a """"heart problem""""  but the patient isn't sure of the specific diagnosis. His mother suffered a stroke in her late 60s.  Regarding social history  Mr. Jenkins reports that his diet is poor in fruits and vegetables and is selective heavy in meat consumption  which he worries might not be helping his health condition. He lives alone and is socially active within his local community. His alcohol use is limited to occasional social drinking. He does not use illicit substances.   The combination of his symptoms  past medical history of peripheral artery disease risk factors  and physical examination findings are congruent with a clinical manifestation of critical limb ischemia."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,2,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  55-pack-year smoking history  and peripheral artery disease  presents with reports of increasing pain in his right lower extremity  primarily at rest. The pain’s severity has escalated over the past two months  resulting in sleep disturbances. He also mentions a non-healing skin ulcer on his right foot arch that began about a month ago. He denies any trauma to the area but notes discoloration of his limbs  especially his leg. These symptoms have significantly impaired his walking ability  despite which he hasn’t sought any professional medical help due to lack of medical insurance. He tried using over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain relief with limited success. The patient is a retired mechanic  lives by himself and is dependent on social security for income. He has been non-compliant with his diabetic and hypertensive medications due to financial constraints. His family history is noteworthy for cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,3,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old African American male presented to the clinic with a severe cramping pain in the left calf that has been persisting for over 1 month. The pain becomes more severe after walking a few blocks and is only slightly relieved after rest. He also reported that he occasionally experienced non-healing ulcers on his left foot and sometimes wakes up at night due to leg pain  needing to hang his leg over the side of the bed to attain relief.   The patient has a known history of Type II diabetes for 10 years and is still managing it with Metformin. Other past medical history includes hypertension that has been controlled via medication for several years and a 40-years history of smoking  in which the patient typically consumes a pack a day. He has been obese for over 20 years with a BMI of 32.4. The patient admits he is not engaged in regular physical activity due to his employment as a long-haul truck driver.  The patient's father passed away at 69 due to a sudden heart attack  and his mother had a history of peripheral artery disease prior to her death at the age of 77. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,4,A 68-year-old African American male with a known history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Hypertension presented to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his right lower limb. The pain had been worsening over the last three weeks and was progressively impairing his ability to walk. He also noticed the appearance of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot that developed about two weeks ago. He has been compliant with his medication regime  which includes Metformin and Lisinopril. He has a 45-year history of smoking two packs a day but quit five years ago. He denies any history of coronary artery disease  stroke  or cancer. He had a lower limb angioplasty performed 7 years ago on the same leg. His family history is significant for peripheral artery disease in his father.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,5,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jones is a 68-year-old African-American female  who presents to the clinic with complaints of severe pain in her left lower extremity  particularly her foot  which she rates as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale  even at rest. She reports the pain has progressively gotten worse over the past two weeks. Furthermore  she reveals having intermittent claudication for the last six months that typically occurred after walking two or three blocks.  Over the past few days  she has started to notice that her left foot feels cooler than the right one. She also discloses an open non-healing wound on her left heel with irregular edges  black discoloration  and mild foul-smelling discharge. On further questioning  she shares that she is a former smoker who quit approximately 10 years ago  after a 35-year history of smoking a pack a day.   She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which she mentions has not been well controlled. She takes oral medication for her hypertension and diabetes  and a statin for her dyslipidemia. She denies any family history indicative of peripheral artery disease.   On physical examination  her left foot displays diminished pulses  pallor  coolness to touch  and a non-palpable dorsalis pedis artery. A necrotic  non-healing ulcer is noted on her left heel.   Given significant risk factors including age  race  smoking history  poorly controlled diabetes  and hypertension  and her symptoms and physical findings  Ms Jones likely has critical limb ischemia. Immediate attention and further evaluation are deemed necessary to prevent limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,6,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 75-year-old African-American male transport driver who was referred to the vascular clinic by his local general practitioner due to rest pain in the right lower limb. He had been experiencing a chronic history of severe pain in the calf and foot  worsening during the night. Specifically  Mr. Johnson described the pain as a throbbing discomfort  which was relieved on dependency.   Additionally  he had noticed intermittent claudication (IC) over the past 3 months  specifically while getting off his truck  with the pain-free walking distance being decreased dramatically. Moreover  he described the foot as """"turning blue"""" at times and noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on the medial aspect of his right 1st toe. He also mentioned unintentional weight loss over the past month.  Mr. Johnson has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and high cholesterol for around 10 years  which has been inconsistently treated due to his non-compliance with medications. He had no history of previous surgeries. He smokes around 10 cigarettes per day and reports a history of heavy drinking.  On examination  there were multiple visible ulcers on the distal right foot with some necrosis of 1st toe. Auscultation showed diminished bilateral femoral pulses and the right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable. There was no edema  but significant skin discoloration was evident.   After potential differential diagnoses  the patient's presentation and examination was suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient was requested to undergo further examinations for confirmation and further management."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,7,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 75-year-old African American male  retired truck driver  presenting with excruciating bilateral lower extremity pain that has been progressively worsening over the past few months. The pain is reported to be severe  8/10  constant and unrelieved by rest. It occurs both at rest and during activity  with the night time pain being particularly severe  often waking him up from sleep. The pain currently restricts his mobility to a large extent and he is wheelchair bound. He also reports noticeable loss of hair on his lower limbs  and non-healing  painful ulcers on his right foot.   Relevant Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a documented history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents  and chronic hypertension. He has been a heavy smoker  consuming approximately 1 pack per day for more than 50 years  although he quit a couple years prior. His latest lipid profile revealed dyslipidemia; high levels of LDL  low HDL cholesterol  and high triglycerides. He also has a history of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) and was previously treated with bypass surgery in the left leg around 5 years ago.   Family History:   Both of his parents passed away from heart disease  his father at the age of 82 and mother at the age of 75. His brother  now 77 years old  recently was diagnosed with PAD.   Social History:  He resides with his elderly wife. They have two children  both live out of state. He quit his job as a truck driver at 65 and retired due to health concerns. He has limited physical and social activities due to his symptoms. He is a non-alcoholic  but did indulge in heavy smoking in the past.   Considering his age  race  diabetes  history of smoking  dyslipidemia  hypertension and family history of heart disease  Mr. Smith fits into a typical demographic group with a high risk of critical limb ischemia. This case warrants immediate medical attention and management to prevent the progression to gangrenous changes and the threat of limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,8,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 75-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with worsening pain in his right leg. He complained of severe aching/burning pain regularly described as resting pain  nocturnal in nature  which forced him to dangle his leg over the side of the bed to get some temporary relief. On onset  he noticed it lasted only minutes but gradually increased to present state where it lasted for several hours. He also mentioned an existing wound on his right foot that was non-healing for the last 3 months. Upon inspection  the wound appeared to be a shallow  non-bleeding  painful ulcer with pale granulation tissue located on the heel  making him reluctant to bear weight on the affected limb.  His past medical history revealed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  with poor glucose control (latest HbA1c: 8.7%)  and hypertension. He admitted adherence to medication is somewhat irregular because of perceived side-effects. He confessed a history of smoking approximately 10-12 cigarettes a day for the last 50 years  but quit two years ago after being diagnosed with mild COPD. His family history revealed that his father had undergone a below-knee amputation in his late 70s  due to """"poor circulation"""".  With these complaints  a history suggesting long-term tobacco use  poorly controlled diabetes  personal and familial evidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  the patient was suspected to be suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia. The presentation aligns widely with what is seen in epidemiological studies – a preponderance in males  Hispanic ethnicity  advanced age  history of diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and familial tendency."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,9,Patient Presentation: Mr. James Harris  a 68-year-old African-American male presents to the emergency department with intense rest pain in his right lower leg along with non-healing ulcers of two weeks’ duration. The patient reports that the pain is worse when he is in bed. He also complains of feeling unusual coldness in the affected limb  and has experienced significant weight loss over recent months. He states the pain is continuous and severe  rating it as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale and not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics.   Relevant Past Medical History: On investigation of his medical history  it is discovered that Mr. Harris has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the past ten years  hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Additionally  he has been smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago  with no residual deficits. He mentions that he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) a year ago but did not adhere to prescribed medications consistently. His mother suffered from stroke at the age of 73  suggesting a possible family history of vascular disease. He has no known drug allergies.  Demographic Details: Mr. Harris lives alone in a two-bedroom apartment in the city. He is retired and was previously employed as a bus driver. He has 2 siblings  three adult children  and 2 grandchildren. His wife passed away five years ago. He does not engage in routine physical activity and his diet is mainly fast food due to convenience and affordability. He has Medicare as his health insurance.   The combination of Mr. Harris’s age  ethnicity  past medical history  smoking habits  and non-compliance with the prescribed medication put him in a high-risk category for developing critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,10,Patient Presentation:  A 75-year-old Caucasian male presents to a vascular surgery outpatient clinic with a complaint of rest pain in his right lower extremity. He describes this pain as a severe burning sensation that typically worsens at night  preventing him from sleeping unless his leg is dangling over the side of the bed. The patient first noted intermittent claudication starting 6 months ago during his regular walk  which progressed into persistent pain even when resting.  He mentions that he has noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe over the past month and that the skin on his foot feels cool to the touch. He has a 40-year history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which he manages with oral hypoglycemic.   Additionally  he has a 50-pack-year smoking history and was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 20 years ago  managed through his prescribed statin and beta-blocker. He does not have a history of myocardial infarction  stroke  kidney disease  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and he is independent for all his living activities.  He has no known drug allergies. He lives alone and drinks alcohol socially. His family history is significant for peripheral artery disease; his father had a below-knee amputation at the age of 65. The patient is scared of the possibility of amputation and is currently seeking interventions that can save his limb.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,11,Patient Presentation:  Mr. JH is a 72-year-old African American male who presents with a three-week history of a non-healing wound on his right foot associated with rest pain. The pain is described as severe  located in the calf and foot  and worse at night which often wakes him up from sleep. The pain often alleviates somewhat when he hangs his leg off the bed. He denies any associated symptoms like fever  numbness or tingling sensation  but admits to having noticed a change in color of the foot and a decreased temperature. He also reports weight loss due to loss of appetite secondary to pain. Upon examination  a gangrenous ulcer is noted on the dorsal aspect of the right foot. Peripheral pulses in the right foot are not palpable and there is evidence of hair loss over the shin and thin shiny skin. He lives alone  is a retired factory worker  smokes half-a-pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years  and occasionally drinks alcohol.  His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for which he takes metformin  and hypertension that is managed with amlodipine. He also had a previous heart attack 3 years ago. He reports poor compliance with medications and irregular follow-ups with his primary care physician due to financial issues. He has no known drug allergies. Recent lab work revealed an HbA1c of 9.3% and LDL cholesterol of 150 mg/dl.   This presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to peripheral arterial disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,12,Patient Presentation:   A 79-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department complaining of worsening rest pain in his left leg  which has intensified over the last few days. The pain is severe and has caused multiple sleep disruptions. He has noticed some ulcerations on his left foot that are not healing. He also mentions a sense of coldness in his lower left limb  particularly in his foot.    Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 25 years  and is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 30 years. He also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years ago during a routine evaluation for an unrelated issue  but follow-Up and management have been challenging due to financial constraints  as the patient could not afford medications and regular health care visits.   Family History: The patient's father deceased due to myocardial infarction at age 70 and he has a brother with diagnosed PAD  currently undergoing treatment.  Social History: The patient is retired  lives with his wife  and has three adult children. He used to work in a factory  and his exposure to occupational hazards is unclear. He denies any use of alcohol or illegal substances.   Upon physical examination  there is notable pallor and absence of distal pulses on the left lower limb  with the presence of multiple non-healing ulcers on the foot. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. His vitals show blood pressure at 145/95 mmHg  heart rate at 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation at 97% on room air.   Review of his recent lab results shows poor glycemic control with a Hemoglobin A1c of 8.2% and elevated lipids with an LDL of 160 mg/dL. The EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy. The rest of his results  including CBC  kidney function  and liver function  are within normal limits.   The patient's clinical presentation and examination findings suggest worsening PAD  likely progressed to critical limb ischemia (CLI). Such patients require urgent attention to prevent limb loss. Given his significant history of smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and poorly controlled diabetes  this patient is at a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well.   Note: The patient's demographic representation  including age  ethnicity  and the mentioned lifestyle factors  aligns with literature showing CLI prevalence is higher in elderly populations  males  African Americans  smokers  and patients with underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,13,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thompson is a 72-year-old African-American male who presents to the clinic reporting a 3-month history of constant  severe pain in his right lower extremity. He describes the pain as """"burning"""" and it is localized to his foot and calf. The pain is present at rest and is particularly bothersome at night. He notes that it eases somewhat when he dangles his foot off the bed. He also reports a non-healing ulcer on his right foot that he first noticed about a month ago.  Mr. Thompson has a past medical history that is significant for type 2 diabetes which has been poorly controlled over the years  hypertension  and a 35-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily. Despite repeated counseling  Mr. Thompson has been unsuccessful in his attempts to quit smoking. He also reports peripheral artery disease diagnosed about 2 years ago.  The patient has no known drug allergies. His current medications include metformin  atorvastatin  aspirin  and ramipril.  On physical examination  Mr. Thompson's right foot is noticeably cooler than his left. His right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are barely palpable. The noted ulcer on his right foot is approximately 2 cm in diameter  with blackened tissue noted at the borders.  His blood workup shows a Hemoglobin A1c of 9.5%  indicating poor control of his diabetes.  This presentation is consistent with critical limb ischemia. The patient should be referred for additional vascular studies and likely revascularization. His diabetes control should be aggressively managed  and serious efforts to discontinue smoking should be undertaken."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,14,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. David Millerson  a 68-year-old African-American male  reports to the emergency department with severe pain in his right lower extremity. He describes the pain as """"burning"""" and states it gets worse at rest. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on his right toe  which has been present for the past three weeks  and increased cold sensitivity in the right foot. He discloses he's a two-pack-a-day smoker  continuing for about 45 years.  On examination  the pulse in the right lower limb is feeble. Skin on the lower limb shows signs of pallor and the toe ulcer looks poorly perfused. There is no touched sensation around the site. Both are signs typical of peripheral artery disease.  His medical history includes being on treatment for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 8 years  controlled with metformin and lisinopril. He also has a known history of dyslipidemia managed with simvastatin. He underwent angioplasty of the coronary artery 5 years ago due to a myocardial infarction. He denies any known drug allergy.  The combination of rest pain  non-healing ulcers  along with the patient's age  ethnicity  long history of smoking  and comorbid conditions like hypertension  diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia and previous coronary artery disease alerts to the potential diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. "
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,15,Patient Presentation:   Mr. J is a 73-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic with a chief complaint of severe rest pain in his right foot  which has been ongoing for the past two weeks. He reports the pain is constant  8/10 on the pain scale  and is relieved only slightly by hanging his foot off the edge of the bed at night.   Mr. J also discloses that he has noticed a non-healing wound on his right big toe becoming progressively worse over the past month. The patient has a history of heaviness and fatigue in the lower extremities with minimal exertion that has been persistent for the past few months.  Mr. J has a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a 40-pack-year smoking history. He reports inconsistently using prescribed medications due to the inability to afford them.   Family history is significant for peripheral artery disease and stroke in his father. Social history is significant for prior occupational exposure to toxins and heavy metals in an industrial setting. Mr. J indicates that he has been living a mostly sedentary lifestyle since his retirement five years ago. He is a widower and lives alone  with the nearest family member living in another state.  On physical examination  the right lower extremity is cooler than the left  with notable pallor on elevation and rubor on dependency. Capillary refill time is delayed (>3 seconds). The non-healing ulcer on the right big toe is evident  about 3 cm in diameter with defined edges and blackish discoloration at the center.  Based on his symptoms  past medical history  family history  the nature of the non-healing wound  and physical examination findings  Mr. J may be suffering from critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic investigations and prompt management are indicated for this patient.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,16,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Ramírez is a 74-year-old Hispanic male presenting with complaints of rest pain in the right lower extremity for three weeks  the pain is reportedly severe  throbbing in nature  and intensifies at night when his leg is in a horizontal position. The pain is somewhat relieved when he hangs his leg in a downward position. The patient also reports non-healing ulcers on the right foot  located at the tips of his right first and second toes  with minimal discharge but associated with marked pain.  His past medical history is significant for type 2 Diabetes  diagnosed 15 years ago and controlled by Metformin. He also reports a 40-year history of tobacco use (approximately 20 cigarettes/day) but quit five years ago. The patient also suffers from chronic hypertension controlled by Lisinopril and Amlodipine  hyperlipidemia managed by Atorvastatin  and has a previous history of a transient ischemic attack 6 years prior. There's no known history of heart or kidney diseases.  On physical examination  there is diminished right pedal pulse and markedly decreased sensation in the right lower extremity. Skin examination reveals a couple of non-healing  small ulcerations at the tips of the right first and second toes. Further testing should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia and an appropriate treatment plan formed based on the results. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,17,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Sanford is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of smoking for the last 45 years and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. He presents to the emergency department with severe resting pain throughout his right lower extremity  extending from his hip to his toes  which has progressively worsened over the past two weeks. Pain is relieved with the limb in a dependent position. He also reports that he has noticed a dark discoloration of his toes and coolness of the foot  along with non-healing sores over his calf.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Sanford has a history of hypertension for the last 20 years  managed with two antihypertensives; lisinopril and amlodipine. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years ago following similar complaints but failed to follow through with suggested lifestyle changes and medication. He also suffers from intermittent claudication in his left lower extremity. His diabetes mellitus is treated with metformin  but typically poorly controlled due to non-compliance with diet and medication. He has a history of myocardial infarction 10 years back  for which he had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting. He is on aspirin and atorvastatin since then. He has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  Mr. Sanford lives alone following his wife's death three years back. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years  and quit just 1 year ago. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His diet is predominately fast food  and he rarely exercises. He has four biological children  two of them are diagnosed with hypertension and one with hyperlipidaemia.  Discussion:  As per the literature  the demographics and past medical history of Mr. Sanford are consistent with a typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Increased age  male gender  smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  peripheral artery disease  earlier cardiovascular events  and family history of cardiovascular disease have all been associated with an increased risk of CLI. The majority of CLI patients have multiple comorbidities  particularly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. His presentation also corresponds with the typical CLI symptoms  such as persistent non-traumatic lower limb rest pain  non-healing wounds  and noticeable discoloration of the extremity.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,18,Patient Information: Mr. John  a 70-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer  presents to the hospital with severe pain in his left lower extremity.  Chief Complaint: Mr. John reports that the pain in his left leg has been progressing over the past few months. The pain initially started as intermittent but now persistently present at rest. He also noticed non-healing sores on his left foot.  Past Medical History: A known case of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years which is reasonably controlled with medication  and hypertension for which he is on medication. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and obesity. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and was managed with coronary angioplasty and stent placement. He has a distant history of cerebrovascular accident with residual right-sided weakness. He's also diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease 2 years back but did not follow treatment.  Family History: His father had a stroke and his mother died from myocardial infarction. His brother has peripheral arterial disease too.  Physical Examination: Mr. John's physical examination revealed darkened skin on his left foot along with the presence of non-healing ulcers. His left foot appeared cooler compared to the right. Peripheral pulses in the left foot were barely palpable.  This is a representative example of a patient presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is a serious form of peripheral arterial disease and elderly male  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke)  and a positive family history are all risk factors that make this case typical for CLI. These demographics  along with the patient’s African American ethnicity  align with the typical demographic representation of CLI patients  as found in literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,19,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Gomez  a 72-year-old Latina female  presents to the emergency department with severe  constant pain in her left lower leg that has persisted for the past three days. The pain worsens when she lies down and is somewhat relieved upon hanging her leg off the bed. She rates the pain a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. On physical examination  the leg appears pale with noticeable hair loss. Pulses are weak on palpation.   Her medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which she was diagnosed with approximately 15 years ago. Her last Hemoglobin A1c three months ago was 9.0%  indicating that her blood glucose levels have not been optimally controlled. She has been on medication for these conditions including metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin  but admits to often forgetting her morning doses. She has no history of smoking  but she does consume moderate amounts of alcohol.   Her family history is notable for a father who had peripheral artery disease and an amputation  as well as a sister who recently suffered a heart attack.   Based on her symptoms  physical examination  and medical history  there is a high suspicion for critical limb ischemia. Immediate intervention is required to prevent possible limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,20,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alvarez is a 72-year-old Hispanic man who presents to the hospital with a 2-week history of progressive pain in his lower extremities. Initially  he experienced consistent discomfort in his right leg during walking which he attributes to his old age. Additionally  he noticed that his right foot appears darker than usual  and he describes feeling cold to touch. He also reports having absent pulses in his right foot which greatly alarmed him. He refers that he feels numbness  tingling  and has difficulty moving his foot.  Mr. Alvarez's past medical history includes a 20-year history of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease. He's been a lifelong smoker  with a pack/day habit for the past 50 years. He was prescribed medication for diabetes and PAD but he admits that he sometimes forgets to take his pills. He also states that his father died of a heart attack at age 65  and his elder brother had a history of stroke at age 70.  He had no known drug allergies. He lives alone  is widowed with 3 adult children living out of state. He used to be a machine operator until his retirement 7 years ago.  Physical examination reveals an underweight male with a BMI of 19. His lower extremity revealed pallor  cyanosis  and shiny skin with sparse hair on his right foot. There were also sores on his right foot which didn't heal for more than three weeks. His right foot is cooler than the left. Pulses were absent in the right lower limb and decreased in the left. The Doppler ultrasound showed poor blood flow to his right lower extremity  confirming the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  In light of the patient's advanced age  uncontrolled diabetes  long history of smoking  and symptoms consistent with severe peripheral arterial disease  the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is highly suspected. The patient was referred for prompt angiography and potential revascularization. His diabetic control management was also reinforced as part of the comprehensive care plan.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,21,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alberto Dominguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic with severe pain in his left lower limb. He reports the pain has gradually increased over the past few months  with it being more profound at rest and often disturbing his sleep. Mr. Dominguez also notes that he has a non-healing ulcer on the sole of his left foot that has persisted for nearly two months  despite regular cleaning and bandaging. The patient has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  uncontrolled hypertension  and high cholesterol. He is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history  quit five years ago  but admits to ongoing alcohol consumption. Previous investigations reveal moderate peripheral artery disease. This is his first visit concerning this type of severe pain and non-healing ulcer.   Mr. Dominguez resides with his wife and is retired but shares he has considerably restricted his physical activity due to the pain. He also mentions that his left foot often feels cold and that he has noticed his toenails growing slowly. He denies experiencing any recent trauma to the affected foot. His current medications include Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 20mg daily for cholesterol.   From the above-presented symptoms and medical history  a suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is raised.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,22,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Earl Johnson  a 72-year-old African American male  walks into the clinic presenting with severe pain in his left lower limb. He reports that the pain has been persistent for the past three months  but recently escalated to 'unbearable' and is now preventing him from walking or even sleeping. The pain is not relieved with rest and has a numbing quality.  The patient also reports intermittent episodes of skin discoloration  turning pale when cold and blue when warm. There are non-healing ulcers on his left foot and he reports instances of coldness in his toes. Mr. Johnson also has a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension  controlled by medication  and type II diabetes  for which he follows a dietary regimen and takes oral antidiabetic drugs. He had a stroke three years ago for which he underwent rehabilitation and currently able to perform his day-day activities.  In summary  we have a 72-year-old African American male  with a background of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and stroke who is presenting with severe lower limb pain and non-healing ulcers indicative of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,23,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alberto Rodriguez  a 71-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the outpatient clinic with a two-month history of intense cramp-like pain in his left lower leg  especially when walking short distances. His pain has progressively increased during this time and recently he has started experiencing pain at rest  particularly at night. He describes it as a severe  sharp burning sensation which often makes it difficult for him to sleep. There's no apparent trauma to the leg.  In addition  he reports that he has noticed his foot becoming paler with some skin color changes  especially when his leg is elevated. He also complains of feeling cold in that foot compared to his right one  and difficulty in feeling temperature or touch in the area. His left foot's small wounds have been slow to heal too.  Mr. Rodriguez has significant past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and smoking (30-pack years). He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are relatively controlled with medication. He has no past surgeries  no known allergies  and there was no major illness or operation in his family. He reports no alcohol use and non-recreational drug use.  On examination  the left lower leg appeared to have lost hair  with the skin appearing shiny and tight. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse were not palpable on the left foot  but normal on the right foot. The distal extremity was cold to touch.  This patient's presentation of rest pain  color changes  and poor wound healing in the left lower extremity suggests critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously reduces blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to causing severe symptoms. This is further supported by previous diagnoses of common comorbid risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,24,Patient Presentation:  An African American male  aged 68  presents to the clinic complaining of severe  progressive pain in his right lower leg  especially when at rest. He defines the pain as 8 on a scale of 10. The patient also reports he has had a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum of his right foot for the last six weeks. He also mentions feeling coldness in the same foot and generalized weakness in the right leg. The patient describes these symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past 3 months leading to difficulty walking even short distances due to pain.  His past medical history reveals he is a long-term  30 pack-year  smoker and has a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2  for which he has been taking Metformin. He has had uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years managed with Lisinopril and Chlorthalidone. A history of Hyperlipidemia is reported as well  managed through diet and Atorvastatin.   Social history reveals lack of regular physical activity  consuming an unhealthy diet  and living alone with a caregiver only visiting once a day. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  His family history includes his father with a history of stroke and peripheral artery disease  and his mother died of myocardial infarction at 72.  The above constellation of symptoms  especially in the context of his advancing age  smoking history  and poorly controlled systemic diseases  raises concerns for Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,25,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African American male presenting to the Emergency Department with severe pain in his left lower extremity. The pain is predominantly at rest with some minimal relief when the leg is dependent. He reports this has been ongoing for about a week now  and has been progressively getting worse. The pain is associated with skin color change to a pale hue  decreased temperature  presence of non-healing ulcers on the foot  and marked impairment in walking.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a significant history of 15-year uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes Metformin 1000mg twice daily. He also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed 5 years ago  managed with Aspirin and Atorvastatin. Other relevant history includes 30 pack-year of smoking with cessation 5 years ago  hypertension  for which he takes Losartan 25 mg everyday and chronic kidney disease stage 3.  Social History:  He lives with his wife and is a retired bus driver. He quit smoking 5 years ago but has a history of heavy smoking for approximately 30 years prior to quitting. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  Discussion:  Mr. Johnson’s demographics  along with his existing comorbidities such as age  race  uncontrolled diabetes  PAD  and past smoking history  are consistent with the profile of patients at high risk for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  as identified in the literature. Poor control of his diabetes and hypertension  alongside his smoking history  places him at an escalated risk. The presence of chronic kidney disease adds another risk factor for the development of CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,26,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jaime Medina  a 73-year-old Hispanic male with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  presents to the clinic today with chronic right lower leg pain. He is a previous 40 pack-year smoker but quit smoking five years ago.  His main concern is a long-standing non-healing ulcer on the right foot that has been worsening over the past two months. He describes his pain as persistent  worsening at night  and often interrupting his sleep. He reports the pain is only relieved temporarily when he dangles his foot over the edge of the bed. He expresses concern about the discoloration of his foot and a noticeable decrease in the temperature of the right foot as compared to his left.  On physical examination  the right foot exhibits a non-healing ulcer about 2 cm in diameter on the plantar surface of the toes with noticeable tissue necrosis and gangrene. Pulses in the right leg are diminished. He is also found to have reduced hair growth  brittle nails  and shiny skin on his lower right leg compared to the left.  On questioning  Mr. Medina also admits to erectile dysfunction  a common symptom in advanced peripheral artery disease which he was too embarrassed to talk about before. The pain in the right leg has severely limited his daily activities  caused considerable distress  and affected his quality of life.  In conclusion  regarding the patient's past medical history  presenting symptoms  and physical examination results  a provisional diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in the right lower extremity is likely. Further investigation via angiography is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent and location of arterial disease for treatment planning.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,27,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Crawford  a 70-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of rest pain in his left lower extremity. His pain has gotten progressively worse over the past several days and is severe enough to disturb his sleep. He reports that his foot feels continuously cold and is accompanied by numbness. Unmanaged Type II Diabetes and untreated Hyperlipidemia for several years are part of his past medical history. He has a habit of tobacco usage of about 50 pack years and has not abstained from it. He has also failed to follow recommended physical activity and dietary plans.  Recently  he noticed occasional non-healing wounds on his toes and progressive blackish discoloration of the toes. No known allergies to medications. Family history was positive for peripheral artery disease (PAD) in his father. On physical examination  his left lower limb was significantly cooler compared to the right. His pulses were absent on the left side below the knee. There was some observable tissue loss and gangrene formation on his toes.  Therefore given Mr. Crawford's demographics  significant smoking history  presence of comorbidities  findings on physical examination and disease progression  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is suspected. His symptoms of rest pain  non-healing wounds  and visible gangrene are all strong indicators of the seriousness of his condition. He needs immediate revascularization intervention to relieve his symptoms and prevent further complications  including possible amputation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,28,Patient Presentation:  An 78-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her left lower leg that has been progressively worsening over the past week. The patient reports that she feels the pain even when she’s resting  particularly at night. She has a known history of type II diabetes mellitus and has been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 50 years. She also has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   On physical examination  the left leg appears pale in comparison to the other leg  and the lower leg is cold to touch. The popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses on the left side are non-palpable. There's a small non-healing ulcer on the left foot measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. No signs of infection are seen currently around the ulcer.   She reports a weight loss of about 10 lbs over the past three months and reduced appetite. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath but admits she has been less active due to left leg pain.   Given her high-risk conditions combined with her presentation  she is suspected to have developed critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,29,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the vascular clinic with chief complaints of significant rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his right foot  more specifically on the toes. The pain worsens at night and is relieved when he dangles his foot off the edge of the bed. He reports the pain has become unbearable over the last four weeks  negatively affecting his quality of life by interrupting his sleep and impairing his mobility.   Mr. Johnson has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus since he was 40  hypertension since he was 45  and hypercholesterolemia since he was 55. These conditions have been poorly controlled due to his inconsistent adherence to prescribed regimens. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He has a family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD).  Physical examination revealed a thin  frail male who appears older than his stated age  and is in evident discomfort. On inspection  his right foot appears pale and cold to touch with observable atrophic skin changes. He has a palpable femoral pulse but weak or absent distal pulses. He has two superficial ulcers  one on the tip of the first toe and another on the dorsum of the foot. No sensory perception in his foot was noticed when tested with a 10g monofilament.  Given his long-standing smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  consistent symptoms  and positive physical examination findings  he is suspected of having critical limb ischemia  the severe form of PAD. He is advised to immediately undertake diagnostic angiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of vascular compromise. This is essential to guide the further management plan  which may include revascularization procedures  to prevent limb loss. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,30,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 72-year-old African American male presenting with the chief complaint of severe rest pain in his right lower extremity while at rest  which intensifies at night. The pain is described as sharp and constant  occurring predominantly in the foot and is alleviated by hanging the leg off the bed. The patient also reports a non-healing ulcer on the lateral aspect of his right foot that he first noticed approximately 5 weeks ago. He denies any history of trauma to the area.  On a scale of 0-10  the patient rates his pain an 8. He reports a 15-pound unintentional weight loss over the last few months due to reduced appetite from pain. He denies any changes in bowel or bladder habits  night sweats  fever or recent travels.  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a 40-pack-year history of smoking  but he quit smoking 5 years ago. The patient has not previously been diagnosed with any vascular diseases. Current medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose aspirin.  On physical exam  the patient is noted to have an absent right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. The right foot is cool to touch and appears pale compared to the left foot.  This history and physical exam are consistent with critical limb ischemia in a patient with significant risk factors for peripheral artery disease  including advanced age  diabetes  hypertension  and a heavy smoking history. The patient represents a demographic (older  African American male  diabetic  hypertensive  heavy smoker) noted to have a higher risk for critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,31,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old African-American male  presents to our facility complaining of severe rest pain in his left lower extremity  particularly below the knee. The pain has been persistent over the last two weeks and has significantly worsened in the last three days  so much so that it has been interrupting his sleep at night. He also mentions about an unhealing small wound on his left big toe he had noticed about a month ago.   Mr. Smith has been a smoker for the last 40 years with an approximate average of a pack of cigarettes per day. In his medical history  he reports a diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 20 years and hypertension for the past 15 years. Both these conditions are managed with oral medications. His compliance with medication though  as per his own admission  has been inconsistent. He also has a past medical history of dyslipidemia.  In his family history  there is a record of cardiovascular disease in both his parents  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his mother due to congestive heart failure at the age of 75. Mr. Smith was also diagnosed as overweight on his previous visit with a body mass index of 28.   Given his current symptoms  past medical history  and longevity of his risk factors  he is financially independent and retired from his job as a secondary school teacher 7 years ago. He lives with his wife; they have two grown-up children who live separately.   His pain  non-healing wound  and history of risk factors point towards a high suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Further evaluation will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate plan of management. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,32,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old African American male  retired truck driver  presents to the general clinic with severe pain in his right leg  which has gotten progressively worse over the last month. The pain is present at rest and notably increases during the night. The patient reports difficulty walking even short distances due to the severity of the pain. Recently  he has noticed non-healing sores on his right foot and discoloration of the leg over the knee.  The patient has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 12 years  poorly controlled  and hypertension managed with medication. He has been a pack-a-day smoker for the past 45 years and has a diet high in saturated fats. He has no known allergies.   Family history is significant for premature cardiovascular disease; his father had a myocardial infarction at age 58  and his older brother had peripheral artery disease diagnosed in his early 60s.   Physical Examination reveals weakened pulses in the right foot and an abnormal ABPI (ankle-brachial pressure index). The right leg shows signs of skin atrophy  loss of hair  and ulcers on the foot with surrounding erythema and localized warmth.   The patient's presentation and history suggest a picture consistent with advanced Peripheral Artery Disease manifesting as Critical Limb Ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,33,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 75-year-old Hispanic male who presented today to the emergency department with a 3-day history of severe pain in his right lower leg. He reports the pain has been constant  unbearable at times  and was not relieved by rest or over-the-counter pain medications. He also notices a cold sensation in that leg and darkening of the skin on his foot. He states he has not injured the leg or foot recently.   Mr. Rodriguez has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 30 years  poorly controlled  with an HbA1c of 8.5% during his recent visit to the clinic 3 weeks ago. He also has peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed 2 years ago  for which he's currently under conservative management. Additionally  he has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He's a former smoker  quitting 10 years ago after a cumulative history of 35 pack-years.   Mr. Rodriguez lives alone and is functionally independent. His medications include Metformin  Aspirin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. Any potential allergies or susceptibilities to antibiotics aren't known.   This presentation is congruent with the clinical picture of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe manifestation of PAD  and Mr. Rodriguez  given his medical history  falls in the highly risk group. It's important to note that CLI is more prevalent in males and significantly associated with age  diabetes  smoking  and hypertension as depicted in Mr. Rodriguez's case. Immediate intervention sought due to the severity of symptoms and the risk for limb loss. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,34,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Edward Williams  a 74-year-old African American male  reports with severe bilateral leg pain that has worsened over the past few weeks. The pain is constant  especially when he is lying down but slightly subsides when he dangles his legs off the bed. The constant nature of the pain has been disturbing his sleep. The patient had a history of continuous smoking for about 50 years  though he stopped five years ago. He confirms a 10-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are relatively well controlled with medications. Additionally  he reveals he had a myocardial infarction about a year ago.  On physical examination  you note that his legs are pale when elevated  and becomes a dusky red when placed in a dependent position. Both his feet are cold to touch with absent peripheral pulses. You note nonhealing ulcers on the toes of both feet.  With these symptoms and signs  he has been suspected to have critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. Despite the relatively good control of his hypertension and diabetes  these chronic conditions make Mr. Williams more susceptible to heart and vascular diseases  with the smoking habit exacerbating the issue.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,35,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Peterson  a 73-year-old African American male  who was a long-term smoker  presents to the emergency department with non-healing ulcers over the lower third of his right leg and which have been present for the past 3-4 weeks. He has tried over-the-counter topical antibiotics with no improvement. He reports progressive pain in his lower right leg  worsening at night which prevents him from attaining a full night's sleep. He also mentions ongoing numbness and weakness in the same leg. The mentioned extremity also feels notably cooler.  His past medical history reveals that he is diabetic (well-controlled)  hypertensive and diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. He also has a history of renal insufficiency  evidenced by creatinine levels consistently above 2mg/dl over the past year. Mr. Peterson further reports recent unintentional weight loss and lack of appetite.  His social history confirms he has quit smoking two years ago after a 40-year pack history but occasionally consumes alcohol. He has been living alone ever since his wife passed away two years ago. He used to be a school teacher and now survives on his pension.   Mr. Peterson admits not really adhering to his prescribed medications due to his forgetful nature and finding it difficult to afford them. His current medication list includes Metformin  Lisinopril  Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel.   Family history is significant for a father who died from myocardial infarction and a sister who has managed Type 2 diabetes. He denies any known family history of stroke  lung  or other cancers.  Given this presentation and history  CLTI (chronic limb-threatening ischemia) is suspected and further diagnostic tests are required to confirm and plan treatment.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,36,Patient Presentation:  Mr. José Diaz  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents himself at the emergency department with severe pain in his right lower leg which has been worsening over the past month. The pain initially started in his calf when walking but has progressed to become continuous. Recently  he has been experiencing the pain even while at complete rest  particularly at night. He reports significant trouble sleeping due to the unbearable pain. Currently  the pain rate is 8 out of 10.  In terms of the patient's personal medical history  Mr. Diaz has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years  for which he has been taking Metformin. He also has a 40-year history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily. He has been on antihypertensive treatment (Lisinopril) for his diagnosed hypertension. Six months ago he experienced a minor stroke from which he has substantially recovered.   The patient also informs that he has been noticing increased discoloration in his right foot  which is very cold to touch. He recently developed a small non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. He denies any trauma to his right leg or foot.  Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father passed away in his early 70s due to myocardial infarction and his older brother has undergone bypass surgery due to severe peripheral artery disease.  He lives alone since his wife passed away 2 years ago  his children check on him regularly and he has home help to assist with daily activities.   This is the first time he is seeking medical attention for the current complaint because he was hoping that the pain would resolve by itself.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,37,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male   Chief Complaint: Severe rest pain in the right leg for the past two weeks  worsened within the last 48 hours. Reports of non-healing ulcers on the right foot that have persisted despite topical treatments over the past month.  Past Medical History:  1. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 for 30 years – poorly controlled with metformin 2. Smoking history of 50 pack years 3. Hypertension for ten years – maintained on amlodipine  4. History of Right-sided Peripheral Artery Disease diagnosed three years ago 5. Previous coronary artery bypass grafting surgery five years ago due to Coronary Artery Disease   Social History: The patient lives with his wife  has a history of heavy smoking although quit smoking one year ago  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a sedentary lifestyle. No known drug allergies.   Clinical Examination: Lower right leg appeared dusky in color with noticeable temperature gradient; multiple non-healing ulcers on right foot - largest measuring 2 cm in diameter  with exposure of deep structures; significant pain on passive movement; distal pulses undetectable in the right lower limb. Blood pressure: 145/85 mmHg  BMI: 28 kg/m2  Blood Sugar: 250mg/dl (fasting).      Family History: Family history of heart disease. No known family history of clotting disorder  stroke  or cancer. Father died in his early 50s due to myocardial infarction.  Further Investigations: Proposed to undergo lower limb angiography and vascular investigations for a complete assessment of the vascular supply and to determine the appropriate treatment process.   Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical presentation  and past medical history  the patient is being managed for critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,38,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alfredo Gutierrez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents himself to the emergency department complaining of severe pain in his right lower leg which has become constant over the past 2 weeks. The pain is persistent  even at rest. He reveals that the slightest movement causes excruciating pain and over the past week  the skin on his leg seems to have developed discoloration. He also states that he has occasional sensations of 'pins and needles' in the same leg.   His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  hypertension for the past 10 years  hyperlipidemia  and a smoking habit of 50-pack year. He also underwent angioplasty in the left coronary artery 3 years back. He is a retired civil engineer  leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle  and finds it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.   Most of his conditions have been poorly controlled due to inconsistent access to medical help  largely attributable to austere financial conditions and lack of good medical coverage. Therefore  he hasn't had many regular consultations over the last few years. His current medications include Metformin and Lisinopril but his adherence to medication regimen is not reliable.  The patient is accompanied by his son who confirms his father's poor compliance with medical treatment and adds that a visible non-healing wound has developed on the distal portion of his right foot. The son also expresses concern about his father's decreasing appetite and a noticeable weight loss over the past few months.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,39,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Smith is a 72-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe rest pain in her left lower extremity that has lasted for the past few weeks. The pain is relentless and increases when she is in a supine position or when her leg is elevated. She describes it as a constant  sharp  burning sensation in her calf and foot.  Her past medical history is significant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which has been poorly controlled due to non-compliance with medication and diet. She is also diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and has a 20-year history of smoking  although she quit 5 years ago. In addition  she had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) around ten years ago and suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction three years back.  Currently  she denies any chest pain  dyspnea  or other cardiovascular symptoms. Her recent lower limb pain has been significantly disturbing her sleep and affecting her quality of life  making her visit the emergency department despite her usual avoidance of medical services.  On physical examination  her left foot appeared pale and cool to touch. There is also an ulcerative wound on the medial aspect of her left forefoot. No palpable pulses can be detected in her left lower extremity. Her right leg appears normal  with detectable dorsalis pedis pulses.   The rest of the systems' examination  including CVS  respiratory  Gastrointestinal  and neurology  is unremarkable except for her existing medical conditions.  Her initial diagnostic workup showed elevated blood sugars  lipid profile derangement  and an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) on the lower side for the left leg  suggesting peripheral artery disease.  The severity and duration of her symptoms  along with her physical examination and diagnostic workup  are indicative of critical limb ischemia. The next steps will include the appropriate lifestyle modifications  targeted vascular interventions  optimized medical therapy  and close follow-up for this patient given her high cardiovascular risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,40,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Eduardo Sanchez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the hospital complaining of severe unrelenting pain in his right lower leg that worsens at rest and often disrupts his sleep. He reports this pain has been progressing over the last 6 months. Interestingly  he mentions the pain seems to slightly subside when he dangles his leg off the bed. On visual inspection  the right foot appears pale and the toes show signs of gangrene. Mr. Sanchez also discloses he has been having difficulty with healing a small wound on the forefoot of the same leg.   Mr. Sanchez has a past medical history that includes a 30-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day  though he quit smoking two years ago. His other significant medical history includes uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  hypertension for the past 15 years  dyslipidemia  and a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. He is on regular medications for these conditions which he takes inconsistently. He admits to not following up with his primary care physician regularly.  He denies any history of rheumatologic diseases or recent trauma to the foot. His family history is significant for stroke and coronary artery disease  both in his father.  In summary  Mr. Sanchez’s presentation and past medical history are consistent with critical limb ischemia. His advanced age  long-term smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and history of heart disease significantly increase his risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,41,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Arnold  a 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 30 pack-year smoking history  arrives at the Emergency Department. He complains of severe pain and discomfort in his right leg  that has been progressing for the last six months.   Arnold reports persistent sharp and shooting pain that remains even while resting  and is specifically severe at night. He's been using extra pillows to elevate the limb in an attempt to alleviate his discomfort. He also reports that he has noticed a change in the color of his foot which now appears pale and cold to touch. Recently  he developed an ulcer on his right toe that hasn't been healing. Moreover  he's been having trouble with his mobility mainly due to the pain and noticed his toenails have stopped growing.   He has been non-compliant with his antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications and continues to smoke half a pack of cigarettes daily. His mother had peripheral arterial disease. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.   None of his symptoms have previously been evaluated or treated. The patient works as a truck driver  does not exercise due to his work schedule  and daily pain that now restricts his physical activity. His diet is largely composed of fast food with soda.   This presentation exemplifies Mr. Arnold's risk factors for Critical Limb Ischemia which include his race  age  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking status.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,42,Patient Presentation:  Mr. George McKinnon is a 68-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower leg that has worsened over the past three weeks. The pain intensified to the point where it is present even at rest. Additionally  he has noticed increasing skin discoloration and a cold sensation in the same leg.  He also reports unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds in the last month but denies any change in diet  fever  cough  or night sweats. There is also a non-healing ulcer of 2 cm in diameter on his left heel that appeared a couple of weeks back and is slowly increasing in size.  His past medical history reveals that he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and hypertension 10 years ago for which he takes Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. His diabetic control has been erratic due to inconsistent compliance with medication and diet. He confesses that despite being advised  he has a smoking history of 40 pack-years and still continues to do so.   He lives with his wife in a nearby community and worked as a construction worker until his retirement 5 years ago. He is in moderate distress due to the pain in his left lower leg.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,43,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 74-year-old African American male who presents to the vascular clinic with a chief complaint of severe pain in his right lower leg that has been persisting for four weeks. The pain is excruciating and continuous  even at rest and during the night  and characterized as burning and cramping  primarily in the foot and calf area. Mr. Smith states he has noticed that his foot looks """"a bit bluish"""" and feels cold to touch. He also refers to a non-healing ulcer on his big toe and states that he has lost around 10 lbs in the last month because he is often too uncomfortable to eat.  He has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  hypertension for 15 years  peripheral artery disease diagnosed 3 years ago and chronic kidney disease. Mr. Smith is a former smoker and quit smoking ten years ago after a 40 pack-year history. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine. He admits he doesn't always adhere to his prescribed medication regimen or diet due to his limited income.  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease with both his father and elder brother having had myocardial infarctions in their early 60s.   In summary  it appears that Mr. Smith is presenting with critical limb ischemia which is complicated by his diabetes  hypertension  past history of smoking  and chronic kidney disease."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,44,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Hernandez  a 70-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower extremity that worsens at night. He also reports having painful ulcers on his left foot and calf that won't heal  and his left foot often feels cold to touch. He also experiences numbness in his left toes often.  He has a 30-year history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. He also reports a known diagnosis of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he is supposedly on medications. He is a former smoker  having quit about 10 years ago  but admits to previously smoking about 1 pack per day for more than 35 years.   On examination  his left foot pulses are not palpable while the right foot pulses are diminished. Capillary refill is longer than 3 seconds in the left foot. The lower half of his left foot also showed some discoloration  assumed to be attributable to poor circulation. This examination corroborates the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which has possibly progressed to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Considering the patient's age  medical history  and ethnicity  he fits within the commonly seen demographic for CLI. His uncontrolled diabetes and extensive smoking history further risked him for peripheral artery diseases.   For further evaluation  he'll need Ankle-Brachial Index assessment  followed by imaging studies like Doppler Ultrasound and CT angiography depending on his clinical situation. A multidisciplinary approach will be needed to address his CLI involving vascular surgery  diabetes control  wound care  and lifestyle modifications. His medications will also need to be evaluated in improving blood pressure and lipid control.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,45,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Davis  a 65-year-old African American male  visits the clinic today due neurological symptoms in his lower extremities. He describes a constant pain in his right calf muscle  even while at rest. His prior attempts to alleviate the pain with over-the-counter analgesics have been unfruitful. Additionally  he has noticed that the affected limb turns a bluish hue when he dangles it over the side of his bed and becomes pale when he raises it. He also reports having lost some sensation in his affected leg and has developed a non-healing ulcer on his right heel.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Davis had been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes for 10 years now which resulted in habitual testing of his blood glucose levels  however  this was reportedly not well-controlled. He also has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia and 25-pack year smoking history  having quit smoking just two years ago. A family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) exists  with both his father and elder brother having similar symptoms in their sixties.   Given his uncontrolled diabetic history  presence of a non-healing ulcer  and described limb activity-dependent color change and pain  critical limb ischemia is suspected.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,46,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Rosemary Powell  an African-American woman of 68 years  presents at the emergency department with a chief complaint of worsening pain in her right lower leg that has persisted over the last two weeks. She describes the pain as severe enough to hinder her daily activities. She reports that the pain intensifies even when she’s at rest. She has also noticed a progressive darkening of the skin over her right big toe over the same period.   Ms. Powell's past medical history documents poorly controlled Type-2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the last fifteen years  on metformin  lisinopril  and amlodipine but she has been irregular with her medications and follow-up due to her low socioeconomic situation. She is a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history and a BMI of 35.5 kg/m2  indicating obesity. On further inquiry  she admits she has a history suggestive of intermittent claudication for which she had been neglecting any medical advice. She denies any known history of cardiac disease  stroke  or renal impairment.   The family history is significant for atherosclerosis  with her father having died from a myocardial infarction and her brother having undergone a lower limb amputation secondary to critical limb ischemia.   Owing to her history of poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking along with symptoms of rest pain and skin changes  a provisional diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is considered.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,47,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old African-American male presenting to the outpatient vascular clinic with severe pain in his lower extremities  most pronounced in his right leg. This pain has been progressively worsening over the past few months; it initially occurred intermittently while walking (claudication) but now exists even while at rest  especially at night. He shows visible signs of tissue loss on his right foot  with non-healing ulcers on his toes. Despite optimization of his leg position  his symptoms do not improve. He reports his pain score to be a 9/10 when at rest and mentions he can barely sleep at night.  Past medical history reveals hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both currently optimally controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. He also has a 40-pack-year smoking history and continues to smoke a few cigarettes a day despite numerous attempts to quit. His body mass index is 28  suggestive of overweight. He has no known allergies.   On examination  his right foot is noticeably cooler than the left  with significantly diminished pulses. Nail changes  skin discoloration  and trophic changes are also observed. A quick monofilament test discloses significantly diminished sensation in the right foot compared to the left. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.40 on the right side and 0.85 on the left  indicative of severe peripheral artery disease on the right and moderate disease on the left.  Mr. Smith has a family history of heart disease  stroke  and diabetes mellitus. He lives alone in his home  is retired  and relies on social services. He is unable to walk without resting every few steps due to intense pain and consequently  his mobility is severely compromised. His diet is largely processed and high in sodium due to affordability and accessibility issues.  His complete blood count  lipid profile  renal function tests  and hemoglobin A1C are planned along with a vascular consultation. Patient educations  smoking cessation counseling  and podiatry review is ordered for the management of skin ulcers. The ongoing plan is to assess him for possible revascularization.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,48,Patient Presentation:   Mrs. Maria Ramos  a 72-year-old Hispanic American female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus (for 15 years)  hypertension (for 20 years)  and a 30-pack year smoking history presents to the clinic. She reports experiencing chronic pain in her left lower extremity  specifically in her calf muscle  even at rest  which has progressively worsened over the past two weeks. She states the pain often increases when the leg is elevated and somewhat eases when it is lowered. She also mentions experiencing intermittent cramping in the leg while walking  consistent with claudication described as sharply painful  persisting for several minutes before subsiding.   On physical examination  her left foot is observed to have a slower capillary refill along with non-healing ulcers on the heel. There is noticeable hair loss on the lower leg and the toes appear pale and discolored. Pulses in the foot are diminished  her left ankle-brachial index (ABI) is below 0.40  and she has a vasculitic rash on her calf. She is aware of losing temperature sensation on her foot. Her labs reveal an elevated fasting blood glucose and HbA1c  indicative of poorly controlled diabetes.   Mrs. Ramos resides in an urban area and lives independently in her home. She admits to having poor medication adherence due to financial constraints  which has led to insufficient glycemic and hypertension control. She has quit smoking recently out of concern for her worsening health issues. Maria's father  who had a similar disease history  underwent a lower extremity amputation at the age of 75.   This presentation suggests Mrs. Ramos is experiencing critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries  significantly reducing blood flow to the extremities and initiating severe rest pain  chronic non-healing wounds/ulcers  and/or gangrene. As a long-time smoker and diabetic with poorly controlled hypertension  she falls into the high-risk populace for developing CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,49,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Anna Thompson  a 68-year-old African-American female  presents to the emergency department with worsening lower extremity pain that has been going on for over a month. The pain is primarily located in her left foot and is described as dull and constant  but exacerbated with physical activity. She reports also feeling frequent numbness and intense cramps in her left foot that has been extended up to her calf and is extremely painful  often waking her up at night.   Ms. Thompson reports an extensive history of smoking (30 pack-years) and a 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. In addition  she has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed three years ago. She has noted a non-healing ulcer on her left big toe for the last three weeks  which is an indicator of worsening PAD.   The patient lives alone  is retired  and has limited health literacy. She is wheelchair-bound due to the severity of the pain and the mobility issue it causes. She took non-prescriptive analgesics for the pain which provided mild temporary relief. She has no known drug allergies. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases including her father who died in his 60s following a myocardial infarction.   On physical examinations  she is afebrile. Her blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  and Respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed improved pulses in the right lower extremity as compared to the left. Her left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are non-palpable. There is an ulcer noted on her left big toe  approximately 2 cm in diameter  with some necrotic tissue in the center surrounded by erythematous skin.   She was directed to undergo further necessary diagnostic procedures and treatments for our current presumptive diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. The decision to admit the patient was made considering the severity of her illness and her unstable condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,50,Patient Presentation: A 67-year-old African-American male patient presents to the hospital with complaints of intense  persisting pain in his right lower extremity along with the observable sign of skin discoloration and ulceration on his right foot. The pain is constant and not relieved by rest  often disturbing his sleep at night.  Demographic Details: Patient lives in a rural region of Mississippi and had worked as a truck driver for 35 years before retiring. He is a widower living alone  with two adult daughters residing out of state. He is a high-school graduate and is financially supported by his retirement savings and social security. He is a non-drinker but has been smoking half-a-pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years  for which he takes metformin. The patient also has a history of hypertension and has been on amlodipine for the past 10 years. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for coronary artery disease 3 years ago.  These factors place him at significant risk for peripheral arterial disease leading to critical limb ischemia  considering factors such as his ethnic background  smoking history  chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension  and a history of cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,51,"Patient Presentation:  A 66-year-old Caucasian male carpenter  Mr. A  presents to the clinic with increasing pain in his right lower limb. Mr. A has been suffering from significant rest pain for three weeks now. The pain persists even while he is at rest and escalates at night  preventing him from sleeping properly.   He informs the clinician that he had to resort to hanging his leg over the bedside to find some relief from the constant pain. He also reports having noticed a non-healing wound on his right foot that had developed approximately two months back  which  according to him  """"looks worse"""" now.  Upon physical examination  the patient's right foot is noticed to be pale with delayed capillary refill and a weak pulse. The wound on his foot shows signs of gangrene. He also exhibits intermittent claudication on the affected limb  further indicating peripheral arterial disease.  Mr. A's past medical history reveals he is a smoker for the past 40 years  averaging a pack per day  and has been living with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the last 14 years. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes daily medications for both these conditions  but admits he occasionally forgets to take his diabetes and hypertension pills.  His family history is positive for coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. His father experienced a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and his older brother has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.    Given the presentation  the patient appears to be suffering from critical limb ischemia  likely a consequence of long-standing peripheral arterial disease  hence urgent further diagnosis and treatment initiation is necessary. "
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,52,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  presents today with acute onset severe right foot and calf pain that started three days ago. He indicates that the pain is ongoing  including while at rest. The pain is associated with numbness and a tingling sensation. On examination  the right foot appeared significantly cooler in comparison to the left and a noticeable color change was observed with a notable decrease in the capillary refill time. He also complains of non-healing sores on his right foot for the past two weeks.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant medical history of long-standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is sub-optimally controlled with medication. He also has Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit smoking 4 years ago. He was previously admitted to a hospital five years back for myocardial infarction  following which he underwent coronary artery stenting. He had another hospitalization two years ago due to ischemic stroke with subsequent recovery.   Summary:   Overall  Mr. Rodriguez is a 72-year-old Hispanic male with a history of multiple co-morbidities  including diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a smoking history  coronary artery disease  and previous ischemic stroke  currently presents with signs and symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,53,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Lopez  a 78-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and 40 pack-year smoking  presents to the emergency department with worsening pain in his right lower limb. He states that his right foot has become increasingly painful over the past two weeks  often awaking him from sleep. He has also noticed the skin color of his right foot turning darker than the left  along with decreased hair growth.   On questioning  he reports having experienced intermittent claudication over the past few years  with pain starting to appear in his right calf muscle after walking approximately two city blocks and relieved by rest. However  the pain recently progressed and is now constant  severe  and present even at rest.  Additionally  he also reports a recent unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite  likely due to his constant pain. History reveals no previous diagnosis or treatment related to peripheral artery disease. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or other symptomatic cardio-vascular or respiratory symptoms.   On physical examination  his right leg is cold to touch below the knee  and the foot appears dusky. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable in the affected extremity. There are no active ulcers  but the skin is dry with noticeable hair loss.  This significant history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension predispose Mr. Lopez to peripheral artery disease and further progression to critical limb ischemia  correlating with his current symptomatic presentation. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,54,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 65-year-old Hispanic male who presents with severe pain in his left lower leg that he described as “constant and unbearable.” Upon further inquiry  he noted the pain started a few months ago  initially occurring after walking a short distance but has since become constant. The pain located in his lower leg  foot  and sometimes toes  and rated it as an 8 on a scale of 0-10. He reports that he has difficulty sleeping due to the fact that the pain seems to worsen when the leg is elevated. He also noted skin discoloration on the lower leg and noticed that the foot feels cold to touch. He reports having difficulty with short distance walking and states that at times  he needs to sit and rest to relieve the pain.  In addition to his primary complaint  Mr. Rodriguez has a past medical history of chronic smoking (40-pack years)  poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia and hypertension. A current list of his medications includes Lisinopril  Metformin and Fenofibrate. He has not been previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or other cardiovascular diseases. His family history is significant for his father who had a myocardial infarction at age 72 and a late uncle who had a stroke in his late 60s. Mr. Rodriguez is retired and lives with his wife and their chihuahua. He admits that he has not been compliant with his diabetic diet and medications due to financial constraints.  Upon physical examination  the most notable findings include diminished pulses in the left foot and a lesion at the tip of the big toe that is not healing. Other physical findings include a BMI of 32  blood pressure of 150/90 and his HbA1C was 8.2%. His strength is 5/5 bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities  but he has decreased sensation to light touch distal to the left ankle.  This presentation is characteristic of critical limb ischemia  the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease  and this patient is at high risk given his demographics and medical history. Hence  immediate medical attention and interventions are needed.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thompson is a 70-year-old African-American male patient who presented to the emergency department with severe unrelenting pain in his right lower leg and foot  which worsens at night. The patient complains of a cold sensation in the foot and insensitivity to touch  exacerbating his unsteadiness while walking.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson suffers from poorly controlled Type II Diabetes Mellitus and has a history of hypertension  both been managed with medication for the past fifteen years. He has a 50 pack-year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. Additionally  he suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction approximately five years ago and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery. His lipid profile showed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. He has no known allergies to medications.  Upon physical examination  there was decreased hair growth and noticeable nail thickening in the patient's right lower limb. The limb itself was evidently cooler than the left lower limb  with diminished pulses felt. There was a non-healing foot ulcer located on the right plantar surface  which seemed to have been present for the past two months as per the patient's info.  Mr. Thompson was living independently before the onset of his critical limb ischemia symptoms and had been functioning quite well. The son accompanied him to the appointments  indicating adequate social support.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,56,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Williams  a 72-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency room with a two-week history of progressively worsening pain in his right lower extremity. He describes a severe  unrelenting pain that has been undeterred by over-the-counter pain medications. He has also noticed an increasing sense of coldness and color change  from normal skin tone to a bluish hue on his right foot. Additionally  he mentions a non-healing ulcer on his right heel  and he is unable to feel his foot's normal sensation. His pain intensifies especially at night when he is lying down in his bed  but hanging his leg over the edge seems to provide some relief.  He is a former construction worker and has been retired for the past seven years. Throughout his life  he has been a heavy smoker  exceeding a pack per day  but recently  he quit smoking due to ongoing health concerns.   His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes  which has resulted in peripheral neuropathy  and hypertension. He's also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease and has undergone revascularization procedure (Angioplasty) in his right leg two years ago. He currently takes Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin as an antiplatelet agent.  Despite his medical background  he admits that he struggles to stay adherent to his medication regimen and has a poor diet  often indulging in fast food. Family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases- his mother had a stroke  and his father died due to myocardial infarction. He lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,57,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 74-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history  presents to the emergency department. He complains of severe  constant pain in his right lower extremity at rest that has been worsening over the past few months. He reports the pain significantly worsens when he lies down and is only partially relieved when he hangs his leg off the side of the bed.  He also notes a non-healing ulcer on the right foot that started as a minor cut about two months ago but has progressively expanded despite antibiotic treatment. He denies any history of similar symptoms in the left lower extremity. He has never undergone any vascular procedures.  On physical examination  the right foot is remarkably cooler than the left foot. There is a 3cm x 2cm non-healing  full-thickness ulcer with purulent discharge and necrotic borders located on the medial aspect of his right foot. On further examination  distal pulses in the right lower extremity including the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are non-palpable. There are no similar findings in the left lower extremity.  Given the above presentation and his significant risk factors including age  male gender  African American race  uncontrolled diabetes  smoking history and peripheral vascular disease  the working diagnosis is critical limb ischemia.  Further diagnostic tests are planned and necessary  including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) testing and angiography for further evaluation of the extent of disease. He is also evaluated by the vascular surgery team for possible revascularization options  and by wound care for management of his non-healing wound. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,58,Patient Presentation:  A 70-year-old African American male patient  Mr. J  presents to the emergency department complaining of a 2-week history of severe rest pain in his left lower limb  particularly at night. The pain is characterized by a burning and cramping sensation in the calf  foot  and toes  which he describes as a '10' on a scale of '10'  which disturbs his sleep and is unrelieved by over-the-counter pain medications. There is also a history of non-healing sores on the same foot  which appeared about 3 weeks prior.  He also reports coldness of the limb  pallor  loss of hair on the limb  and noticeable weight loss. He denies any trauma or injury to the affected limb.  Mr. J has a significant past medical history that includes uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack year history of smoking. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement 8 years back due to coronary artery disease. The patient's family history is remarkable for coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  On physical examination  the left foot reveals pallor  coolness to touch  presence of ulcers on the toes  and weak-to-absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) shows a value of less than 0.4 on the left side.  Overall  his presentation is consistent with critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the setting of advanced PAD.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,59,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Joan Miller is a 78-year-old African American female who presents alone to the office today complaining of severe pain in her lower legs. She reports that the pain persists even at rest and occasionally wakes her up at night. Over the past several weeks  she has noticed that her right foot often feels cold  and her toes have turned a slight blue color. She has non-healing sores on both feet  worse on the right foot. She also notes a progressive difficulty in walking short distances due to both pain and weakness  particularly in her right leg.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Miller is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with oral antidiabetic drugs for the past 15 years. She also suffers from hypertension and has been on antihypertensives for ten years. There is a history of coronary artery disease diagnosed eight years ago  with percutaneous coronary intervention done but she is not currently on any anticoagulants. She is a former smoker and quit 15 years ago. There is no known drug allergy. Her family history indicates a strong genetic predisposition towards cardiovascular disease.   Demographics: Mrs. Miller is widowed with three children  two daughters and one son  all living independently. She lives alone in a single-story house but has some hired help for chores. She worked as an elementary school teacher and retired ten years ago. She is under Medicare. She has a history of limited physical activity and a diet high in fats and low in fiber.  This history and symptoms suggest the possibility of Critical Limb Ischemia  possibly linked to her history of diabetes  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease. Further evaluation will be required to confirm this suspicion. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Miles is a 72-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with a history of discoloration and coldness of the right foot ongoing for 3 weeks  which has recently been accompanied by rest pain and non-healing ulcers over the extremity. He has also noticed decreased strength and sensation in the foot. His past medical history is significant for gr1 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 45-pack-year smoking history. He is currently on metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. He lives with his wife and is retired.   On physical examination  his foot is found to be cold  pale  and mottled with diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. A capillary refill test shows results greater than 3 seconds. There are several small  non-healing  painful ulcers on the tips of his toes.  This history and presentation are typical of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a serious condition causing severe discomfort due to peripheral artery disease. His risk factors include advanced age  race  smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He needs immediate attention to avoid potential limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,61,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Harvey  a 74-year-old African American male  comes into the emergency department accompanied by his daughter. He presents with severe rest pain in his right leg that has been progressively worsening over the past six weeks. He reports that the pain began in his foot and has now progressed up to his calf  and is present even when at rest  rating it as a 8 out of 10. The pain is severe enough to disrupt his sleep. Upon examination  there's noticeable pallor and coldness to touch in the affected limb. On inspection  there's a poorly healing ulcer on his right great toe.  Mr. Harvey has a past medical history significant for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that is relatively well-controlled with Metformin  and he has peripheral artery disease. He also has a history of a 20-pack-year smoking habit  but he quit 10 years ago. He is not on any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. He has no known drug allergies.  He lives with his daughter who is his primary caregiver  and reports that he is occasionally non-adherent to his prescribed treatments due to forgetfulness. His family history reveals that his father died of myocardial infarction  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 73.  This presentation suggests the patient may have critical limb ischemia  a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease  likely secondary to his longstanding diabetes and history of smoking. The severe rest pain and the presence of a poorly healing wound in the affected limb highlight the urgency of his condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thomas Jones is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of severe right lower extremity pain. The patient reports that the pain has been steadily worsening over the past three months  with it becoming unmanageable and continuous over the past week. The pain is described as a burning and aching sensation which intensifies upon elevation of the leg.   Accompanying the pain are noticeable color changes to the right foot with areas of bluish discoloration  especially on the toes. He has also noticed a decrease in the temperature of the right foot compared to the left. Rest pain has been so intense that it prevents Mr. Jones from sleeping. Further information reveals the presence of non-healing ulcers on his right foot.  Mr. Jones has a known past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last 15 years  Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)  and chronic smoking (40 pack years). He has been on insulin therapy and oral anti-diabetic medications to control his blood glucose levels. However  he has been facing difficulty managing his diabetes due to an unstable financial condition. His PAD has been managed with conservative treatments  including diet  exercise  and medications.   The patient lives alone  and due to his limited mobility  he has improper nutritional intake and is significantly underweight.  His PAD  combined with a long history of smoking and poorly controlled diabetes  has likely contributed to the critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,63,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Hernandez is a 73-year-old Hispanic female who has been referred by her primary care physician to the vascular outpatient clinic with the chief complaint of constant  non-healing wounds on her right foot for the past three months. The pain in her foot often worsens at night and slightly improves upon walking.  She reports that her rest pain is interfering severely with her sleep and she's lost 10 pounds in the past four months due to reduced appetite  which she attributes to her overall discomfort. Upon physical examination  her right foot appears pale  and skin temp is cool to touch. Pulses in her right foot are absent on palpation.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2  both diagnosed 15 years ago and they have been poorly controlled due to non-compliance with medications. She admits to a 20-year history of two packs of cigarettes per day  though she quit smoking 5 years ago. She has no known allergies.  She lives alone  her children live out of city and visit her occasionally. She retired as a school teacher five years ago. She has no history of surgical operations  no recorded allergies  and she adheres to a traditional Hispanic diet.  The current working diagnosis is critical limb ischemia  particularly considering her diabetes  hypertension  former smoking  and physical presentation. She'll be scheduled for noninvasive vascular studies for further investigations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the hospital today with resting lower limb pain for the past three weeks. It has been severe and persistent  worsening in severity over the last couple of days  particularly during the night. Accompanying the pain  he reports non-healing ulcers on his right foot and a noticeable decrease in mobility  attributing it to the excruciating pain. Patient works as a retired school teacher  smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years  and has a BMI of 32.   Relevant past medical history reveals that Mr. James is hypertensive  diagnosed ten years back  and has type II diabetes managed with Metformin. The patient had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  with a stent placement. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) a year ago.   Family history includes a father who had a myocardial infarction in his 60s and a brother with PAD. Given the severity of his symptoms and past medical history of PAD  myocardial infarction  diabetes  and hypertension  the patient is suspected of critical limb ischemia and is further evaluated for the same.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,65,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Brown is a 70-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right foot. He describes the pain as """"constant""""  and """"burning""""/""""cold""""  rating it as an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale even at rest. Over the course of the last two weeks  he noticed that his foot had begun to change color – it is now pale with some areas appearing bluish.  His past medical history is significant. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for over 15 years now  and has a 45-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day. He also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medications. A year ago  he experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (heart attack).   His family history reveals that his father suffered from peripheral vascular diseases and also had an amputation.  On exam  his right foot is cold to touch  with notable absence of posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. Upon examination  his foot shows significant signs of tissue loss including gangrenous toes.  He lives alone  is a retired mechanic  and his activities of daily living have been increasingly hindered due to the progression of his symptoms. He is in obvious distress due to the current pain level. His last Hemoglobin A1C level was 8.0%  indicating suboptimal control of his diabetes. He has been compliant with medications but has never engaged in smoking cessation strategies.  This clinical picture is highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He must undergo further investigations (such as angiography) to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity  after which treatment options need to be discussed including lifestyle changes  medications optimization  revascularization procedures and  in severe cases  possibly amputation."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,66,Patient Presentation:  Mr. R is a 68-year-old African-American male who was brought to the Emergency Department. Complains of persistent and severe pain in his right lower leg at rest  the duration of which has been about two weeks. He reports that the pain is worse at night and interrupts his sleep  rating it an 8 out of 10. States that keeping the leg down provides some relief. The right leg appears notably bluish in color with non-healing sores on two toes. He admits being unable to walk distances that he normally could due to muscle weakness and fatigue.   Past Medical History:  The Patient has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes for 10 years poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents  a 50-pack year history of heavy smoking but quit five years ago. He also has had high cholesterol and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed three years ago. He has been under medication to control these conditions but has been inconsistent in compliance and management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,67,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 72-year-old Caucasian man  a retired factory worker  who presents to the emergency department with severe ongoing pain in his left lower limb  particularly in his calf and foot  over the past couple of weeks. The pain has worsened in the last 24 hours  interrupting his sleep and causing significant distress. He reports the pain as atypical rest pain  rating it as an 8 out of 10  and states it increases when his leg is elevated.   Upon physical examination  his left foot was noticeably cooler than his right foot. Noticeable skin discoloration and non-healing ulcerations were found on his left calf and foot. The peripheral pulse on his left leg was weak compared to his right side. His left foot also shows signs of necrosis  raising suspicion of critical limb ischemia.  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history as a long-term (over 30 years) smoker  has Stage II Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) diagnosed 3 years ago. He also has a history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago which has been poorly controlled  and more recently  he suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction 2 years ago.   He lives alone since his wife passed away 5 years ago  his two adult children stay nearby but he barely asks them for any help. His diet is not very well balanced and he is non-compliant with his medications due to forgetfulness as he ages  these factors amplify the potential risk factors for worsening his ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,68,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 72-year-old African American male who presents to the vascular clinic with a chief complaint of progressive severe pain in his left lower extremity that has been ongoing for the past 3 months and is now affecting his ability to sleep at night. The pain is characterized as a severe  burning sensation in his foot that exacerbates with elevation and partially relieves when he hangs his foot off the edge of the bed. He also mentions an ulcer on the ball of his left foot which he noticed 2 weeks ago  and has not been healing despite regular cleansing and dressing. He denies any acute chest pain or dyspnea.  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 12 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia which have been managed with medication therapy and dietary modifications. He quit smoking almost 5 years ago but had a 35-pack-year smoking history prior to that. The patient also admits to continuous alcohol consumption  approximately a single minimum serving daily  throughout his adulthood.   Records confirm the last ankle-brachial index (ABI) done about 17 months ago was 0.75. He is adhering to his antihypertensive  lipid-lowering  and antidiabetic medications.  This patient presentation accurately follows with representative literature with the average age of presentation and prevalence being higher in African American race  and common risk factors being diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,69,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Michael Thompson is a 71-year-old African-American male  a retired dockworker from Baltimore  Maryland. He presents to the outpatient vascular clinic with worsening right lower extremity pain. The pain has been ongoing for several months but has significantly worsened in the past week  and it's particularly prominent at night  disturbing his sleep. The pain is located in his right calf and foot  and it improves when he dangles his foot over the side of the bed. He also reports having a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. He adds that he had unexplained weight loss and fatigue in the past few months.  In his past medical history  Mr. Thompson has been a type II diabetic for the past 15 years  and hypertension for the past 10 years. His medication includes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. He admits to having smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for over 50 years  but he quit five years ago. His family history is remarkable for cardiovascular disease; his father died of a stroke at age 80  and his elder brother underwent a coronary angioplasty at the age of 72.  On examination  his right foot is pale compared to the left  cold to touch  and we could not palpate the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses.  Considering his history and clinical presentation  Mr. Thompson is likely to be suffering from critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,70,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African-American male patient  Mr. R  presents to a vascular care clinic complaining of recurring severe pain in his right lower leg for the past 3-4 weeks  especially with any attempt to walk. Furthermore  at rest  he often feels a dull  constant ache in the leg. He reports intermittent tingling  coldness  and feelings of pins and needles  and shows noticeable signs of leg pallor and atrophic skin changes. He notes that he has been having difficulty walking due to pain and feeling of 'heaviness' in his leg.  His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a smoking history of 20 pack years. He also confirms a history of coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. He has not had any previous lower limb surgical interventions. On examination  his right foot is notably colder than the left one  and his right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable.   The patient's ongoing symptoms suggest severe peripheral arterial disease and are consistent with critical limb ischemia. Mr. R's advanced age  male gender  African-American ethnicity  active smoking habit  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of heart disease are all risk factors that contribute to this condition according to existing medical literature. His complaints of persistent ache  worsening lower limb dysfunction  and relevant clinical signs indicate an urgent need for further vascular assessment and management to avoid potential limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,71,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department with severe  unrelenting pain in his left lower leg and foot over the past two days. The pain is persistent even when the leg is at rest. He notes his left foot has a bluish tinge and feels cold to touch. Mr. Johnson also reports increasing difficulty in walking over the past month due to the painful aching in his calf muscles.   Past medical history is significant for long-standing type 2 diabetes  which he admits to poor glycemic control. He has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 3 years ago and was advised lifestyle modification and medical therapy which he has been non-compliant. Additionally  he has treated hypertension and is a heavy smoker for the past 50 years. There is no known history of cardiac disease.  The combination of his risk factors including age  race  poorly managed diabetes  hypertension  and chronic smoking  combined with his long standing peripheral artery disease contributes to a prime demographic picture for critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,72,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Martinez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents in the emergency department with severe resting pain in his right lower leg that has persisted for several weeks. The pain is 8/10 in intensity  with only marginal relief by over-the-counter analgesics. It increases with activity but is also present at rest  often disturbing his sleep. He reports a sensation of “numb and cold” in the affected limb.  On closer questioning  he admits losing approximately 10 pounds over the last month due to decreased appetite  particularly secondary to the pain. He also describes a small  non-healing wound located on his right foot  revealing intermittent claudication.   His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes for 8 years  poorly controlled hypertension  and a 50-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking a year ago on his doctor's advice. Additionally  there’s a record of heart disease in his family  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.   Mr. Martinez used to be fairly active  managing a small convenience store within his neighborhood. However  the nature and intensity of the leg pain has drastically limited his mobility and subsequently his daily activities.   His BMI is within the normal range  but leg examination reveals decreased hair growth on his lower limbs and foot  with shiny  discolored skin. His foot is cold to touch and the peripheral pulses are not palpable in his right leg. There's also a small  poorly healing wound on the first metatarsal with localized erythema. He also indicates that the right foot and ankle are usually more edematous than the left one.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,73,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Carlos Ramírez  a 68-year-old Latino male  presents to the emergency department with severe rest pain in his right lower extremity  worsening over the past six weeks. It is severe enough to wake him from sleep and is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications. He also reports ulcerations on his right foot that have not healed over the past three weeks. On examination  his right foot appears pale and cool to touch  with two non-healing ulcers about 1 cm in diameter on the lateral aspect of the foot.  Mr. Ramírez has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes metformin and a statin medication. He is a former smoker with 40 pack-years of smoking but quit ten years ago. He also has a prior history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years back.   Furthermore  he mentions a family history of peripheral arterial disease; both his father and older brother had significant limb pain and related complications. His father underwent a lower limb amputation due to uncontrolled disease.   He admits having had difficulty walking due to pain in his legs for about a year but did not seek medical attention  attributing the pain to aging and his sedentary lifestyle. Recently  the pain has intensified significantly  now making it nearly impossible to walk more than a few steps. He reports no chest pain  breathlessness  or acute changes in vision or speech.   Mr. Ramírez lives alone and is retired. He admits to consuming alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,74,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J.S.  a 70-year-old African American male with a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease  presents with complaints of severe rest pain in his left leg that has been intensifying over the last week. The pain is worse at night and often wakes him from sleep. He notes a persistent  non-healing ulcer on his left heel for the past three weeks.   He has been a smoker for the past 30 years  with a 40-pack-year history and has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled by a medication regimen including metformin  amlodipine  and simvastatin. He underwent cardiac catheterization 2 years ago due to chronic stable angina  which resulted in stenting of left anterior descending artery.   On physical examination  the patient's left leg appears pallor with slowly capillary refill time (>3 sec)  and the dorsalis pedis and post-tibial pulses are not palpable on the left side. The ulcer on his left heel is approximately 2.0 cm in diameter  with a pale base and poorly defined edges.  Given this presentation  a clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is established. The patient’s long history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  and peripheral artery disease increase his risk for developing CLI.   To confirm the diagnosis  further diagnostic testing  including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Duplex ultrasound  CT angiography or MR angiography  would be recommended. Consequently  a prompt vascular surgery consultation would also be advised for potential revascularization procedures  to restore the blood supply and save the limb. Meanwhile  adequate pain control  wound care  optimizing blood glucose levels  hypertension  and lipid management  and cessation of tobacco use would be addressed comprehensively in the management of this patient.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,75,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Alexander  a 67-year-old African-American male with a 20-year history of poorly controlled type-II diabetes  presents in the emergency department today. He is a seasoned veteran and retired as a sergeant after rendering service at the U.S. Army for 30 years. He has a history of hypertension  endorsing smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for over 35 years  but quit around three years ago on the advice of his primary care physician. The patient states he began to notice severe pain in the left foot upon exertion since the last couple of months; however  the severity and frequency increased over the past weeks.  The patient further reported the development of non-healing ulcers on the toes of his left foot over a month ago  which has progressively worsened. His pain has become persistent and severe  often waking him up from sleep. He also noted a noticeable temperature difference between his feet  with the left foot being cooler. He has not had any fever  chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness.   Mr. Alexander's past surgical history is significant for appendectomy 30 years ago. He is on metformin and lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension  respectively. He reports no known drug allergies.  Especially concerning here is the potential for critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease  given his chronic history of diabetes  hypertension  and former smoking habit. Prompt evaluation including an ankle-brachial index  pulse examination  and angiography may be warranted.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,76,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African-American male with a known past medical history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years and a 40-pack year smoking history  who presents to the Emergency Department with severe pain in his right leg that has been progressively worsening over the past 4 weeks. The pain is continuous and increases on walking even for short distances  often not subsiding during rest or sleep. He also complains about the presence of chronic non-healing ulcers on his foot.   His relevant surgical history includes a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 5 years back. Notably  patient has a known history of peripheral artery disease and refused recommended intervention 2 years ago. He denies experiencing chest pain  palpitations  dyspnea  or syncope.  He lives with his wife and managed with only limited assistance in activities of daily living prior to the onset of current symptoms. He reports poor adherence to prescribed antidiabetic medications at home and continued tobacco use.   He also has a history of non-compliance to medical advice and treatment and has had minimal follow-up with his primary care physician in the past due to financial constraints  since he's dependent on his social security benefits and limited insurance coverage. His eldest son is a practicing GP in another state  and is considering moving his father in with his family for bette healthcare logistical support.   His vitals on presentation are stable. Physical examination reveals an absent right pedal pulse  significantly faded dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses  pallor on elevation of the foot  and non-healing ulcers on the foot. Preliminary assessment points towards critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,77,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department complaining of chronic severe pain in his lower extremity  particularly his left leg  which significantly intensifies at night. He reports intermittent claudication while walking  rest pain  and non-healing ulcers on his toes. He is a former smoker  with a 40 pack-year smoking history  and has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for 16 years which has been poorly controlled. His other medical history includes hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He is unable to walk or maintain his daily activities due to the severity of the pain. On examination  there is a noticeable absence of the left pedal pulse  and the skin of the leg is cold to the touch  with visible gangrene on two of his left toes. There are also signs of atrophy in the calf muscles. The patient rates his pain as 10/10.  This patient presentation is typical for critical limb ischemia (CLI)  which is the most severe form of peripheral artery disease. The most significant risk factors for CLI include being over age 70  being a current or former smoker  diabetes mellitus  and a history of cardiovascular disease like our patient. CLI is more prevalent among males and Hispanic populations  making Mr. Rodriguez's presentation consistent with epidemiological trends. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,78,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Juan Lopez  a 68-year-old retired Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department for increased pain in his left lower leg that has been worsening over the past three weeks. The pain is sharp and severe  rating it 8/10 on the pain scale; the pain worsens with activity  but rarely completely disappears even at rest. He has noticed skin changes; a non-healing ulcer located on his left heel and skin discoloration around the left knee. Mr. Lopez also reports feeling his left foot is """"cold"""". He denies any paresthesia  heavy smoking  or any significant weight loss.  Relevant Past Medical History: He has been diagnosed with uncontrolled type-II diabetes and hypertension for the past 10 years  and peripheral artery disease (PAD) which was diagnosed five years ago. In the last six months  his physical activity has lessened due to pains in his lower legs.   Previous investigations: He had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) done three years ago  resulting in 0.70. His most recent HbA1c level was 9.7%.  Lifestyle: Mr. Lopez admits that he has been a smoker for 40 years and manages to quit occasionally  but usually goes back to his smoking habit during periods of stress. He may consume alcohol occasionally over the weekends. Mr. Lopez lives with his wife. He is economically secure  but accessibility to healthier food options is challenging as there are very few supermarkets within walking distance of his home  predominantly fast food restaurants.   Related family history: His mother passed away from a stroke and his brother has been recently diagnosed with heart disease."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,79,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jose Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male presented at the emergency department. He reports increasing pain in his left leg  especially when he can't move much due to work  which he initially shrugged off as a result of aging and his history of moderate physical labor. He also mentions that the pain significantly enhances at night  sometimes waking him from sleep and has noticed a pale discoloration of his left foot. His wife noticed a non-healing wound about the size of a quarter on his left ankle which prompted them to seek medical help.  Mr. Rodriguez has a known history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  dyslipidemia  and hypertension. He quit smoking eight years ago after a 30-year pack history. His medication list includes metformin  lisinopril  and simvastatin. He does not report any known allergies.  Upon physical examination  diminished pulses were palpable in the left lower extremity  particularly in the distal dorsal pedis and posterior tibial arteries. The left foot appeared pallor with a small ulcer on the left ankle with no signs of acute infection.   Mr. Rodriguez's symptoms of rest pain  changes in skin color  presence of a non-healing ulcer  and diminished pulses in the left lower extremity raise a high suspicion for critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,80,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Roberto Garcia is a 67-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the clinic with a three-week history of severe rest pain in his left lower extremity  especially at night. He also reports a non-healing ulcer on his left big toe that has been present for over two months  despite the use of antibiotics and local wound care.   He has been suffering from significant pain making it even difficult to sleep or rest without Ibuprofen  a medication he is also finding less effective lately. He walks with a limp favoring his left leg  which he says has been progressively getting worse to the point where he cannot manage to walk more than half a block without having to stop due to pain.  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he is on metformin and insulin. He also has a 24-year history of hypertension  currently managed with lisinopril  and a 46 pack-year history of smoking  although he quit five years ago. There is also a documented history of high cholesterol  and he is currently on atorvastatin for the condition.  Mr. Garcia's family history indicates a trend of cardiovascular disease among his siblings and parents  with his father suffering a fatal myocardial infarction in his late 50s. Remarkable history includes a stroke three years ago  with minor residual left-sided weakness.  Apart from the analgesics for managing pain  he expresses difficulties in adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications towards managing Diabetes and hypertension due to low health literacy and financial constraints. He also admits to occasional alcohol intake. On physical exam  the left foot is cold to touch and has a weak or absent pedal pulse. The ulcer has a dark  necrotic base and is surrounded by erythema.   This patient’s presentation and history are consistent with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His long-term uncontrolled diabetes and smoking history are significant risk factors. The non-healing wound  limb pain at rest and absent peripheral pulses are important clinical signs of the advanced peripheral artery disease symbolizing a necessity for an urgent intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,81,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Shaw is a 72-year-old African American woman with a 40-year history of smoking  poorly controlled type II diabetes  and hypertension. She is a retired school teacher from Chicago  Illinois  and lives with her elder sister. She presents with critical limb ischemia characterized by severe and constant pain in her right leg that has lasted for the past two months. The pain is more intense at night and often interrupts her sleep. She reports that previously  she would experience pain on her leg while walking  but it would subside once she rested. Recently  the pain has become unrelenting.   She also states that she noticed a non-healing wound on her right toe  which she first observed three weeks ago. She additionally mentions that her right leg feels cold compared to the left one and she has noticed decreased hair growth on this leg. Over the course of the last month  she has lost 8 pounds unintentionally  attributing it to loss of appetite.  Past Medical History (PMH):   Ms. Shaw was diagnosed with type II diabetes 20 years ago  but her blood sugar levels have remained inconsistently controlled despite medication. Hypertension was diagnosed 15 years ago  which is on medication but not regularly monitored. She has a history of smoking one pack daily for the past 40 years but denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. No known drug allergies. She underwent an appendectomy in her twenties but her surgical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her family history is significant for peripheral artery disease in her mother. She is currently on metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and a daily aspirin for cardiovascular prevention. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,82,Patient Presentation:  John Dawson  a 68-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department accompanied by his wife. He lives in a rural area in the southern United States with limited access to healthcare facilities. He is a retired construction worker and has a 45-pack year history of smoking  although he stopped smoking 3 years ago.  Chief Complaint:   John complains of severe pain in his right lower leg  which has become constant over the past five days. The pain intensifies when the leg is elevated  and partially releases when he hangs the leg off the bed. He reports feeling some numbness and coldness in the foot as well.  Past Medical History:  John has a significant past medical history for Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both poorly controlled. He has been on oral hypoglycemics and antihypertensives for over 20 years  but admits to inconsistent medication adherence. He has also been taking simvastatin for hyperlipidemia.   Family History:  There is family history of cardiovascular diseases in his parents  and his brother suffered from a heart attack at the age of 55.   Physical Examination:  John appears in distress  his BMI is 32 and there is reduced hair growth on his lower right leg. His right foot is cold to touch with diminished pulses  and there are early signs of gangrene on the great toe.   Assessment:  Considering John's history of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use  along with his clinical presentation  he is provisionally diagnosed with critical limb ischemia of the right leg. A vascular specialist was called in for confirmation and immediate management. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,83,A 68-year-old African American male presents with a four-week history of continuous pain in his right lower extremity  predominantly at the foot level. The pain intensifies at night and he often needs to dangle the foot over the bedside to alleviate discomfort. He has noticed a gradual change in the skin coloration of his foot to a darker shade  and dreads touching it since it feels cold as ice. There's also an open wound on his great toe that is healing poorly.  His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which he is on oral medication. He's adherent to his medications  but confesses that his dietary habits and blood sugar control have been erratic. He was a former 20-year pack smoker but quit ten years ago.  He has no known allergies. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  with his father having passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 72 and his older brother undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure two years ago.  On physical examination  his right foot is found to be cool to touch with diminished pedal pulses. Ulceration and gangrene are noted on his great toe. Importantly  the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the right leg was 0.7  confirming significant peripheral arterial disease. On his left foot  pedal pulses are palpable  skin coloration and temperature are normal and ABI is above 0.9. His BMI is 28.2. His blood pressure shows consistent readings around 145/90 mmHg  and lab results indicate uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c: 8.3). He's diagnosed with critical limb ischemia of the right foot and a comprehensive management plan is shared with him  understanding the high risk of amputation in his condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,84,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Carter  is a 70-year-old African American male  hailing from the urban areas of Washington  D.C. He comes presenting with chronic extreme  recurrent pain in the right lower extremity at rest. He mentions the pain is more prominent at night. The pain is so severe that it interrupts his sleep and he has to hang his leg over the edge of the bed to alleviate it. He additionally reported intermittent claudication over the past year. Further  he also complains about non-healing ulcers on his right foot. There is an absence of pulse in the right foot.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Carter is a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus  on medication  for the past 15 years. The patient also suffers from hypertension for the last 10 years. He is on antihypertensive medication to control that as well. His records show that he is a former smoker who quit ten years ago but had a history of heavy smoking prior to cessation. He also has a history of occasional alcohol use. In light of his older age  multi-morbidity  smoking history  and racial demographic  he represents an accurate demographic for a higher risk of critical limb ischemia as per the literature.   Family History:  Mr. Carter’s father had a history of peripheral arterial disease and had undergone a leg amputation procedure  and his mother died from a stroke at an older age  indicative of underlying cardiovascular conditions within his family.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,85,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Sanchez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  long-standing tobacco use (35 pack-years)  and peripheral artery disease  presented to the emergency department with complaints of excruciating pain in his right leg  below the knee which he rates as 10/10. The pain has been present for the last four weeks and increased significantly over the last two days. He also reports non-healing sores on the leg's skin and color changes with noticeable pallor and mottling. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath or dizziness and does not have any known allergies.   He leads a sedentary lifestyle  rarely indulges in physical activities  is a letter carrier and lives with his wife and three children. He has a 50-year history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has not yet quit. He's been under treatment for diabetes for the last ten years and takes Metformin 500mg twice daily along with aspirin he has been consuming for his diagnosed peripheral artery disease. He reports poor adherence to medications  forgetting to take his diabetic medications almost half of the month.  Upon evaluation  extensive necrotic changes were found from his mid-calf to the foot  particularly over the heel and lateral foot with exposed tendons. His peripheral pulses were diminished in the right foot with a reduced capillary refill time of 4 seconds. The pain has forced Mr. Sanchez to take rest which is eventually leading to a decrease in his quality of life.   This scenario represents critical limb ischemia which is prevalent in old age male population with poor lifestyle habits including smoking and non-compliance to medications. It is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease and is commonly seen in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. These types of patients often receive delayed care due to a lack of understanding of the severity of their symptoms.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,86,Patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history (PMH) significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 40-year history of smoking. Moreover  he has hyperlipidemia and known peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient came in today reporting a 6-month history of both rest pain and ischemic ulcers on the third and fifth toes of his right foot.   He states that the pain is sharp  always present  persistent even at rest  and most pronounced in his foot. As for the ulcers  they are full-thickness and measure approximately 2 cm and 1 cm in diameter  respectively  with eschar on the wound beds. He admits to decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss due to the pain  as he's unable to walk to the kitchen and prepare his meals. Additionally  sleep has been affected because his foot pain worsens when he lies flat on his bed.   The patient had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of less than 0.40 a year ago at his cardiologist's office. He has never had any revascularization procedures in the past  but has been on aspirin and a statin for his PAD. Also  he reveals that regarding lower extremity bypass surgery and potential complications  the conversation has been initiated  however he is undecided so far.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,87,Patient Presentation: Mr. Abdul  a 76-year-old African American male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and an active smoker  presenting today with increasing pain in his right lower extremity. He reports having the pain at rest over the past few days  along with numbness and occasional tingling. He also noticed a new onset of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot that has persisted for the past two weeks. On examination  his right foot has a dusky appearance and is cold to touch with decreased capillary refill. Pulses are palpable but weak distally. Mr. Abdul reports that he recently experienced weight loss as well.  Summary: This is a 76-year-old African American male  known diabetic  hypertensive  and smoker  presenting with critical limb ischemia characterized by rest pain  non-healing ulcer  and clinical signs suggesting arterial insufficiency on the right lower limb.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,88,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Hernandez is a 72-year-old Hispanic female presenting today with a complaint of severe leg pain in her right lower limb. She reports that the pain has been persistent for the past two months but has progressively worsened over the past week. The pain is not isolated to when she's moving; she also experiences pain at rest  particularly at night. She describes the pain as a constant  sharp  and burning sensation  rating it as an 8 on the pain scale.  She has difficulty walking due to the pain  which she describes as a """"cramp"""" that subsides when she stops walking. Ms. Hernandez also reports intermittent numbness in her right foot and has noticed that her right foot appears pale in comparison to her left foot.

Ms. Hernandez also has a history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Atorvastatin. The patient is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but smoked a pack a day for approximately 30 years prior to quitting.  She had no surgical history and her vaccines are up-to-date. Family history is significant for heart disease and stroke in her father. Ms. Hernandez lives with her daughter  her primary caregiver  since the passing of her spouse 5 years ago. She reports having no allergies. She expresses worry about her condition and hopes to understand what could be causing her symptoms. "
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,89,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Lorenzo Vargas  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  arrives at the clinic with a chief complaint of severe rest pain in his right lower leg. The pain has become unbearable  disrupting his sleep and daily activities  and has gradually worsened over the past 4 weeks. He also notes a non-healing ulcer on his right shin that developed two weeks ago. On probing further  the patient admits to experiencing intermittent claudication in the right leg for the last six months.   Mr. Vargas has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the last 10 years  hypertension for 15 years  and he quit smoking 5 years ago after a 35-year pack history. He also has a history of myocardial infarction three years ago. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose aspirin.   On physical examination  his right leg is noticeably colder than his left  with paleness and dry skin. He has a weak distal pulse in the right foot  and the ulcer on the right shin is about 2 cm in diameter  shallow  with a necrotic base. Mr. Vargas’s BMI is 31  suggestive of obesity which increases his cardiovascular risks. His blood pressure is managed  averaging at 138/85 mmHg.   Mr. Vargas’s presentation and past medical history suggest the possibility of critical limb ischemia with likely peripheral artery disease  primarily due to his diabetes  hypertension  smoking history  and documented history of cardiovascular disease.  
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,90,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old African-American male presents to the vascular clinic with a chief complaint of severe  escalating pain in his left lower leg at rest. The pain typically becomes heightened at night while sleeping and is most often relieved by positioning the leg in a dependent position. He also reports sores on his left leg that are slow to heal  and notes the continued pallor of the foot when elevated along with a dusky red discoloration with dependency. His discomfort has made it impossible for him to continue his job as a security guard regarding night shifts.  He suffers from a history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus  peripheral arterial disease  and has been a smoker for around 45 years  approximately a pack a day  although he managed to cut back to five cigarettes a day about a year ago. His diabetes has been treated with metformin and a controlled diet  however his adherence to medication and the diet plan has been inconsistent. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively.  Additionally  his mother had a history of peripheral arterial disease  suggesting a possible hereditary predisposition. His long-standing smoking habit  alongside uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  are contributory to his current clinical condition.  Thus  the patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia  based on his diabetes  smoking history  ethnic background  age  and the symptoms of ischemic rest pain and non-healing sores on his foot. The rest pain and tissue loss have escalated over past few weeks  reflecting the chronicity  and rapidly progressing seriousness of this condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,91,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic male presenting with a complaint of severe resting pain in his right leg  which has been progressively worsening over the past two months. The pain is unrelenting and becomes especially intense during nighttime. He also noticed that the toes on his right foot have turned a bluish-black color  and there is an unhealed sore on the big toe that has been present for over two weeks.  His past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which has been rather poorly controlled  and a 40 pack-year history of smoking. He also reports longstanding hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His regular medications include metformin  atorvastatin  and antihypertensive agents.  The patient resides in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood with minimal access to fresh and nutritious foods. He does not engage in any regular physical activity and has a family history of peripheral artery disease and stroke. As per the patient  he is losing sleep due to the pain and increasingly worried about the color change in his toes  which prompted him to seek medical care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,92,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Juan Hernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presents to the clinic. Over the past 6 months  Mr. Hernandez has been treated for poorly controlled diabetes with persistent hyperglycemia. In addition  he has a 45-year history of smoking  although he quit 2 years ago.   Over the last week  he's noticed pain in his left foot  which becomes severe when walking and improves with rest. In recent days  he's started experiencing pain even when he's at rest  primarily at night. Mr. Hernandez also says that his foot constantly feels cold  and he's noticed the skin on his foot turning a darker color. He shares his concern about a wound on his toe that hasn't healed for almost a month.  He has experienced no changes in his vision  no episodes of chest pain  does not have any difficulty in swallowing and no noticeable change in his weight. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases.  Upon physical examination  his left lower extremity was noted to be cool to touch with decreased hair growth. His toe is observed to have significant tissue loss and appears to be necrotic. His pedal pulses are diminished and capillary refill is slow.  This presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI) with the presence of rest pain  non-healing wound  and physical findings associated with poor peripheral circulation. The risk factors are consistent with his CLI diagnosis i.e.  elderly male  Hispanic ethnicity  long-term tobacco use  presence of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,93,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic reporting a 3-month history of progressive pain in his right lower extremity. The pain is characterized as aching  with burning sensations  felt mostly at rest and worsening at night. The pain severity sometimes interrupts his sleep. It is associated with non-healing ulcers on his right foot and noticeable temperature differences in both legs; the affected limb is colder than the unaffected side. The patient reports a significant unintentional weight loss over the last few months due to loss of appetite because of persistent pain.  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus poorly controlled with metformin for the past 10 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a 35-pack-year smoking history  and he quit smoking 5 years ago. His father had a history of peripheral artery disease and underwent an amputation due to critical limb ischemia.  On examination  the right foot appears pale with diminished pulses  evident skin atrophy  and multiple non-healing ulcers  the largest ulcer measuring about 2 cm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the foot. One of the toes has a blackish discoloration suggesting gangrene.  Based on his history  family history  and physical examination  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is made. The patient is then scheduled for further investigations including ankle-brachial index and vascular imaging for detailed assessment. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,94,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 72-year-old Hispanic male presenting with symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia. He complains of severe pain in his right lower extremity  primarily in the foot  even at rest. He also reports a few non-healing ulcers on his right foot that have progressively worsened over the last few weeks. Upon further questioning  it is discovered that Mr. Rodriguez often experiences muscle weakness and cramps in the same leg when walking  typically relieved by rest. He denies any direct trauma or injury.  He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and a 40-pack-year smoking history up until the year 2000 when he quit smoking. He was prescribed statin therapy and low dose aspirin 4 years ago to manage atherosclerosis and to prevent cardiovascular events. He's on Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension.  Despite aggressive management  Mr. Rodriguez's PAD has gradually worsened over the past year  with claudication symptoms now affecting his routine daily activities. Given the worsening ulcers  severe pain  and lifestyle-limiting claudication  the presentation suggests the possibility of critical limb ischemia. These symptoms along with his past medical history put him at an increased risk for limb loss if not treated urgently.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,95,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Emanuele  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents in the emergency department with severe intermittent claudication in his right lower limb  which has gradually worsened over the last year. He states that the pain has escalated rapidly over the past week or two and has become unbearable - even at rest  and especially in the evening  interfering with his sleep. He also mentioned that he recently noticed a slowly-healing ulcer on his right foot.   Mr. Emanuele is a long-time smoker  burning through approximately a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years  and he maintains a steady consumption of alcohol. He has multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes Metformin  and chronic hypertension  managed with Amlodipine. He also has a known history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed 5 years ago  and coronary artery disease (CAD)  which was managed with a drug-eluting stent 7 years ago.  He migrated to the United States from Italy 25 years ago  is a retired factory worker  and lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. His father had a history of PAD and had a below-knee-amputation  while his mother had CAD and died following a myocardial infarction. He doesn't use recreational drugs  and he denies having any allergies. The remainder of his family history and review of systems was noncontributory.   On examination  the right lower limb seems mildly edematous and pallor is noticeable  particularly in the foot. Also  distal pulses in the right lower limb are barely palpable  and there appears to be a small  painful  poorly healing ulcer on the sole of the right foot. These findings  in addition to his history and risk factors  point towards progression towards critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,96,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony Clark  a 67-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe pain in his left lower limb  primarily below the knee. The pain has been ongoing for the past two months but has significantly worsened over the past week making it difficult for him to walk or even rest. He describes the pain as """"burning"""" and """"crushing"""" in nature. Mr. Clark hasn't experienced any trauma to the limb and reports that the pain often intensifies when at rest  particularly at night. Along with the pain  he's noticed that his lower limb is cold to touch and has become noticeably paler compared to the other limb.  Relevant past medical history includes type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago  essential hypertension for the last 10 years  and a 45-year history of smoking  about a pack a day  though he quit five years ago. Record also shows he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting three years back. He has not yet undergone any peripheral artery disease-related procedures or surgeries.  Mr. Clark lives with his wife and is retired from a corporate job. His diabetes is mostly controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents. He also takes antihypertensive medication daily. He denies any history of illicit drug use or familial predisposition to vascular disease."
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,97,Patient Profile: Mr. Albert Rivera is a 67-year-old Hispanic male retiree who presents to the clinic today with complaints of pain in his right lower leg  muscle weakness  and non-healing wounds on his foot. He has a history of tobacco use (40 pack years) and reports moderate consumption of alcohol. He is a former factory worker and has been retired for the past 5 years.  Medical History: Mr. Rivera has a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 10 years ago)  is currently on Metformin and regularly monitors his diabetes status. He also has hypertension controlled by Lisinopril and Amlodipine  as well as a documented history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed two years ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Present Health Status: In the past few weeks  he reports an increased level of discomfort in his right lower leg  particularly after walking short distances or during the night. He also noticed the appearance of some small non-healing ulcers on his foot. Last week he felt sudden muscle weakness while climbing a flight of stairs and needed help to get up. His appetite is fair  and he has no significant weight loss. He is adherent to his diabetes medications and controls his blood sugar levels well (last HbA1C was 6.9%).   Physical Exam: An arterial pulse examination indicated a weakened pulse in the affected limb. Upon inspection  the right lower leg showed signs of pallor and his right foot was cool to touch. There were signs of atrophy in the leg muscles and non-healing ulcers were observed on his right foot.   With his presenting symptoms  established risk factors of smoking and history of diabetes and PAD  we suspect a possibility of critical limb ischemia. His condition appears to have deteriorated and requires further investigation through imaging studies to determine the severity of arterial occlusion and necessary treatment steps. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,98,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 74-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department with severe rest pain in his right lower limb that has been persisting for the last week. He explains that the pain is more pronounced during the night  often disturbing his sleep. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his right foot which occurred about a month ago. On questioning  he says there is no relevant trauma or injury he recalls.  His vital signs taken are within normal ranges except for a mildly elevated blood pressure of 150/90mmHg. A physical examination revealed coldness of the right foot  absence of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the right limb  and the presence of discolored skin around the foot ulcers.  Mr. Johnson's past medical history is significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for 20 years  hypertension  and a 35-pack years history of smoking. He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  and a statin  although he admits occasional noncompliance to his medications. He has no known drug allergies. He lives alone at home and retired as a schoolteacher five years ago. He denies alcohol use but has been smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years.  Given the severe ischemic symptoms coupled with his past medical history and corporate lifestyle  the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is highly suspected  and an urgent vascular consult is being sought.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,99,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Roberts is a 72-year-old African American male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease. He's a chronic smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He presents to the emergency department with escalating pain in his left lower leg that has been worsening over the past two months. The pain is characteristically present even at rest and has been disturbing his sleep. He also reports skin color changes and noticeable temperature difference between his two legs.   He tells about a non-healing wound on his left heel. On examination  the leg appears pale and cold to touch with feeble peripheral pulses. He rates his pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. He incurred a minor injury to his heel 4 weeks ago  after which the lesion has progressively enlarged and become more painful. His medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and he underwent a coronary artery stent placement eight years ago.  His diabetes is poorly controlled  with his last HbA1c recorded six months ago at 9.4%. He is on medications which include amlodipine  lisinopril  metformin and aspirin. Despite advice from his general practitioner  he continues to smoke about half a pack of cigarettes daily. There is no known drug allergy. He used to work as an auto mechanic and lives with his wife. His last foot check-up was carried out over a year ago.   His lifestyle habits and poor adherence to medication regimes suggest a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia which is likely triggered by a combination of his peripheral artery disease and uncontrolled diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,2,100,Patient Presentation:  A 69-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with significant pain in his right lower extremity  which he reports has been ongoing for the past month  but has escalated in intensity over the past week. He describes the pain as constant  severe  and not relieved by rest. He also reports the presence of non-healing sores on his right foot.   The patient has a past medical history of a 25-year pack-history of smoking  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been poorly controlled. He has never undergone any peripheral vascular or endovascular procedures in the past. On physical examination  his right foot appears pale  cool to the touch  and has a noticeable loss of hair. Doppler sonography reveals markedly reduced blood flow to the extremity.  The patient’s symptoms and clinical evaluation suggest Critical Limb Ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease. The non-healing sores on his foot  decreasing circulation  and severe pain even while resting are indicative of this condition. His past medical history of smoking  hypertension  and poorly controlled diabetes also increase the risk. The patient is immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for potential revascularization procedures.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,1,Title: A Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Slide 1: Introduction In this presentation  we will review the case of a 71-year-old African American male with critical limb ischemia (CLI). This demographic group represents a significant portion of CLI patients as per various studies. CLI is typically observed with advancing age and is more prevalent in African American populations.  Slide 2: Patient Information Our patient  Mr. C  is a retired mechanic. He lives with his wife and their dog in an urban area. He has a documented history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. C was diagnosed with Type II DM 18 years ago. He has been on metformin and insulin therapy. His PAD was diagnosed 7 years back. He has also been treated for hyperlipidemia and hypertension  which are common comorbidities in CLI patients.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaints Mr. C presented with severe pain in the left foot  even while at rest. He also reported notable skin color changes. He has experienced slow-healing sores  particularly on his toes and lower legs – hallmark signs of CLI.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination Upon examination  Mr. C displayed pronounced ischemic rest pain. His pedal pulses were found to be severely diminished. Coolness of skin in the left limb  reduced hair growth  and shiny skin were noted  suggesting progressive CLI.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Tests An Ankle Brachial Index test was carried out revealing a significantly reduced ABI < 0.40. Further  Doppler ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Angiography confirmed the presence of several occlusions in both superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.  Slide 7: Management & Discussion Mr. C’s management included medical therapy for pain  wound care  strict glycemic control  cholesterol control  and antiplatelet therapy. He underwent revascularization therapy  aiding the establishment of blood flow around the blocked arteries.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case illustrates the typical presentation of CLI in a high-risk demographic. Co-management of DM  PAD and lifestyle changes form the core to effective CLI management in such cases. Critical awareness and prompt action help mitigate the potentially severe repercussions  including limb loss.  Slide 9: References & Q/A Various references used for this case study.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,3,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) Patient Case Presentation  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Patient: 70-year-old African American male. Incidence and prevalence of CLI are found to be higher among older male patients  particularly among African American populations.   Slide 3: Past Medical History • History of tobacco use: Heavy smoking history of 30 years  quit 10 years ago. CLI is significantly tied to tobacco use due to the harmful effect on blood vessels. • Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years. Diabetes presents a significant risk for the development of CLI due to its effect on the microvascular system. • Chronic hypertension for the last 20 years. Chronic arterial hypertension is frequently identified as a comorbid factor in patients with CLI. • Mechanism of injury: Patient presents with history of sudden onset of intense right leg pain started a week ago.  Slide 4: Signs & Symptoms  • Severe  chronic pain in his right foot and calf • Right lower extremity is noticeably colder than the left • Presence of non-healing sores on the right foot • Absence of pulse in the right foot  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tools  Several key diagnostic tools to confirm CLI such as Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)  and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA).  Slide 6: Potential Treatment  After diagnosis  treatment option for our patient could include: • Medications to control pain and improve blood flow • Minimally invasive procedures like angioplasty • Bypass surgery • Amputation in severe  non-resolving cases   Slide 7: Prognosis  Prognosis for patients with CLI can vary significantly  depending on the severity of the condition  the risk factors present  and the timing and effectiveness of treatment.   Slide 8: Conclusion  This case study emphasizes the need for increased awareness and early detection of CLI especially among high risk patients. It also highlights the importance of comorbidity management in the prognosis of CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,4,"Title: A Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction and Demographics The presentation will focus on a 65-year-old African American male  Mr. X from Los Angeles  exemplifying the demographic group most vulnerable to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Studies have shown that CLI predominantly affects males  particularly of African American ethnicity and aged above 60.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. X has a substantial past medical history that includes: - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for ten years  controlled by oral hypoglycemic medication. - Hypertension controlled with ACE inhibitors. - Tobacco use history reflective of a 20 pack-year history. - Previous medical interventions include coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) performed 5 years ago.  Slide 3: Onset of Symptoms Approximately six months ago  Mr. X noticed mild pain in his right calf when walking long distances. He experienced rest pain and non-healing ulcers in his right foot over the past three months. The pain has progressively worsened  causing sleep disturbances and promoting a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 4: Physical Examination Considerable atrophy of the right calf muscles is observed. There are non-healing ulcers on his right toes and foot  exhibiting dry gangrene. On auscultation  considerably diminished/absent pulses in the right lower extremity (Dorsalis pedis and Posterior Tibial arteries).  Slide 5: Diagnosis An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  noted to be less than 0.4  suggestive of severe peripheral artery disease. A subsequent Doppler ultrasound confirmed high-grade stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery and right popliteal artery. A diagnosis of """"Critical Limb Ischemia"""" was made  characterized by rest pain  non-healing foot ulcers  and evidence of gangrene.  Slide 6: Recommended Treatment  Considering the severity of Mr. X's condition  an urgent vascular surgery consult is advocated. A peripheral angiogram to locate the arterial blockage and potential peripheral angioplasty or bypass surgery dependent upon angiogram results. Wound care for non-healing ulcers plus aggressive glycemic and hypertension control also part of the comprehensive management plan.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of early identification and aggressive management of risk factors in patients at risk of CLI. Besides  it brings to light the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of this life-threatening condition. A multidisciplinary approach remains the mainstay of treating CLI.  End of Presentation."
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,5,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Critical Limb Ischemia - A Case Presentation   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr. X  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. An important point to note from literature is that critical limb ischemia predominantly occurs in individuals over the age of 60  with men being slightly more affected than women. Racial disparities have also been identified in the incidence and outcomes of critical limb ischemia  with higher rates seen among Caucasian and Hispanic patients.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. X has a significant past medical history of: - Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  poorly controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents. - Smoking: He has a 40 pack-year smoking history.  - Peripheral Artery Disease diagnosed 3 years ago. This puts Mr. X in the category of high-risk individuals for critical limb ischemia  as medical literature highlights diabetes  tobacco use  and pre-existing vascular disease as prime risk factors.  Slide 4: History of Present Illness For the past six weeks  Mr. X has complained of severe rest pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the calf area. He describes this pain as worsening at night. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his left foot. On inquiring  he admits to significant weight loss over the past few months.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  On examination  the left lower limb appears pale  with marked hair loss. Pulses are absent on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial areas. Several poorly healing ulcers with black eschar are noted on his foot.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Given the patient's age  demographic  significant risk factors  symptoms  and physical findings  a working diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made.  Slide 7: Investigations To confirm the diagnosis and plan out the treatment  following investigations were ordered: - Ankle-Brachial Index test - Doppler Ultrasound of the affected limb - CT angiography of lower limb arteries  Slide 8: Treatment & Prognosis The treatment for critical limb ischemia is multi-pronged and includes pain management  wound care  angioplasty or bypass surgery  and lifestyle changes  particularly smoking cessation and optimal control of diabetes. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis  the extent of arterial occlusion  and the patient's overall health status.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case underlines the importance of early detection and aggressive management of critical limb ischemia  particularly in high-risk individuals like Mr. X. Timely intervention  coupled with lifestyle modification  can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk of amputation.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,8,Title: A Case Study Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction - Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries  dramatically reducing blood-flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has severe ramifications for patients.  - Major risk factors include being over age 60  smoking  diabetes  obesity  and high blood pressure.  - Here we present the case of Mr. R  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with critical limb ischemia.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics and Past Medical History - Mr. R is a 65-year old Caucasian male. He is a retired truck driver and has a 40-year history of smoking at least a pack of cigarettes daily. - The patient has Type II diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 15 years ago  and hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago. Both conditions are sub-optimally controlled.  - He is also obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  - Mr. R presents with severe rest pain in his right foot  which has worsened over the past two months. - He reports intermittent claudication  wounds in the foot that are not healing well  and numbness in his lower extremities.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination - On physical examination  his right foot was pale  cold to touch  with weak pedal pulses. - An ulcerative lesion was noted on the right metatarsal area. There was marked pallor on elevation and rubor on dependency. - No significant findings on examination of the heart and other systems.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,18,Title: A Case Study of Critical Limic Ischemia – A Comprehensive Review   Slide 1: Introduction - Patient X  a 72-year-old African American male  non-smoker  came to the Emergency Room with severe pain and numbness in his right lower extremity that has progressively worsened over the past 6 weeks.  Slide 2: Demographics - Statistically  the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  which often leads to critical limb ischemia  is higher among African American and Hispanic populations in the US. The condition affects males more often than females and its occurrence escalates with age.   Slide 3: Past Medical History - Patient X has a medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are both risk factors for PAD. He has had coronary artery disease and underwent a triple coronary bypass surgery 12 years ago. He also has occasional bouts of dyslipidemia  which isn't consistently managed.  Slide 4: Presenting Issue - At presentation  Patient X had notable rest pain  primarily in the foot  which is being exacerbated at night. The pain often wakes him up and he resorts to dangling his leg off the side of the bed for relief. Patient X's right foot exhibits pallor upon elevation and a dusky red discoloration when dependent.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Results - Non-invasive vascular studies showed remarkably reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI). Doppler waveform analysis showed monophasic flow in the distal right extremity. CT angiography indicated multi-level occlusive disease in the right lower extremity  suggestive of critical limb ischemia.  Slide 6: Treatment - The patient was initially managed with analgesics and an optimized anti-platelet regimen. An intervention is planned to re-establish blood flow using endovascular techniques such as balloon angioplasty.  Slide 7: Conclusion - Management and prognosis of patients with critical limb ischemia  like Patient X  largely depend on timely diagnosis  risk factor modification  and effective revascularization.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,20,Title: Patient Case Presentation: Critical Limic Ischemia   Slide 1: Introduction Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. CLI is a chronic condition that results from narrowing and hardening of the arteries.  Slide 2: Case Demographics Based on available literature  CLI predominantly affects older individuals with increased prevalence in males. Today we will discuss the case of a 71-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. R. This matches the demographic known to be at high risk for CLI: individuals above 70 years of age  male  and Caucasian.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. R has a past medical history which includes type 2 diabetes  peripheral artery disease  hypertension  dyslipidemia and he is a former smoker. History also reveals instances of intermittent claudication with increasing severity over the past 12 months.  Slide 4: Presenting symptoms  Recently  Mr. R presented with recurrent rest pain in the right foot (particularly the toes)  non-healing ulcers on the lower leg and foot. The pain often becomes severe  especially at night.  Slide 5: Diagnostic findings  Physical examination revealed decreased pulses in the lower extremities and mild sensory loss. An ankle-brachial index was performed and showed a result of 0.4 for the right leg—indicating severe blockage. An angiogram further confirmed multi-level stenosis.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan  The treatment plan for Mr. R involved a combination of medical management and revascularization to relieve his symptoms and preserve the limb. Medications like antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents were prescribed. For the revascularization process  an endovascular approach was selected over surgical due to Mr. R’s age and comorbidities.   Slide 7: Overview Understanding the demographics and medical history of Mr. R  we can see how typical he is in the presentation and progression of CLI. Notably  his diagnosis is a reminder of the importance of managing risk factors including hyperglycemia  hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and smoking for individuals with a similar demographic profile.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,22,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe arterial disease characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  and gangrene in the extremities. It most frequently affects the elderly and those with a history of smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 2: Patient's Demographics The patient is a 73-year-old African American male  a demographic significantly affected by CLI  based on numerous epidemiological studies. Under-represented minority groups  particularly African Americans  have been found to have higher rates of CLI diagnosis.  Slide 3: Medical History The patient has a 15-year history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). He has also been a chronic smoker for way over 40 years but quit 3 years ago. As represented in the literature  these conditions serve as significant risk factors for CLI.  Slide 4: Past Surgeries The patient has undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) approximately 20 years ago due to coronary artery disease (CAD). He also went through a balloon angioplasty procedure for lower extremity PAD around 10 years prior. These surgical procedures indicate a history of severe cardiovascular disease.  Slide 5: Current Symptoms The patient presented with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower extremity  noticeable skin discolorations  and a non-healing ulcer on the right foot – typical signs and symptoms of critical limb ischemia.  Slide 6: Clinical Examination Upon physical examination  decreased sensation in the right foot was diagnosed along with a cold foot  diminished/absent peripheral pulses  and atrophic skin changes. These clinical features imply advanced disease and possible poor outcome.  Slide 7: Diagnostic Results An ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.4  and Radiological findings consistent with severe PAD confirmed the diagnosis. Furthermore  confirmation by angiography showed multiple occlusions in the superficial femoral artery and tibial arteries.  Slide 8: Prognosis and Treatment The patient's demographic  past medical history  and symptoms of CLI suggest a high risk for major limb amputations and increased mortality. The aggressive management of T2DM  along with revascularization procedures  forms the cornerstone of treatment to improve prognosis.  Slide 9: Conclusion CLI is a severe disease demanding prompt management. Patient background - like age  race  smoking history  and comorbidity -  must be evaluated to determine the severity and prognosis. Comprehensive care that includes aggressive management of comorbid conditions and suitable revascularization procedures is crucial for effective management.

By understanding the specifics of this case  we can enlighten ourselves and optimize strategies for prevention  diagnosis  and treatment.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our subject is a 72-year-old African American male  Mr. X  given that CLI has been reported to be more prevalent in this demographic  according to an observation in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study). His lifestyle includes 40 years of smoking and a sedentary job  which are considered risk factors.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. X was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 10 years ago. His medical history also includes hyperlipidemia  indicating a risk of atherosclerosis and thus  CLI. He had been on medication for diabetes (metformin) and hypertension (lisinopril)  but the lack of health awareness and minimal physical activities escalated his conditions.   Slide 4: Current Medical Situation Mr. X first reported symptoms of intermittent claudication  characterized by pain in his leg that was alleviated by rest. However  over time  his symptoms escalated to pain at rest and non-healing ulcers on the feet–classic symptoms of CLI.   Slide 5: Clinical Examination   On examination  Mr. X's affected limb displayed a cold temperature  pale color  and an absence of peripheral pulses. Doppler ultrasound showed a severely reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI). Additionally  an angiogram displayed multi-level occlusive disease  confirming CLI.  Slide 6: Management and Follow-up Mr. X underwent successful revascularization  and was prescribed antiplatelets and statins to mitigate further risk. His condition stabilized with cessation of smoking and the introduction of regular physical activities. A regular follow-up and ABI measurement are planned to monitor his state and prevent any reoccurrence.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,33,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI)  Slide 1: Introduction Critical limb ischemia is a severe obstruction of the arteries  significantly reducing blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point where severe pain  even while resting  can often occur. The presentation will examine a real-life case to enhance the understanding of CLI.  Slide 2: Patient's Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male  following the demographic trends of CLI which predominantly affects those aged 60 - 80  and observed with a slightly higher prevalence in males and racial minorities  particularly African-Americans.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hyperlipidemia  Hypertension  and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). The patient has a 40-pack year history of smoking  revealing a lifestyle laced with high CLI risk factors.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient complains about severe pain in the right lower extremity  especially while at rest  which is consistent with the classic symptoms of CLI. Additionally  he reported skin ulcers on the same leg that aren't showing any signs of healing. The patient is also noted to have a reduced sensation in the lower extremity.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Considering the severe rest pain  presence of non-healing ulcers  and the past medical history  the patient was diagnosed with CLI. Additional investigations  like ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  and angiography  confirmed the diagnosis.  Slide 6: Management and Prognosis The patient underwent revascularization for his symptoms given his mobility and persistent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. Both endovascular techniques and bypass surgery were options for revascularization and specific treatment was decided based on consultation with a vascular surgeon. The patient was also recommended lifestyle changes  including smoking cessation  blood pressure control  and attention to foot care.  Slide 7: Conclusion Critical limb ischemia is a serious disease  often resulting from several risk factors. Aged patients with histories of diabetes  smoking  and PAD are at significantly higher risks. An early and accurate diagnosis is key in the management of CLI  as timely interventions can prevent amputation and improve the quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,39,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia: A Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously decreases blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to the point of severe rest pain  skin ulcers  or even gangrene. It's the most advanced form of peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male  with a history of smoking  reflective of existing literature which shows a higher prevalence of PAD and CLI in the African-American community  compared to other ethnic groups in the United States.  Literature also shows a higher incidence of PAD among older individuals and those who smoke.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and coronary artery disease  which are all well-documented risk factors for developing CLI. He quit smoking ten years ago but had a 30-pack-year smoking history.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  The patient reported rest pain in the left lower extremity  particularly at night  with non-healing ulcers on his left foot. This has resulted in severe impairment of his ability to undertake daily activities  and an increasing dependency on others for care and support.  Slide 5: Physical Examination Upon examination  skin color and temperature changes were observed with decreased or absent pulses in his left foot. An ulcer  roughly 2 cm in diameter  was seen on the dorsum of his foot with the surrounding skin appearing dusky and indicative of poor perfusion.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Studies An ankle-brachial index confirmed the presence of significant PAD  with a score of 0.3 on the left (normal being 1.0-1.4). Further  angiography portrayed multiple arterial blockages in the patient's left lower extremity.  Slide 7: Prognosis & Discussion The patient is at a high risk of amputation and cardiovascular events  including myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke. His care plan incorporates managing underlying health conditions  improving lifestyle factors  pain management  and might potentially involve procedures to increase blood flow to the affected limb.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,40,Title: Case Presentation: Critical Limic Ischemia in Elderly Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction This case presentation illustrates an instance of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in our patient  a condition characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene due to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.  Slide 2: Demographics Patient X is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. According to literature  CLI is common in elderly individuals aged 60 and above  with a higher prevalence in males. The disease also disproportionately affects individuals of black descent  although it's not our patient's case.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Patient X has a considerable and relevant past medical history. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and atherosclerosis. All these conditions are recognized as significant risk factors for CLI. The patient has been also a smoker for over 30 years  further contributing to his risk.   Slide 4: Patient Presentation  The patient presents with severe pain in his right lower extremity  which has worsened over the past two months. The pain is often experienced at rest and increasingly disturbs his sleep. He also has a non-healing ulcer on his right foot.  Slide 5: Diagnosis In addition to clinical examination  Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed and resulted below 0.4  indicating severe limb ischemia. Further angiography revealed significant multi-level arterial occlusive disease in the right leg  confirming the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Slide 6: Treatment and Management  The patient's management plan includes both surgical intervention and lifestyle modification. Endovascular therapy was performed  focusing on revascularization. The patient was also advised to control his diabetes  quit smoking  and manage his blood pressure— all of which are vital for reducing the progression of the disease.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case underscores the value of early detection and treatment of risk factors by healthcare professionals for preventing severe complications like CLI in at-risk populations. Consequently  primary care providers should remain vigilant during examinations and consultations with patients who have a history of diabetes  hypertension  and smoking.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,50,Title: A Case Study of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Slide 1: Introduction  Critical Limb Ischemia commonly referred to as CLI  is a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood-flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores.  Slide 2: Demographics and Prevalence  CLI affects about 12% of the general population  primarily those aged 50 and above. It is more prevalent among males with a ratio of 2:1 males to females  and is more common in the African American population.  Slide 3: Case Study Introduction Our patient  Mr. J  is a 67-year-old African American male with a prior medical diagnosis of type-2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and history of tobacco use.  Slide 4: Presentation  Mr. J presented with severe pain in his right foot which had advanced over the last six months. He had rest pain  non-healing ulcers on his right toes  and has noticed skin discoloration.  Slide 5: Relevant Past Medical History  Mr. J has a 10-years history of type-2 diabetes  managed with insulin  hyperlipidemia controlled with a statin  and a 30-pack year history of smoking (1 pack/day for 30 years)  though he quit 5 years ago.   Slide 6: Physical Examination  On examination  he had weak pedal pulses  dry gangrene of two toes  and dependent rubor. There was a palpable popliteal pulse but no femoral or distal pulses on the right lower limb.  Slide 7: Diagnosis and Management  Duplex Ultrasound revealed decreased blood flow in the femoral artery  and angiography indicated a right superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusion. Mr. J was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  The multidisciplinary team decided for Revascularization which involved Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) with stenting.   Slide 8: Rehabilitation and Prevention Post-procedure Mr. J participated in a supervised exercise program and maintained a strict control of his glucose levels and cholesterol. He was also educated about the importance of foot care and regular follow-ups.  Slide 9: Conclusion CLI is a severe peripheral arterial disease that requires early detection for better prognosis. As healthcare professionals  we should aim for early detection and proper management of patients like Mr. J.  Slide 10: References Includes suitable references to literature and case studies.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,51,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly African American Male: A Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrenes in one or both legs. It's often associated with considerable morbidity  mortality  and reduced quality of life.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Today we present a 72-years old African American male patient Mr. X  retired and living with his family in an urban setting. This demographic group is particularly significant as according to the Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) in the U.S. report  African American men are disproportionately affected by PAD  a precursor to CLI.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. X has a medical history significant for Type 2 diabetes for 15 years  hypertension for 10 years  and a 20-pack year history of smoking. He also has a history of dyslipidemia and intermittent claudication  with reduced exercise tolerance for the past 2 years.  Slide 4: Disease Progression  The patient was previously managing these conditions with medication and lifestyle changes. However  over the last six months  he has developed rest pain in the right lower leg  initially dismissed as normal leg pain due to aging. Recently  non-healing ulcers developed on his right foot. His history of diabetes  smoking  hypertension  and dyslipidemia increases his risk of developing CLI.  Slide 5: Clinical indicators and Diagnosis  On physical examination  right foot was colder compared to the left  pulses in the right lower limb were significantly diminished. Non-invasive vascular studies showed markedly decreased ankle-brachial index on the right side. Doppler ultrasound displayed severely compromised blood flow. Based on these findings  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was established.  Slide 6: Proposed treatment   The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for consideration of revascularization procedures. In adjunct  aggressive control of his diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia is required. The patient was advised to quit smoking and blood thinners were prescribed to prevent clot formation.  Slide 7: Discussion  CLI is a significant issue  particularly in the African American population. This case illustrates the importance of considering CLI in the differential diagnosis when an elderly patient with multiple risk factors presents with chronic limb pain and non-healing ulcers. Early diagnosis and aggressive management are crucial to prevent disease progression and improve patient outcomes.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,53,Title: Management of A Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI) Case in a Geriatric Patient   Slide 1: Case Introduction  Our patient is a 72-year-old Hispanic female  from an urban setting  suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI) on her left lower limb. This demographic reflects the fact that CLI is more prevalent amongst the geriatric population  particularly affecting females  and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by peripheral artery disease (PAD) leading to CLI.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient's past medical history includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (for the past 15 years) and hypertension (for 20 years)  both poorly controlled. She's also a former smoker  having quit 10 years back. These comorbidities accurately reflect the fact that CLI is often associated with such systemic diseases and lifestyle habits.  Slide 3: History of Presenting Complaint  Over the past 6 months  the patient has been experiencing intermittent claudication after walking short distances (less than one block)  rest pain for the past two months  and a non-healing ulcer on the left foot for the last month. This progression is consistent with the natural history of CLI.  Slide 4: Physical Examination  Physical examination shows a small non-healing ulcer over the distal aspect of the left foot  pallor on leg elevation and dependent rubor. Pulses in the left foot are weak  and the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is <0.40.  Slide 5: Investigations  A Doppler ultrasound is performed  confirming decreased blood flow in the left lower limb. CT angiography reveals multi-level arterial stenosis in the left lower extremity  consistent with the patient's symptomatology.  Slide 6: Plan  Immediate revascularization via angioplasty is planned  as the patient is not a surgical candidate given her age and comorbid conditions. Optimal medical therapy and lifestyle habit modification therapy are also initiated.  This case discusses a typical presentation of CLI in a Hispanic geriatric female with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  providing a comprehensive overview for CLI management in this demographic.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,54,Slide 1:  Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 2: Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe stage of peripheral artery disease  characterized by chronic pain  non-healing sores or gangrene in feet or legs. This condition often indicates severe arterial disease. The presentation aims to delve into a representative case of a patient with CLI.  Slide 3:  Demographics: According to studies  CLI is more prevalent in older individuals  especially in those over 60. The patients are often male and with a high prevalence in the Hispanic population. For the purpose of this case  we'll discuss Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male.  Slide 4:  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Rodriguez presents with a non-healing sore on his right heel  chronic pain in his right lower extremity  and increasing difficulty in walking.   Slide 5:  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypercholesterolemia  and hypertension. He is also a former smoker  with a 30 pack-year history of smoking.  Slide 6:  Physical Examination: On examination  there is a noticeable absence of pulses in the right lower leg  the presence of a non-healing ulcer on the right heel  and decreased sensation in the right foot.  Slide 7:  Relevant Tests and Diagnosis: Mr. Rodriguez was referred to vascular surgery for a Doppler ultrasound  angiogram  and ABPI (Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index) measurement. His ABPI was found to be less than 0.4  confirming a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Slide 8:  MTreatment Plan: He was commenced on medical treatment including antiplatelet agents and statins  and pain management. He then underwent a successful surgical revascularization.  Slide 9:  Prognosis:  Even with successful revascularization  CLI presents high morbidity and mortality rates partially resulting from associated comorbidities  but research shows improved outcomes if CLI is detected and treated early.  Slide 10: Summary:  This case highlights the importance of early detection  risk factor management  and the multidisciplinary approach to treatment for patients with Critical Limb Ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,55,Title: Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction Title: Ms. Maria Sanchez - A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia Greetings! Today we will be discussing the case of an elderly female patient who presented with a typical case of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This aims to provide a holistic view of her condition from onset to management.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Title: Patient Profile Ms. Maria Sanchez is a 72-year-old Hispanic/Latina woman hailing from Los Angeles  California. Literature suggests that CLI is more prevalent in people over 70  and is more common in men  nonetheless women represent 40% of patients. The racial and ethnic disparities suggest that Hispanic Americans might have a higher incidence  with non-Hispanic Blacks having the worst prognosis.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Title: Health Background Ms. Sanchez has a complicated medical history with hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  high cholesterol  obesity  and is a former smoker. She is currently being treated for her conditions. Her past medical history indicates her as high-risk for developing peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Slide 4: Current Clinical Presentation Title: Symptoms and Diagnosis Ms. Sanchez presents progressive calf pain for several months  associated with walking short distances only  and recent onset of foot numbness at rest. This limited her daily activities significantly. On physical examination  her right foot showed absent pulses  pallor and coolness. An Ankle-Brachial Index was done and showed a value of 0.4  confirming PAD. Further angiography suggests critical limb ischemia.  Slide 5: Management and Prognosis Title: Intervention and Outlook  Ms. Sanchez underwent revascularization  which remains the optimal treatment for CLI. She also started on statins  antiplatelet therapy  and cilostazol for CLI management due to her ischemic symptoms. With ongoing medical management of her underlying conditions  significant lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups  the goal is to relieve her symptoms  heal her ulcers  prevent limb loss  reduce cardiovascular events and mortality.  Slide 6: Conclusion  Title: Summary  Ms. Sanchez exemplifies the crucial need for increasing awareness of CLI  especially in high-risk demographic groups. This case presentation helps us understand the necessity for early detection  accurate diagnosis  and comprehensive management of CLI to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,56,Title: A Case Study of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Patient   Slide 1: Introduction  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  also known as Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)  is a severe arterial disease characterized by chronic inflammation  blood flow obstruction  and progressive tissue damage.   Slide 2: Patient's Demographics • Age: 71 years • Sex: Male • Ethnicity: African American  • Occupation: Retired Industrial Worker (Please note that this mirrors the fact that CLI is often found more commonly in men  African Americans  and individuals over the age of 70)  Slide 3: Past Medical History •  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (12 years) • Hypertension (8 years) • Hyperlipidemia (7 years) • Former smoker (Quit 5 years ago)  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation • Severe pain in the right lower limb  worse at rest • Non-healing ulcer on the right toe  • Significant weight loss over the past few months  Slide 5: Why CLI? Past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension alongside smoking history increases patient vulnerability towards CLI. Symptoms such as rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and unintended weight loss are characteristic signs of Critical Limb Ischemia.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Evaluations • Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI): Revealed an index of 0.3 (indicative of severe artery disease) • Duplex Ultrasound: Suggested poor arterial circulation in the lower extremities  • Angiography: Showed significant arterial blockages in the lower limbs  Slide 7: Discussion  Given patient's clinical presentation and evaluation results  CLI diagnosis is strongly supported. The presentation is a severe manifestation of PAD  requiring immediate and effective treatment.  Slide 8: Conclusion and Further Management Considering the severity of the disease  the primary approach includes lifestyle modifications  rigorous control of underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension  and endovascular procedures for revascularization as necessary. The goal is to alleviate symptoms  prevent disease progression  and improve the patient’s overall quality of life.   This case study underlines the importance of early recognition  proper evaluation and timely intervention in managing Critical Limb Ischemia  especially among high-risk groups.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,57,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation: Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Slide 2: Demographics  - Patient: 73-year-old Caucasian male - Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer - Marital Status: Married   Note: Our demographic presentation aligns with most reported literature  indicating that CLI is more prevalent amongst the elderly  with a slightly higher occurrence in males (The Vascular Specialist).  Slide 3: Presentation Scenario  The patient presented with a history of gradually progressive pain in his right foot  which has become more intense over the past few weeks. The pain now interrupts his sleep and has limited his mobility.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  - Type-II Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 14 years ago  not consistently controlled. - Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  moderately controlled. - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 7 years ago  well controlled. - History of Smoking: Smoked a pack a day for the past 25 years  quit 5 years ago. - No known allergies  Slide 5: Relevant Family History   - Father died at 65 due to myocardial infarction - Mother had type II diabetes and hypertension - Brother has a history of coronary artery disease  Slide 6: Clinical Examination   Upon clinical examination  the right foot was found to be pale  cold to touch  and had weak peripheral pulses. The foot had an ulcer on the heel that wasn't healing properly.   Slide 7: Initial Assessment   Considering the patient's age  history of vascular risk factors (type II diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking)  poor healing foot ulcer  decreased foot temperature and weak pulses  a working diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is proposed.  Slide 8: Significance   This case underlines the relationship between common vascular risk factors and the development of CLI  the importance of awareness about this condition  and the need to manage vascular risk factors efficiently to prevent severe consequences.   Slide 9: Next Steps   Discussion on the diagnostic testing  possible treatment plan and prognosis will follow. This will be with the intent to provide the patient with the best possible care pathway while taking into account his overall health condition.   Slide 10: Conclusion   This concludes the initial presentation of our patient with presumed CLI. The subsequent steps will include confirming the diagnosis and discussing the treatment options to improve the quality of life of our patient and prevent potential limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,58,Title: Case Presentation - Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Patient Introduction Patient profile: 65-year-old African American male  Slide 2: Demographics & Epidemiology This patient group is reflective of the epidemiological data where CLI is more prevalent among males  African American ethnicity  and individuals aged 60 and above. CLI affects nearly 12% of the general population  increasing to 20% among those over the age of 70.  Slide 3:  Past Medical History  • History of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus • Smoker with 40-pack year history • history of Hypertension  • Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) diagnosed five years ago   Slide 4: Representation in Literature Several studies have shown strong associations between CLI and these factors. Smoking  Diabetes Mellitus  and Hypertension are major risk factors for PAD  which can progress to CLI if not managed appropriately.  Slide 5: Presentation & Progression The patient was admitted with symptoms of: • Severe pain in the right lower limb  even while at rest • Non-healing ulcers and sores over toes  • Discoloration of skin to grey-blue  These symptoms are indicative of severe PAD or CLI  characterized by ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene.  Slide 6:  Diagnosis & Management CLI is a medical emergency. Timely diagnosis using Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  ultrasound  CT angiography along with rigorous glucose control  smoking cessation  hypertension control  and possibly revascularization (angioplasty/stent or bypass surgery) form the crux of management in this case.  Slide 7: Educative Point Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe manifestation of PAD. Raising awareness about the risk factors and early detection of PAD  especially in high-risk populations like diabetics  smokers  and hypertensives  could help prevent progression to CLI.   Slide 8: Conclusion The current patient’s case underlines the necessity for regular monitoring of individuals with PAD to possibly halt the evolution toward CLI  using lifestyle modification  strict risk factor control  and when necessary  revascularization.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,59,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly African American Male  Slide 1: Introduction Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) represents an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease typically characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain or ischemic skin lesions. African Americans tend to have the highest prevalence of Peripheral Artery Disease and are twice as likely as Caucasians to be hospitalized for CLI. Today  we will delve into a case that reflects this demographic trend accurately.  Slide 2: Patient Introduction The patient  Mr. J  is a 72-year-old African American male  retired mechanic  originally from New Orleans. His main presenting complaint is a non-healing wound on his left foot and persistent pain in the same leg  even at rest.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. J has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both conditions under suboptimal control. He was a heavy smoker but quit approximately ten years ago. He also reports intermittent claudication for the past 2 years.  Slide 4: Physical Examination On physical examination  Mr. J's left foot displays a small ulcer on the big toe and noticeable gangrenous changes along the lateral aspect. No appreciable distal pulses are palpable on the affected limb  lending concern of severe peripheral arterial insufficiency.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings Ankle-brachial index is significantly reduced. The color Doppler ultrasound reveals a high-grade stenosis in the left femoral artery. The skin temperature of the affected limb is lowered  with an overall pale appearance.  Slide 6: Conclusion Mr. J's age  race  presence of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  previous smoking habits  and characteristics of his symptoms fit well within the profile of a patient vulnerable to CLI. This case underscores the importance of vigilant limb inspection in diabetes  early symptom recognition  and demographic factors that can elevate the risk of CLI.   Slide 7: Management Prompt referral to a vascular surgeon  alongside optimal control of blood glucose and blood pressure  can significantly decrease the risk of limb loss in CLI. Smoking cessation  lifestyle modifications  and possible interventions such as angioplasty  bypass surgery or in some cases  amputation  underline the approach to comprehensive CLI management.   Slide 8: Prevention and Education Preventing CLI should focus on improving the control of risk factors such as smoking  diabetes  and hypertension. Community education emphasizing lifestyle modifications and adherence to medications can significantly reduce disease burden  particularly among high-risk demographics such as African American men.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,65,Title: Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia   Slide 1: Introduction and Demographics Presenter discusses:  Our case involves a 65-year-old African-American male  Mr. X. Nationally  critical limb ischemia (CLI) is common in men around this age  partly due to higher prevalence of risk factors like smoking and diabetes. There is also a slightly higher incidence in African-American populations.   Slide 2: Medical History  Presenter discusses: Mr. X is a retired welder  who smoked a pack per day for 40 years before quitting a year ago. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years back  which has been poorly managed. His family history is significant with his mother having passed away from a stroke  and father from a myocardial infarction.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms   Presenter discusses: Mr. X presented with progressive pain in his left lower leg  especially with physical activity  over the last six months. The pain had been worsening  keeping him awake at night and he was noticing leg weakness while climbing stairs. He also revealed that he had a non-healing wound on his left toe.   Slide 4: Examination and Findings  Presenter discusses: Physical exam revealed a weak pulse in the left leg  coldness of the leg below the knee  and the appearance of a gangrenous ulcer on his toe. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test and lower-limb angiogram indicated poor blood flow  supporting our suspicion for critical limb ischemia.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Presenter discusses: Considering Mr. X's advanced age  history of chronic smoking and poorly managed diabetes  along with his symptoms and test results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made.   Slide 6: Treatment Presenter discusses: The treatment plan for Mr. X includes managing his conditions contributing to CLI such as his diabetes and hyperlipidemia. He is also recommended for revascularization therapy - either endovascular (angioplasty and/or stenting) or a form of bypass surgery  to restore blood flow.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Prevention  Presenter discusses: The timely diagnosis and treatment of Mr. X’s CLI condition offers him a good chance for limb salvage  reducing the risk of possible amputation. We will also discuss ways to manage his risk factors more effectively  especially smoking cessation and better diabetes management.  Slide 8: Summary Presenter discusses: This case provides valuable insights into the demographics and risk factors of critical limb ischemia. It emphasizes the importance of early detection and management of the disease itself and underlying conditions  to improve the quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,67,Slide 1: Introduction   Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI): A Case Presentation   Slide 2: Overview We are going to discuss a case on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which decreases blood supply to the extremities. CLI can lead to debilitating pain  skin ulcers  sores  and even amputation if not appropriately managed.  Slide 3: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old African-American male. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (the broader disease category including CLI) is significantly high among the African-American population. He is a retired truck driver and lives with his wife.   Slide 4: Past Medical History  Our patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes  each notably correlated with CLI. He has been a heavy smoker since his early twenties but quit two years ago. He reports occasional alcohol consumption.  Slide 5: Symptom Presentation  He presented with rest pain in his right leg  more pronounced at night. Additionally  he pointed out a non-healing wound on his foot. Pain is persistent despite medication and elevating his leg  even causing sleep disruption  indicative of the severity of his CLI.  Slide 6: Physical Examination  Upon examination  his right leg appeared noticeably paler compared to the left  with diminished pulses noted on the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial. An ulcer approximately 1.5cm in diameter was observed on his right foot.  Slide 7: Diagnostics  Lower extremity arterial Doppler ultrasound showed reduced blood flow to the right lower leg. CT angiography revealed significant stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery.  Slide 8: Management and Treatment  The patient is referred to a vascular surgeon. He is prescribed antiplatelet and cholesterol-lowering medications. He is also recommended to participate in a supervised exercise program. Wound care management is applied for the foot ulcer.  Slide 9: Prognosis  CLI is considered a severe disease with a high mortality and amputation rate. However  the patient’s symptoms  if managed properly through lifestyle change  medication and possible revascularization procedure  may see symptomatic improvement  prevent disease progression  and significantly improve quality of life.  Slide 10: Conclusion CLI is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease requiring prompt diagnosis and management. It is more prevalent in populations with diabetes  hypertension  and among the African-American community. By understanding the risk factors and manifestations  we can identify  manage  and possibly prevent this debilitating condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,68,Slide 1: Introduction Welcome to this medical presentation where we will discuss a case study involving a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Slide 2: Demographics  We are looking at the case of a 68-year-old African-American male. Literature suggests that CLI tends to occur more frequently among males  and affects African-Americans disproportionately.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a substantial past medical history  including the typical risk factors for CLI such as untreated Type II diabetes  uncontrolled hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Patient also has a previous medical history of mild peripheral artery disease (PAD) which was not adequately managed.  Slide 4: Smoking History As is common in many CLI patients  our patient also has a significant smoking history. He has been a heavy smoker for 40 years  further compounding his risk factors for CLI.  Slide 5: Symptoms and Diagnosis  Our patient presented with severe pain in his right leg  unrelieved by analgesics  accompanied by foot sores that were not healing normally. He also noticed skin discolorations and temperature differences in his legs. Based on these symptoms  diagnostic tests were performed  which included Ankle-Brachial Index  Ultrasound Doppler and Angiogram  confirming the diagnosis of severe CLI in the right leg.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan Given the severity of our patient's CLI and the presence of non-healing ulcers  we decided on a treatment plan that included revascularization procedure  which would improve the blood flow to his affected limb. In addition  the patient was strongly advised to quit smoking  manage his diabetes and hypertension under closer medical supervision  and he was prescribed statins to manage his hyperlipidemia.   Slide 7: Conclusion This case exemplifies the importance of controlling known risk factors in CLI and managing early signs of PAD effectively. Timely intervention can prevent the progression of the disease  preserving limb function  and improving patient's quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,72,Title: A Case Study on Critical Limic Ischemia in Older Diabetic Male Patients  Slide 1: Introduction  Patient X  a 75-year-old Caucasian male with a history of Type-2 diabetes mellitus  presents to the vascular clinic with severe rest pain and a non-healing ulcer on the right foot.   Slide 2: Demographics and Past Medical History  Studies show that Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) predominantly affects older adults  especially males. The patient is a former chain smoker with a 20-year chronic history. He has a notable medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  atherosclerosis  and peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Slide 3: Symptomatology and Physical Examination  Patient X revealed significant symptoms suggesting CLI:  1. Rest pain in the right foot  especially at night 2. Non-healing ulcer on the right foot  3. Decreased mobility due to pain 4. Coolness in the lower extremity  particularly right foot  5. Slow or absent pulse in the right foot   Slide 4: Relevance of Demographics  Age  gender  and race/ethnicity are risk factors for CLI. Literature suggests that Caucasians are at higher risk for CLI than other racial/ethnic groups. Smokers  especially chain smokers  and type-2 diabetes patients like our subject have increased risk for atherosclerosis and  in turn  CLI.  Slide 5: Co-morbid Conditions  Past medical history reveals co-existing conditions that can compound CLI. Diabetes increases the risk of PAD  a precursor to CLI. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia can accelerate atherosclerosis  further impeding blood flow to the extremities.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Further investigations are required for final diagnosis  including Doppler ultrasound  CT angiography  and MR angiography. However  the patient's history  physical exam  and symptoms are highly indicative of CLI.  Slide 7: Treatment & Management  CLI is a serious condition requiring immediate management. Treatment would typically include lifestyle modifications  medications  invasive procedures  and close monitoring. The ultimate goal is to restore blood flow  relieve pain  heal ulcers  and salvage the limb.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Given the prevalence and severe outcomes associated with CLI  early detection and specialised treatment are crucial. Through this case  we aim to shed light on the importance of considering predisposing factors like age  gender  race/ethnicity  and chronic conditions in diagnosing and managing CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,73,Title: Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction This presentation is an in-depth case study of a patient suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease. CLI is a condition characterized by chronic ischaemic at-rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene in one or both legs attributable to a proven arterial occlusive disease.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 65-year-old African American male which aligns with the literature that affirms CLI is more prevalent among individuals aged 60-80 years and disproportionately affects African American population followed by Whites or Hispanics.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and a 40-year history of heavy smoking. This presentation of comorbidities is consistent with risk factors identified for CLI – smoking  diabetes and hypertension.  Slide 4: Medical Presentation The patient presents with severe launch pain (Claudication)  non-healing ulcers on the lower leg  and impalpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. He reports escalating pain in his lower limb  particularly when he reclines or elevates his leg.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings Upon angiography  the patient demonstrated severe multilevel peripheral artery disease with infrapopliteal disease. Additionally  Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was calculated to be less than 0.4  further positioning this case in the advanced stages of Peripheral Artery Disease.  Slide 6: Plan of Care & Management Given the extent of the disease  a decision was made for surgical intervention: a bypass graft was deemed necessary to restore blood flow. The patient was also counseled on lifestyle modification- quit smoking  regulate blood glucose level  and manage blood pressure. Based on his diabetic status  foot care education and wound management were also initiated.  Slide 7: Conclusion CLI can generally be prevented by managing risk factors effectively. Our patient's history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension evidently put him at a higher risk. Therefore  it's crucial for clinicians to aggressively manage these conditions to prevent progression to CLI.  (Slide content and numbers can be adjusted per your presentation platform's capacity)
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,74,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia   Slide 1: Introduction  We will be examining a case of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  which is a severe obstruction of blood flow in the arteries. According to the literature  CLI is more common among the elderly  diabetics  smokers  and those with a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Slide 2: Patient Background/Demographics  Our patient is a 68-year-old  African-American male with a 30-year pack history of smoking  who resides in a suburban environment. He used to work as a construction worker but is now retired. He is on a moderate-income bracket and lives with his wife.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has had a history of Type 2 diabetes and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) for the past 15 years. He reports bouts of intermittent claudication that have become progressively worse over the past year. He has a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure.  Slide 4: Recent Health Complications  Recently  the patient has experienced increasing pain in his right lower leg  even whilst at rest. He has also noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on the same leg  causing him great distress.  Slide 5: Critical Limb Ischemia Diagnosis   The patient's symptoms  his history of PAD and diabetes  and the presence of non-healing ulcers suggest a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test and subsequent angiogram confirmed the diagnosis  unveiling significant blockages in his right leg's peripheral arteries.  Slide 6: Course of Treatment   The patient was recommended revascularization to repair the blood flow in his leg through angioplasty or bypass surgery. Secondary measures taken included aggressive diabetes management  cessation of smoking  regular wound care  and medications to prevent blood clots.  Slide 7: Prognosis   With appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications  the patient has the potential for relief from symptoms  improved wound healing  and a lesser risk of limb amputation.  Slide 8: Concluding Remark  Prevention of CLI primarily lies in the control of risk factors  notably smoking  diabetes  and high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and treatment are also key to reducing morbidity and mortality.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,76,Title: A Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia in Elderly Male Patients  Slide 1: Introduction Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which significantly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Slide 2: Demographics Our case study involves a 70-year-old Caucasian male  which is consistent with literature that states CLI is more frequently observed in the over-65 age group  and generally more common in men than women. Racially  this condition is commonly prevalent among Caucasians and Hispanics.  Slide 3: Case Presentation The patient presented in the clinical setting with severe pain in his left  lower leg. He reported rest pain primarily in the foot  and also identified non-healing ulcers on his left foot. His pain had escalated in recent weeks  disrupting his sleep.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has a long history of heavy smoking and Type 2 diabetes. He also has a past medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels. He had been experiencing moderate claudication for the past decade.  Slide 5: Relevant Medical History  The patient's smoking habit and diabetes are clear contributions to his peripheral arterial disease  which has culminated in CLI. His hypertension and high cholesterol levels have likely further contributed to the narrowing and hardening of his arteries.  Slide 6: Discussion The patient's demographic data  coupled with his symptoms and medical history puts him at a high risk for CLI. His long-term risk factors of smoking and diabetes have likely compounded  leading to severe arterial blockage  consistent with critical limb ischemia.  Slide 7: Conclusion In conclusion  this case not only illustrates the devastating effects of CLI but also highlights the importance of managing chronic medical conditions  like diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels  and lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking to reduce the risks of developing peripheral artery diseases. A multidisciplinary approach in clinical practice for early diagnosis and intervention is highly essential to prevent catastrophic outcomes such as limb amputation or even death in patients with CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,86,Title: Critical Limic Ischemia: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Critical Limbic Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which dramatically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point where severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores can occur. CLI is a chronic condition which results in severe pain in the feet or toes  often disturbing sleep.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics and History - Age: 69 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnic Background: African American - Lifestyle Habits: Smoker for more than 40 years - Occupation: Retired construction worker  Previous Medical Conditions:  - History of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  - Hypertension and peripheral artery disease  - Past surgical history of coronary artery bypass graft 6 years ago  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms of CLI The patient reports rest pain particularly disturbing his sleep at night  along with the presence of non-healing wounds on his toes. A gangrenous patch was found on examination on his left little toe. He has also reported severe pain in his calf muscles while walking short distance indicating intermittent claudication.  Slide 4: Risk and Prevalence Patients with CLI  such as ours  are typically in the sixth or seventh decade of life. In general  the prevalence of CLI is higher in males  the African-American population and among smokers and those with diabetes. CLI occurs 10 to 20 times more often in smokers than in those who have never smoked.   Slide 5: Examination and Investigations Physical examination showed reduced temperature in the left foot  diminished or absent peripheral pulses  and skin changes. Non-invasive vascular studies including Ankle-Brachial Pressure index (ABPI)  toe pressure  pulse volume recordings  duplex ultrasound scans and an angiogram were suggested to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment.   Slide 6: Treatment Patterns: CLI is serious and urgent medical condition requiring immediate attention. For this patient  a combination of pharmacotherapy  endovascular techniques  and bypass surgery are considered based on disease severity and location. Aggressive risk factor modification including stop smoking  controlling diabetes and hypertension is also imperative.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Our patient’s age  ethnicity  smoking history  uncontrolled diabetes  and history of heart disease put him at significant risk for CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,3,89,Title: A Case Presentation on Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI)  Slide 1: Case Introduction Our case centers around Mr. Browne  a 73-year-old African American male who has previously been in good health but recently has begun experiencing significant left lower limb discomfort and decreased mobility.  Slide 2: Demographics CLI predominantly afflicts the aging population  most commonly those over the age of 60. African Americans are disproportionately affected given their higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease. Common risk factors include smoking  diabetes  obesity  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol level.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaint Mr. Browne now reports persistent ache in his left foot  even at rest  along with numbness and reduced mobility. His left foot appears paler compared to his right  with a healing ulcer on the big toe.  Slide 4: Clinical Features   CLI is characterized by severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe discomfort and even skin ulcers or sores.  Slide 5: Past Medical History Mr. Browne is a non-smoker with an extensive medical history: Type 2 Diabetes for 15 years (poorly managed)  hypertension (controlled with medication)  and high cholesterol level (on statin therapy).  Slide 6: Current Physical Examination On examination  the left lower extremity is noticeably cooler  with weak pulses. The foot color is pallor and has an ulcer. Capillary refill time is prolonged (>3 secs). Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg and random blood glucose at 9.5 mmol/L.  Slide 7: Diagnosis The clinical presentation and medical history point to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  which is diagnosed by physical examination and angiography showing more than 50% stenosis of the relevant limb artery.  Slide 8: Management  Management of CLI aims to relieve pain  heal the foot sore  prevent limb amputation  improve overall function  and enhance quality of life. The primary interventions are optimal medical treatment (OMT)  revascularization via angioplasty or bypass surgery  amputation if needed  and secondary prevention with lifestyle changes and medication.  Slide 9: Patient Prognosis With timely management and operative intervention  Mr. Browne’s prognosis is expected to be positive in terms of symptom relief and limb salvage. However  the high cardiovascular risk profile calls for stringent risk factor management and long-term follow-up care.    Slide 10: Conclusion  Mr. Browne's case showcases the intricate relationship between CLI  diabetes  and other comorbidities. It underscores the need for a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach to managing this complex and serious disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,3,90,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia - A Clinical Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe blockage in the arteries of lower extremities  which significantly reduces blood flow  causing severe pain  skin ulcers  or gangrene. It is often the advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The incidence of CLI is higher in those aged 50 or over  and it is more prevalent in men.  Slide 2: Case Background  Our case revolves around a 67-year-old Caucasian male from suburban surroundings  who has been a smoker for the past 40 years. The patient was initially diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) 2 years ago.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes  managed with medication. He also has hyperlipidemia and a family history of coronary artery disease. No previous surgeries have been reported.  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation   The patient presented with severe pain in the left leg  constant and unrelieved with rest  which had gradually worsened over the past six months. On physical examination  the left foot was cold  with an absence of pulses distal to the femoral artery  and noticeable pallor on elevation and rubor on dependency. Ulcerations can be seen on the toes.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings   An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was found to be < 0.4  indicating severe artery disease. Duplex ultrasound showed significantly reduced blood flow in the left lower limb. An angiogram showed multilevel occlusive disease from the iliac artery to the tibial arteries.  Slide 6: Management and Outcome  Endovascular intervention was performed to restore blood flow. The patient was prescribed antiplatelet therapy  statins  pain management  and counseled on smoking cessation and blood glucose level maintenance. He was also put under regular follow-up to monitor his condition.   Slide 7: Discussion  Few demographics are at increased risk of CLI  which includes advanced age  males  race (African Americans and Hispanics)  history of smoking  and comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Early diagnosis and aggressive management are vital to reduce the risk of amputation  cardiovascular events  and improve quality of life.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case emphasizes the role of recognizing CLI risk factors  early diagnosis  and aggressive management  keeping in view the current recommendations and guidelines to prevent unwarranted patient morbidity and mortality.

The patient is a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history. His pain is described as a constant  severe aching and is primarily localized to his left calf and foot. He reports associated numbness  and has been experiencing intermittent claudication particularly after walking short distances. On examination  his left foot is noted to be cooler than the right with diminished pulse in his left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. There is also a non-healing ulcer on the left great toe. Furthermore  the patient reports trouble sleeping due to leg pain and has started keeping his left leg in dependent position to relieve pain. His current symptoms are severe enough to prevent him from performing his routine activities.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,6,A 68-year-old African-American male patient  a smoker with a 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  presents with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He is experiencing ongoing pain at rest in his right lower leg  and has noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on his right foot for the past 6 weeks. Patient also states that he has noticed his foot has become progressively cooler compared to the other one and the skin has that started to darken. His pain has been growing severe to the point it now disrupts his sleep. On examination  the pulses in his right leg are markedly reduced. His previous vascular surgery 10 years ago for a similar problem in the left leg resulted in limb salvage.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,7,A 70-year-old African American male with a medical history of Type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease presents to the Emergency Department with an acutely painful  pale right foot  that is cold on touch and pulses are not palpable. The symptoms have been evolving over the past week with the intensity of pain and skin color change noticeably worsening over the past 2 days. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on the same foot. The patient has a long history of smoking (50 pack-years) but quit five years ago. Past medical history also reveals that he has well-controlled hypertension and is on lipid-lowering therapy. His diabetic control is suboptimal  as evidenced by his glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 9.2% (reference: <5.7%) observed three months ago during a routine clinical check-up. He frequently complains of claudication  but the recent onset of rest pain compelled him to seek medical attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,8,A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and smoking presents with a 3-week history of worsening pain in his lower legs  extending to his feet  particularly noticeable at rest. The pain is severe  and previously controlled with over the counter analgesics  which have now become ineffective. The patient reports a change in the color of his legs to a pale tone and a noticeable coldness in comparison to the rest of his body. He has also noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on his feet. He further adds that he has difficulty in walking long distances due to pain but now the pain persists even at rest and wakes him up at night. On his personal history; he has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Family history reveals his father had peripheral artery disease. He has been noncompliant with his diabetes medication  Metformin  for the past year. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath or abdominal pain. Prior assessments of the lower extremities did not note any significant peripheral arterial disease. Pallor  cyanosis  ulcerations  and non-palpable distal pulses are now noted upon physical examination of the lower extremities.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,9,A 70-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of longstanding uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a 40-pack-year smoking history now presents with sharp  severe pain in his left lower extremity that has been worsening over the past few weeks. The pain is persistent  causing him difficulty sleeping. He reports that it intensifies at rest  especially at night  and is slightly relieved by dangling the leg over the side of the bed but notably worsens after walking or climbing stairs. His lower limb appears pale on elevation and rubor on dependency. The patient also mentions the emergence of a non-healing ulcer on his left heel and has started to notice a cold sensation and numbness in the same foot. He tolerates a pain-free walking distance of less than 100 yards. On examination  his left foot is cool to touch  with absent distal pulses and the presence of an ulcer with black necrotic tissue on his left heel. He describes a significant weight loss recently due to a loss of appetite. Family history is notable for peripheral artery disease in his father. He takes metformin for his diabetes and amlodipine for his hypertension. His compliance with medications and follow-up has been inconsistently due to him being a truck driver.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,10,A 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  chronic smoking  and peripheral artery disease (PAD) presents to the emergency department with severe rest pain in his right lower leg at night which has been keeping him awake over the past week. He describes the pain as a constant and excruciating pain in his calf and foot  which is slightly relieved when he moves or dangles his leg over the bed. Additionally  he has noticed a non-healing ulcer of two months duration on the medial aspect of his right great toe. He also mentions a gradual change in color of his right foot to bluish and diminished hair growth on his leg. On physical examination  the right foot appears pale and cold to touch with diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Further assessment reveals poor capillary refilling and dusky discoloration of the right foot. His blood pressure is 155/92 mmHg  and his other vital signs are stable. His history and presentation are highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,11,A 67-year-old Caucasian male  former heavy smoker with a medical history significant for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease  previous heart attack  and hypertension presents with severe  chronic pain in his lower left leg. He reports that the pain typically intensifies at night and often disrupts his sleep. Additionally  he points to a non-healing ulcer on his left foot that has persisted for 3 months despite treatment. Upon examination  the affected limb is colder compared to the other  and the foot has a pale bluish discoloration (cyanosis). Foot pulses are significantly diminished. Rest pain  non-healing ulcers and the bluish discoloration suggest the patient may be suffering from critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,12,An 68-year-old African-American male  with a past medical history of chronic hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled)  and a 45 pack-year smoking habit  presents with worsening  constant left lower limb pain at rest for the past 5 weeks. The patient describes the pain as burning and severe  rating it as an 8/10. He also reports numbness and coldness of the left foot and has a non-healing ulcer on his left heel. He notes to have unintentionally lost weight and has difficulty walking due to the pain and unsteadiness. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease. He lives alone  retired from construction work  and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His current medications include Metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Lisinopril 20 mg once daily.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,13,A 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year history of smoking presents with severe rest pain in his right leg for the last two weeks. The pain has been progressive and consistent even during rest and has escalated severely preventing him from sleeping at night. Earlier  the pain was relieved by hanging the leg down. He also reports development of a non-healing ulcer on the sole of his right foot in the last one week. Furthermore  he reports recent weight loss  anorexia  and constant fatigue. He does not report any chest pain  shortness of breath  or syncope. On examination  the right foot appears pale with decreased temperature and absence of palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. The distal foot ulcer looks infected with surrounding erythema  and local tenderness. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,14,A 67-year-old African-American female with a known history of chronic smoking and diabetes type II presents with severe rest pain in her left lower leg for the past week. On physical examination  there is notable pallor and coolness to touch on the left foot with a mottled appearance  longer capillary refill time  and absence of distal pulses. Additionally  the patient reports non-healing ulcers on her foot and expressed a significant loss of function due to escalating pain at rest. Her HbA1c is poorly controlled  measuring at 8.9%  and she has evidence of peripheral neuropathy. She also reports occasional claudication while walking short distances  which leads to the cessation of activity. She denies any chest pain  dyspnea  or palpitations. There is no reported abdominal discomfort  unexplained weight loss  or change in bowel habits. Her BMI is 32 indicating obesity. This concerning presentation and clinical picture suggest a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,15,A 70-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and 15-year history of smoking presents with progressive pain in his left lower extremity. He reveals symptoms of severe rest pain in his foot lasting for a week  particularly at night. He also notes isolated areas of notable color change (darkened areas) on his left toe which he first noticed a few days ago. Additionally  the patient complains of a significant decrease in mobility over the last few months due to the worsening pain and soreness in his left foot. The patient also reports intermittent claudication for the past six months  which was previously managed conservatively. No known drug allergies are reported  and he is on metformin and lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension respectively. He denies any fevers  chills  or other systemic symptoms.

The pain is severe  continuous  and seems to worsen at night. Physical examination reveals cool skin  non-healing ulcers on her right foot  and the absence of peripheral pulses in the right leg. She also reports a loss of sensation in the distal part of the right leg and foot. She has a 30-year history of smoking and a past medical history of peripheral artery disease and hyperlipidemia. She currently takes Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Despite optimal medical therapy  she has inspections showing multiple non-healing ulcers at the level of her right foot  indicating advanced peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,18,A 72-year-old African-American male with a known history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with six-week history of recurring rest pain and non-healing wounds on his left foot. He describes the pain as aching and throbbing located in his lower extremity which worsens especially at night and is only relieved by hanging his foot off the edge of the bed. He noticed a small cut on his heel a few weeks back which has now transformed into a deep  non-healing ulcer with purulent discharge. He also reports weight loss  loss of appetite and fatigue for the past month. Cardiovascular history reveals untreated peripheral artery disease. The patient has been a smoker for the past 40 years. He is non-compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications. On examination  his left foot appears to be pale  cold to touch with weak pedal pulses. His left leg displays typical signs of critical limb ischemia including hair loss  shiny skin  and atrophy. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) is requested  with preliminary results showing an index below 0.40 suggestive of severe arterial disease. Specialist referral for further assessment and management is recommended.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,19,A 74-year-old African American male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and a 40-pack year history of smoking presents with critical limb ischemia manifesting as severe rest pain in his right lower limb that worsens at night  causing difficulties with his sleep. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his right lower leg and foot that have been present for the past 2 months. He has lost 15 pounds unintentionally over the past 3 months due to reduced appetite perhaps secondary to pain. He reports intermittent claudication over the last year  with a progressive decrease in the distance he can walk before the onset of pain. The patient also describes a sensation of coldness in his right foot and a palpable absence of the right pedal pulses. He denies chest pain or dyspnea. His last HbA1c was elevated at 8.5% indicating poor glycemic control and his LDL cholesterol levels have been consistently above target despite taking statins. He has not been adhering to his medications due to financial constraints. The severity of the ischemic symptoms suggests a high likelihood of underlying severe peripheral arterial disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,20,A 67-year-old African American male smoker with a significant medical history of uncontrolled diabetes  long-standing hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with increased leg pain  particularly in his right lower extremity. The patient describes this as a steadily worsening relentless pain over the course of the past couple of weeks  also noting that the pain becomes increasingly severe upon slight elevation of the leg. On physical examination  the right leg appears with a pale color  decreased temperature  absent pulse  and several non-healing ulcers on foot. Furthermore  the patient also reports intermittent claudication and has been facing difficulty in walking for the last month. He denies any similar pain in his left leg. He has lost 15 pounds in the last two months due to a decrease in appetite and changes in eating habits as his diabetes became uncontrolled. He also reports a long history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 35 years. The symptoms he exhibits are characteristic of critical limb ischemia  a serious form of peripheral arterial disease  likely complicated by his established risk factors such as smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,21,An 80-year-old Hispanic male patient  formerly a heavy smoker with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes and hypertension presents with rest pain in his left lower extremity  particularly when in bed at night. The pain is described as a deep  burning sensation and is severe enough to wake him up. It has been progressively worsening over the past 3 weeks. The patient also reports a non-healing ulcer over the left great toe that has been present for roughly 4 weeks. Physical examination reveals decreased sensation to touch and temperature in the lower limb  weakly palpable distal pulses and the presence of extensive thickening and scaling of the skin with cyanosis. His left foot is cooler than his right foot. His past medical history includes peripheral artery disease  hyperlipidemia  and he had a myocardial infarction 5 years earlier. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  simvastatin  and aspirin. These symptoms collectively suggest the patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia  likely due to significant occlusive peripheral arterial disease  exacerbated by his medical comorbidities and poor cardiovascular health.

The pain has been severe enough to disturb his sleep and is relieved only by dangling his foot over the side of the bed. Physical examination reveals a cold  pale right foot with diminished pulses  a non-healing 2cm ulcer on the right big toe  and a noticeable loss of hair on the right leg. On pain assessment  he rates his pain an 8 on a scale of 0-10. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. He is currently taking Metformin 1000mg BID  Lisinopril 20mg daily  and a daily aspirin. He lives alone and is retired  with limited mobility due to pain. He admits to a poor diet  largely due to financial constraints. He quit smoking 5 years ago. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,24,"A 70-year-old African American male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents to the emergency room with a 48-hour history of intense  unrelenting pain in his left lower extremity distal to his knee. Prior to this time  he had been experiencing mild  intermittent pain in the same area for several weeks  normally following activity  but it would resolve with rest. The patient describes the leg as feeling """"cold and numb"""" and notes that the color looks bluish. On physical examination  the foot appears pale  is cool to the touch  and the popliteal pulse is absent. He also reports an onset of an ulcer on his heel that is not healing well. The patient is a former smoker with a 40-pack year history but quit 10 years ago. He has never had any similar events in the past. He is on Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. Family history is notable for peripheral artery disease in his father.  He reports that he has been adherent to his medications and has not made any recent changes. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or other limb involvement. He is visually distressed due to the pain. The severity of the symptoms and the findings on physical examination raise a high suspicion for critical limb ischemia."
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,25,A 74-year-old male African-American patient with a 20-year history of type-2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease presents with critical limb ischemia. He has a significant past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia  both being poorly controlled despite past prescriptions for antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. He has a 50 pack-year smoking history  which he quit 2 years ago. For the past two weeks  he has been experiencing continuous  debilitating right foot pain even at rest  coupled with noticeable pallor and coolness to touch. On further inspection  there are non-healing ulcers on his right foot  notably absent peripheral pulses  and disturbed sleep due to the severity of the foot pain. He has lost 15 kilograms of weight over the past six months due to reduced appetite and constant fatigue. He denies any chest pain  dyspnea  or palpitations. This patient's long history of poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral arterial disease  combined with these recent symptoms  suggests a high likelihood of severe peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia.

His family history is significant for paternal vascular disease. Overall  this representation suggests critical limb ischemia due to peripheral artery disease  likely compounded by poorly controlled diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,53,A 67-year-old African American male comes in with a chief complaint of non-healing ulcers on his left foot coupled with severe  burning pain at rest. He reports that the pain sometimes wakes him up from his sleep. He has a history of diabetes for the past 15 years  poorly controlled  and hypertension for about a decade. He is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago but had a 20 pack-year history before that. He also reports intermittent claudication for the past two years but reveals he omitted this symptom from previous encounters due to fear of potential consequences. On examination  his left foot appears pale with noticeable temperature difference compared to the right foot  and its pulses are weak. Multiple non-healing ulcers with surrounding erythema are seen on his great toe and mid-foot areas  with one showing signs of infection. He also has notable hair loss on his left lower leg.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,54,Patient is a 72-year-old African-American male  with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and 40 pack-years cigarette smoking history. He presents with a 3-week history of non-healing ulcer on his left foot. He also complains of severe burning and cramping pain in his left calf  notably worse when walking and at night. There is accompanying rest pain extending up to his left thigh  which is relieved by dangling the leg through the side of the bed  with no relief reported from analgesics. Physical examination reveals reduced temperature in the left foot  significantly diminished pulses in the left lower limb  and a necrotic ulcer situated on the left heel with no signs of infection. No edema or deep vein thrombosis is found. The patient's pain does not allow for an adequate assessment of motor or sensory function in the left foot. The clinical picture is suggestive of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,55,A 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  and a 30-pack-year history of smoking  presents with critical limb ischemia. He reports progressively worsening  severe pain in the right lower leg for the past three days. He describes the pain as constantly present  more pronounced at rest  and not relieved upon elevation of the leg. The patient also reports new non-healing ulcers on the right foot. Physical exam shows weak pedal pulses  pallor  coldness to touch  thinning skin with hair loss  and non-healing ulcers on the right foot.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,56,An 80-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for Type II diabetes  hypertension  and smoking presents with severe pain in his left foot that has worsened over the past few months. The patient indicates the pain is continuous and does not alleviate with rest. He also reports sores that have not healed on the same foot  loss of hair  and shiny skin. Physical examination reveals a cold left foot with delayed capillary refill  non-palpable pulses  and an ulcer on the great toe.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,57,A 72-year-old  obese Hispanic male with a past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a 50 pack-year smoking history presents with progressive worsening of right lower extremity pain over the past month. The pain is aggravated on walking and relieved by rest (claudication). Over the past week  he has noticed new non-healing ulcers on the right ankle and foot accompanied by rest pain that wakes him up at night. He reports a notable decrease in temperature of the right foot compared to the left. He has tried Ibuprofen with minimal relief. Familiar history is significant for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with his father dying from myocardial infarction at age 68 and a brother undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at age 55. Review of systems is negative except for recent unexplained weight loss. He admits to being non-compliant with his diabetes and hypertension medications on occasions and has failed multiple smoking cessation attempts over the past few years. On physical examination  the patient has diminished distal pulses  non-blanchable redness surrounding the right foot ulcer  and mild sensory loss in the right foot. These findings are suggestive of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease  likely exacerbated by his longstanding uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and a significant smoking history.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,58,A 74-year-old African American male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II  smoking  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease  presents with a three-day history of sudden severe pain in his right foot. He also complains of foot color changes  particularly noticing it to be more pale. He admits two separate instances of claudication in this leg in the past few months. The pain has been intensifying  causing him considerable discomfort and pain up to the point of sleep disruption. He is unable to walk without assistance due to the pain. He denies any fevers  chills  but states he has experienced weight loss over the past few months. His physical examination shows diminished pulses in his right foot  pallor  and coolness to the touch. There is a non-healing ulcer present on his great toe. Patient has no known allergies. He is currently on multiple antihypertensives  including amlodipine  and metformin for his diabetes mellitus management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,59,A 67-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with severe left lower leg pain that is worsened by walking and improved with rest for past two weeks. The patient's pain intensifies at night  resulting in him having to hang his leg off the bed for relief. Patient reports experiencing intermittent claudication and painful non-healing ulcers localized on his toes. Physical examination reveals a pale  cold left lower extremity  decreased sensation to touch  and diminished pedal pulses. Resting ankle-brachial index value is 0.4. Patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit 5 years ago. He does not consume alcohol. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. Family history is significant for peripheral artery disease (PAD) in his father.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,60,A 67-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease presents with severe rest pain in his left lower leg  particularly in his foot  for the past week. The pain is constant and has been causing him to lose sleep. He also reports worsening color changes in that foot - now a dusky red color  decreased temperature  and a recently noticed non-healing ulcer on his heel. He also has a 40 pack-year smoking history  although he quit 5 years ago. The patient denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  gastrointestinal symptoms  and any changes in vision or speech. Physical examination of the extremity reveals diminished pulses  shiny and tight skin  hair loss  and a non-pulsatile capillary refill delay in the toes. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,61,A 73-year-old African American male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 30-pack-year smoking  presents with a one-week history of persistent rest pain in his left lower limb. He also complains of non-healing foot ulcers  coldness of the limb  and discoloration. On physical exam  he has diminished peripheral pulses in his left foot  with visible skin changes (dry skin  hair loss)  notable gangrenous patches on his toes  and slow-delayed capillary refill time. Auscultation reveals no distal arterial bruits. He rates his pain 8/10 at rest  worsening at night. His medical history and current symptoms may be indicative of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,62,An 75-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and decades of heavy smoking  presents to the clinic with a 1-month history of progressive severe rest pain in his right lower extremity  worsening ulceration on the dorsal aspect of his right foot  and a noted coldness to the touch. His pain is aggravated by leg elevation and relieved by dependency. He is experiencing associated symptoms of loss of hair growth on the lower extremities  pallor  and muscle atrophy. The lack of healing of the ulcer despite standard wound care is of particular concern. He has a record of non-adherence to diabetic medications and there is no history of recent trauma  however laden with significant risk factors for peripheral artery disease. His symptoms correlate with critical limb ischemia likely due to peripheral artery disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,63,A 70-year-old African-American male with a known medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with critical limb ischemia. He complains of severe rest pain in his right foot that particularly disturbs his sleep. He reports having noticed a non-healing wound on the same foot's big toe four weeks ago. The pain has been progressively worsening for some time now and has become unbearable for the past week. He also mentions that his foot feels unusually cold compared to the other one and appears pale. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,64,An 82-year-old Caucasian female  former smoker with a significant past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presents with a 4-week history of escalating rest pain in her right lower extremity. It has intensified in the last week and she now rates it as an 8/10. She also reports intermittent right foot numbness and the development of discrete  painful non-healing ulcers on her right forefoot. Physical examination reveals decreased sensation in her right foot  decreased distal pulses  and several ulcers on the dorsal aspect of her right foot showing gangrenous changes. The patient is functionally limited by her pain to only a few steps before needing to rest. The scenario is suggestive of critical limb ischemia which is stage III of PAD with a high risk of amputation if not promptly managed.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,65,A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-year cigarette smoking history  now presents with progressive rest pain in his right lower extremity over the last three months. He also reports episodes of non-healing ulcerations in his right foot  aggravated by exercise and partially relieved by hanging his foot over the side of the bed. The pain has worsened over the past week and has kept him from sleep. On physical examination  the foot appears pale with an ulcer on the lateral aspect of the big toe  there is a decrease in distal pulses  and capillary refill time is delayed (>3 seconds). Sensation and strength are preserved  but severely diminished  especially in the distal portions of the limb. He has no similar symptoms in the other lower extremity. No history of angina  myocardial infarction  stroke  or renal disease. This appears to be symptomatic of critical limb ischemia  potentially secondary to his peripheral artery disease exacerbated by his longstanding diabetes and smoking history.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,66,A 68-year-old African American male with a documented history of long standing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia presents with a severe pain in his right lower extremity. He reports intermittent claudication over the past few months  but over the last three days  he complains of persistent rest pain that gets worse at night and disturbs his sleep. Compounding these complaints  he's noted a non-healing ulcer on his right foot that he discovered a week ago. On further assessment  the leg is found to be noticeably cooler with visibly diminished pulses and the uncovered ulcer exhibits signs of gangrenous changes. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking and occasional alcohol consumption. His diet is mostly composed of high cholesterol processed foods  reflecting a lack of awareness of/attention to dietary implications on his condition. He admits to inconsistency in medication adherence and irregular clinic attendance due to limited health literacy and access issues. The overall clinical picture is suggestive of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease. His vascular surgeon immediately identifies the need for revascularization to prevent amputation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,67,An 82-year-old African American female with a known history of diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and chronic kidney disease is presenting with a 3-week history of rest pain in her right leg  specifically in the forefoot  that worsens at nighttime. The pain is severe  depriving her of sleep and could not be relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She also reports a non-healing ulcer on her right big toe. On examination  the right leg appears pale  and the foot is cold to touch with diminished pulse. Physical signs also include loss of hair and dry  scaling skin on the foot. Documented ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) is less than 0.4. This patient's presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,68,A 71-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with increasing pain in his right lower extremity at rest. The pain significantly worsens when his leg is elevated and slightly improves when it is in a dependent position that lasts for more than two weeks. Inquiries about lifestyle reveal that he is a current smoker with a 40-pack year history and rarely engages in any physical activity. He reports intermittent  non-healing sores on his right foot and noticed a decrease in the temperature of his right foot compared to his left. Physical examination shows an absence of right pedal pulses  dry gangrene on his toes  and multiple non-healing ulcers on his right foot. He also mentions occasional episodes of erectile dysfunction and having a pale leg when it is raised during bathing for the past month. His medical history is significant with a 10-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  untreated dyslipidemia  and systemic hypertension. He provides no family history of atherosclerosis or peripheral arterial disease. This suggests critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral arterial disease  possibly related to poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,69,A 76-year-old African American male  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and long-standing  poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by distal symmetric polyneuropathy  presents with a 3-week history of worsening left lower extremity pain. The pain  initially intermittent and aggravated by walking  has progressed to continual discomfort at rest. On physical examination  the left foot appears cooled to touch  with loss of hair growth and shiny skin. Pulses in left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis are not palpable  and an ABI is 0.4 on the left side compared to 0.9 on right side. Furthermore  the patient describes symptoms of intermittent claudication and reports a non-healing ulcer on his left heel. There is no history of coronary artery disease  but he smokes a pack a day for the last 40 years. His medications include metformin  aspirin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with critical limb ischemia.

He reports increased painful sensation  even during periods of rest  which intensifies at night interfering with his sleep. He also added the development of a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. His symptoms are accompanied by the sensation of coldness in the affected limb  noticeable pallor  and marked decreased hair growth on his right leg. His previous medical interventions include Metformin and Aspirin  and he quit smoking five years ago. He is independent in his activities of daily living  although his current symptoms have limited his mobility. He denies any chest pain  breathlessness  dizziness  or loss of consciousness. No similar complaints were noted in the contralateral limb. His family history reveals his father had a stroke in his late 70s. His vitals are stable. On physical examination  weak peripheral pulses were palpated in the right foot with a palpable popliteal pulse and an ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) of 0.6. The described symptoms  history  and physical examination findings raise a strong suspicion of Critical Limb Ischemia  probably due to his underlying Peripheral Arterial Disease. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,73,Mr. X is a 70-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  chronic smoking  and long-standing peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  who presents to the clinic with complaints of rest pain  ulcerations  and discoloration in his right lower extremity. He describes a deep  burning pain in his foot  that is excruciatingly worse at night and only gets slightly better when he dangles his foot off the bed. Concurrently  he also noticed the formation of non-healing ulcers over his right toes with occasional weeping and a purplish discoloration. He denies any history of trauma  similar episodes in the past  or such symptoms in his left lower extremity. His social history is notable for smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years and alcohol consumption within recommended limits.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,74,A 73-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II  chronic hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and 45 pack-years smoking history presents with severe rest pain in his left lower extremity. He describes the pain as aching and persistent even at rest  particularly more intense at night that disrupts his sleep. He reports intermittent non-healing sores on his toes and noticed a blackened area on his big toe recently. On further investigation  he reveals unintentional weight loss  decrease in appetite  and occasional bouts of dizziness. On physical examination  there is evidence of an ulcer on the left big toe with surrounding erythema  and weak left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. No noticeable edema or lymphadenopathy detected. The patient's ABI is calculated to be 0.3 on the left side. His symptoms  history  and physical findings raise a strong clinical suspicion for critical limb ischemia.

The sharp  burning pain  rated 8/10  has been present for the past 3 months but has recently worsened causing him difficulty to sleep at night. Additionally  Mr. Johnson has noticed a discoloration of his right foot and a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. On examination  the foot is cold to touch  pulseless and has a shiny atrophic skin with hair loss. All of these suggest critical limb ischemia associated with peripheral artery disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,76,A 62-year-old African American male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and heavy cigarette smoking  presents with reported severe  constant pain in his right lower leg persisting for the past two weeks. The pain is described as more severe at night and is mildly alleviated when he dangles his leg over the side of the bed. Associated symptoms include nonhealing small wound on his right foot and noted skin color changes in his lower right leg  which are noticeably pale compared to his left leg. No associated fever  trauma  or other systemic symptoms. He has never experienced a similar episode before. Last seen by a healthcare provider a year ago  when they recommended smoking cessation and better control of diabetes  instructions which patient admits he has not fully followed. Family history is significant for peripheral vascular disease in his father. Patient is currently not on any medications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,77,A 70-year-old  African-American male presents with complaints of severe pain in his right lower limb  especially on walking  and persistent sores that are not healing properly. He has a history of 20-year pack-a-day smoking  ongoing poorly controlled diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. His symptoms have progressed over a course of a few months and include difficulty in walking due to the severe pain and gradual onset of rest pain in same leg a few weeks ago. He rates his pain to be a consistent 8/10 on a scale of 0-10. On performing physical examination  we find his right foot cold to touch and could only palpate weak pulses in the right femoral region. No pulses were palpable below the knee. His symptoms are suggestive of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,78,An 80-year-old Caucasian male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic smoking  presents with a one-week duration of increasing  non-healing ulcers on his left lower extremity. He admits to severe pain in the left foot  particularly at rest  and reports occasional numbness in the same limb. He further complains of decreased mobility because of these symptoms  with limited walking distance. On examination  the patient’s left limb is noted to be cooler with diminished pulses compared to the right  with several necrotic ulcers on the left foot. The patient has ankle-brachial index of 0.4 on the left side. There is no evidence of congestive cardiac failure.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,79,A 64-year-old African American male with a 30-year smoking history  a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease  presents with symptoms of critical limb ischemia. Over the past three weeks  he has experienced increasing pain in his right lower limb. The pain worsens dramatically when he lies down and slightly lessens when his legs are in a dependent position. This resting pain is accompanied by sores on his foot of the same leg that do not heal and have progressively worsened. Examination of the foot reveals trophic changes  non-healing ulcers  and areas of tissue necrosis. Pulses in the right leg are not palpable. His challenge with mobility due to escalating pain and limb weakness results in him being wheelchair-bound  and he shares his concerns about potential amputation and dependency.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,80,A 71-year-old African-American male presents with complaints of rest pain in his left lower extremity  particularly at night  for over six weeks. He also shows a non-healing wound on his left foot  near the forefoot. The pain is relieved with dangling of the foot over the side of the bed. Patient has a long history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit 10 years ago. He denies any history of cardiovascular diseases.  On examination  his left lower extremity is cold to touch  the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse are not palpable. Capillary refill time is significantly delayed. There's a trophic ulcer about 2 cm in diameter on his left forefoot with blackened edges. The right lower extremity shows signs of peripheral artery disease but no non-healing ulcers.   This patient most likely presents a case of critical limb ischemia characterized by rest pain  non-healing wounds  and the absence of pulses in the affected limb. His hypertension  diabetes  and previous long-term smoking put him at a higher risk for peripheral artery disease  a precursor to critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,81,Patient is an 82-year-old Hispanic male with a significant history of uncontrolled diabetes type II  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presenting with severe  rest pain in the right lower extremity for the past 7 days. The pain has progressively worsened  affecting his sleep and leaving him barely mobile. Physical examination reveals absent distal pulses in his right foot  and his foot is notably cooler than the left. Mild pallor and cyanosis are observed in the distal foot  with evidence of non-healing ulcers on the right great toe. Apart from the aforementioned  the patient also complains about numbness and tightness in the affected area. The patient is a smoker  with a history of smoking a pack a day for the past 50 years. He has no known allergies and is currently on oral anti-diabetic medication  statins  and anti-hypertensives. Family history reveals heart disease in the father who passed away in his 60's due to a myocardial infarction. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,82,A 66-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II and peripheral artery disease presents with a 2-week history of non-healing ulcers on the left lower extremity combined with debilitating rest pain. He reports that the intensity of the pain has significantly increased in the last 48 hours and prevents him from walking. On examination  the left foot appears pale and cold with diminished pulses  non-healing ulcers at the plantar region  and a blackish discoloration at the tips of the two smallest toes. He is a smoker with a 20-pack year history and works as an office clerk. He denies any history of cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure in his immediate family members.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,83,A 65-year-old African American male with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack-year smoking history  presents with severe rest pain in his right leg that has been increasing in severity over the past month. The patient describes the pain as a burning sensation that especially intensifies during the night and interrupts his sleep. He also mentions not being able to walk for long distances like he used to due to the pain. On physical examination  his right foot is noted to be cold with a diminished pulse. There are also non-healing sores on his right foot and distal leg. The patient registers an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurement of 0.3 on the right side. The patient does not report any similar pain in the left limb.  The patient's symptoms indicate critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease significantly worsened by poor control of his diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and heavy smoking. His African American ethnicity and male gender also places him at higher risk for the disease. Critical limb ischemia is suggested by symptoms of rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and a low ABI measurement.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,84,A 72-year-old African American male  a former smoker with a 20-pack-year history and known medical history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Peripheral Artery Disease  presents with severe rest pain in his right lower limb lasting for the past three weeks. It is most pronounced in the foot and interrupts his sleep. Additionally  he notes a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe that developed 2 weeks ago. Physical exam shows decreased hair growth  shiny skin on the right lower limb  absent pedal pulses  and a shallow ulcer with a necrotic base on the right great toe. The pain intensifies when he elevates the right leg and slightly alleviates when he hangs it down. He denies any trauma  fevers  or chills. He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine with partial compliance due to his limited access to medication refills. The patient’s familial history is significant for his father who had an above-knee amputation due to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to long-standing diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,85,A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a significant medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and 40-pack-year smoking presents to the clinic with non-healing ulcers on his right calf and foot. The patient reports severe pain in his right leg at rest that has progressively worsened over a six-month period. The pain is exacerbated by mild exercise such as walking a short distance and relieved by positioning the limb in a dependent position. On examination  the right foot appears pale when elevated with a noticeable delay in capillary refill and cold to touch. Pulses in the right foot are weak. Doppler ultrasound reveals significantly reduced blood flow in the distal aspects of the right lower limb  consistent with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,86,A 64-year-old African-American male with a significant medical history of heavy smoking  poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presented with a two-week history of severe resting right leg pain and non-healing wounds on his lower extremities. He reports intermittent claudication over the past few months  notably worsening in the past week  limiting his ability to walk more than a block before experiencing pain. Physical examination revealed decreased temperature in the right foot  loss of hair growth on the legs and feet  non-palpable posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses  and non-healing ulcers on the right foot. There is no evidence of foot infection. The pain often awakens him at night and is only minimally relieved by hanging his leg over the side of the bed. He denies any chest pain  difficulty breathing  or loss of consciousness. His resting electrocardiogram and echocardiogram done 3 months ago were within normal limits. This clinical picture is concerning for critical limb ischemia affecting his right leg.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,87,A 67-year-old African American male patient with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and a 30-pack-year smoking history presents with an 8-week history of progressive rest pain in his right lower extremity. This pain has worsened over the past week  reaching an intensity where he is unable to sleep. The patient additionally complains of an associated non-healing ulcer on his right big toe which he first noticed a month ago. The pain is often experienced in his calf and foot  and gets better with leg hanging off the edge of the bed.  He has an ejection fraction of 50%  regular foot examinations had been done in the past with normal findings. His past surgical history is significant for a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. He takes metformin and lisinopril regularly as well as a daily low-dose aspirin. He does not have a history of hyperlipidemia or stroke and does not take any lipid-lowering medication. His family history is unremarkable.   On physical examination  the right foot is noticeably cooler than the left  with sluggish capillary refill. Pedal pulses are not palpable on the right. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) is unrecordable on the right  while left ABI is 1.0. A non-healing  painless  gangrenous ulcer is noted on the right big toe. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,88,A 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  presents to the emergency department with a two week history of worsening pain in his right lower extremity. The patient describes the pain as constant  severe  and worsening at night. He reports that the color of his foot has become progressively more pale and it feels colder than his left foot. He also noticed non-healing sores on his toes. Upon physical exam  his right pedal pulses are not palpable and distal extremity is noted to be cool with signs of mottling. There is significant muscle wasting and multiple non-healing ulcers on the right foot. His left foot appears normal. These symptoms suggest critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,89,An 84-year-old African-American male patient  with known history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and long-standing smoking  presents with complaints of progressively worsening rest pain in the left lower limb for the past two weeks. The pain escalates at night and eases with limb dependency. Further  the patient notes a non-healing ulcer on the left foot since the last three weeks. He also mentions a history of erectile dysfunction. Despite maintaining consistency with anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications  he has found difficulty in managing the escalating pain with over-the-counter pain medication. Physical examination reveals a pale left foot with weak pedal pulses  cold to touch with delayed capillary refill time  and the palpable presence of an ulcer on the dorsum of the foot  approximately 2 cm in diameter and with an irregular margin. The patient has absent hair growth on the legs. His body mass index is within normal limits and vitals show moderate hypertension. Lab results reveal hyperglycemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,90,A 72-year-old Caucasian male patient with a known history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and smoking  presented with complaints of progressive pain in his right lower leg at rest for the past 1 month. The pain had worsened over the past week  and he also noticed sores on his foot that didn't seem to be healing. Physical evaluation revealed an absent popliteal and pedal pulse on the right side. The right foot appeared pale on elevation and dusky red on dependency. The non-healing ulcers were located at the tips of the toes. He reported signs of walking intolerance due to pain and discomfort in the leg on exertion for the past 6 months  progressively worsening over time.  The patient's symptoms and medical history correlate with those commonly observed in patients with critical limb ischemia. The risk factors in this case - diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and the age of the patient - are consistent with those typically seen in literature. His non-healing foot sores  pain at rest  and physical findings are also suggestive of severe peripheral arterial disease leading to critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,91,A 75-year-old African-American male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease presents with severe pain in his right lower leg  rated 8/10  that has been persisting for the past three days. The pain is unrelieved by rest and appears to be worsening. The patient reports that his right foot has turned pale and is cool to touch compared to the left one. He also complains of recent rapid diminishment of his foot sensation. The patient has previously been placed on a regimen of statins  antiplatelets  and ACE inhibitors for management of his medical conditions. He is a former smoker having quit 10 years ago but has a 30-pack-year history of tobacco use. Moreover  the patient has noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. No history of similar episodes  trauma or infection. The patient denies chest pain  cough  dyspnea  or symptoms suggestive of cerebrovascular accidents. Given his medical history and symptomatology  the clinical prediction is consistent with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,92,A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with a three-week history of excruciating pain in his left lower limb  particularly when he walks or stands for long periods. The pain is accompanied by a sensation of coldness in the limb and progressive skin color changes  transitioning from pallor to purple over time. He also reports the occurrence of non-healing ulcers on his foot  noted one week ago. Additionally  the patient mentions a significant weight loss over the past few months. He is a former smoker  quit smoking 2 years ago after smoking for 30 years. He has been on metformin and lisinopril but without adherence to medications. He has a family history of peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular diseases. On examination  the patient's left foot shows areas of tissue necrosis  rest pain and absent pedal pulses  indicative of advanced chronic limb-threatening ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,93,A 65-year-old African-American male  retired dock worker with a 30-year history of smoking  hypertension  and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with a 3-day history of extreme pain in his right lower leg. The pain is scored 8/10 and is constantly present even at rest  significantly impacting his sleep. It's aggravated by elevation and slightly relieved when hanging the leg over the bedside. Over the past day  he felt increasing numbness in his foot and noticed the color of his leg turning pale  and his data show previous history of intermittent claudication. He denies any history of chest pain  palpitations or shortness of breath. On examination  the right foot is visibly paler compared to the left  cold to touch  and decreased dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are noted. The capillary refill time is prolonged. The patient exhibits critical limb ischemia likely secondary to advanced peripheral artery disease  compounded by his diabetes and hypertension. Next steps will involve imaging studies to assess the vascular pathology and consultation for possible revascularization treatment options considering the severity and acuity of his symptoms.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,94,A 68-year-old African American man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and smoking presents with a 2-week history of increasing left foot pain. The pain is initially noticed as intermittent limb pain  triggered by walking  but it has rapidly progressed to a constant  severe  burning pain  which is present even at rest. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his left foot and a noticeably cold foot compared to the right. There is no history of trauma or injury to the foot. The patient's prolonged smoking habits have led to peripheral arterial disease  now complicated with critical limb ischemia. His suboptimal glycemic control is a contributing factor to the poor peripheral circulation and impaired wound healing.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,95,A 68-year-old African American male with a past medical history of long-standing diabetes mellitus type II  chronic kidney disease  and smoking is referred to the hospital with complaints of rest pain in his right lower leg that has progressively worsened over two months. He reports that the pain is exacerbated after a few minutes of walking  causing him to stop  and often awakens him from his sleep. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on the sole of his right foot present for three weeks. The patient has never undergone any surgical interventions previously  takes insulin  metformin  and amlodipine in his daily medications. A review of systems revealed a subjective weight loss over the last month and decreased urination. He has no family history of peripheral artery disease. Currently  he still smokes one pack of cigarettes daily and denies any alcohol or substance abuse. He lives alone  is retired  and encounters issues with ambulation affecting his daily living due to the pain.  Physical examination reveals a thin  chronically ill man with an ulcer (approx. 3 cm in diameter  base appears pale with a distinguishable foul smell) on the sole of the right foot. The right lower limb appears cooler than the left. Both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable weakly compared to the left foot  with notably delayed capillary refill. No murmurs or bruits were detected on cardiovascular examination. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.   This presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia  secondary to peripheral artery disease  likely a consequence of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II  chronic kidney disease  and smoking. The non-healing ulcer indicates the severity of the ischemia. His conditions are further worsened by aggravating factors such as continuous smoking and negatively impact the patient's quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,96,A 74-year-old African American male with a known history of Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and previous transient ischemic attacks  presents with severe  consistent pain at rest in his right lower leg over the past three weeks. The pain is usually worse at night. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his right foot  and a marked decrease in tolerance for walking short distances due to leg pain. On examination  the patient has diminished pulses in the right leg compared to the left  mottled skin  and cold extremities. His right foot's skin is showing signs of gangrene. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia requiring immediate attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,97,A 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and a 40-pack year smoking history  presents with severe pain and numbness in the right lower extremity which has become progressively worse over the past 6 weeks. The pain extends from his hip to his toes  consistently present  significantly worse at night and seemingly unrelieved by over-the-counter medications. Furthermore  he notes a non-healing ulcer on the right big toe with blackish discoloration. He denies any trauma or foreign object insertion. He reports no similar symptoms in his left limb. On physical examination  there are absent popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses with cold skin and impaired sensation in the right lower extremity. A non-healing ulcer with surrounding erythema and blackish discoloration is seen on right big toe. A sensation of decreased hair growth on right lower extremity compared to left was reported. There was a significant delay in capillary refill time over the toes of the right foot.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,98,"An 85-year-old African-American female presents to the hospital with complaints of rest pain in her left lower extremity. She also mentions a non-healing ulcer in her left foot that has been present for a few weeks now. She rates her pain at 8/10  describing it as a constant  """"burning"""" sensation. It tends to get worse when she is resting  particularly at night. She also notes a progressive a change in skin color over her left foot and calf region  becoming more pale-blueish from its usual brown color. She denies any chest pain  dyspnea  or abdominal pain.  Her medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus that has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents for almost 10 years. She also has hypertension and dyslipidemia that are controlled well on statins and an ACE inhibitor. She is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking 20 years back after 30 pack-years of history. She also has a 5-year history of intermittent claudication in both legs managed conservatively.  On physical examination  there is decreased sensation to touch and temperature over the left lower limb  most prominently below the calf. The limb is cold to touch and distal pulses are not palpable.   This is an elderly female with multiple risk factors (including diabetes  tobacco use  dyslipidemia  and hypertension) presenting with rest pain  lower extremity pallor  and impaired wound healing  suggestive of critical limb ischemia."
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,99,A 68-year-old African American male  with a history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  peripheral artery disease  and a one-year history of transient ischemic attacks  presents with severe rest pain in the right lower extremity  extending from the calf to the foot. He describes the pain as burning and usually occurring at night. Further  he indicates that the pain is relieved when he dangles the leg off the side of the bed. He also reports a non-healing ulcer on his right hallux  present for three weeks  progressively increasing in size. On physical examination  the right foot is cold to touch  with noticeable loss of hair  dry and shiny skin  and a necrotic ulcer on the right hallux. Radial pulse and popliteal pulse are present  but dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse are absent in the right limb. His fasting blood sugars are poorly controlled (HbA1c: 9%). There are no complaints of dysphagia  visual blindness  speech disturbances  or facial drooping  which could indicate a cerebrovascular event. There is no history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse. Family history includes a father who died of a stroke at 73 and a mother who died of myocardial infarction at 75. He is unemployed and the caregiver for his bedridden  dementia-affected wife.   This patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI)  primarily due to uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral artery disease  presenting with rest pain and non-healing ulcer. His socioeconomic conditions might be contributing to adherence issues  thereby worsening the underlying medical conditions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,5,100,A 76-year-old African American male with a known medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents broadly with critical limb ischemia. He reports a sequential worsening of persistent rest pain in his left lower limb over the past 4 weeks that extends from his hip to his foot. He admits to experiencing intermittent painful leg cramps at night  which are often relieved by hanging his leg over the side of the bed. He complains of noticeable skin color changes (pale/blue) in his left leg and foot  reduced hair growth  and a non-healing ulcer on the lateral aspect of his foot that appeared 2 weeks ago. Graded exercise stress test indicated limited walking capability due to severe claudication pain in his left calf. Examination revealed reduced pulses in his left foot along with decreased sensation and temperature. These symptoms and clinical findings suggest progressive worsening of peripheral arterial disease  culminating in critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,1,Patient Information:   Name: Mr. Joseph Mathews  Age: 71 years  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer  Non-smoker/non-drinker  Residential Status: Lives alone   Chief Complaint:  Pain in the left leg that intensifies while walking or when resting  also mentioning a increasing number of non-healing ulcers on the same leg.  Past Medical History:   1. Diagnoses - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (11 years ago)  Hypertension (9 years ago)  and Peripheral Arterial Disease (5 years ago). 2. Operations and Hospitalizations - Admitted to the hospital 2 years ago for uncontrolled blood sugar levels.  3. Medications - Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for high blood pressure. 4. Allergies - No known drug allergies. 5. Family History - Father died of myocardial infarction; mother had type 2 diabetes.  Physical Examination:  Pale  pulse-less left foot. Non-healing ulcers on left lower limb. Capillary refill time >3s. Reduced sensation to touch.  Problem Representation:  This is a case of a 71-year-old Caucasian male with a history of type 2 diabetes  peripheral arterial disease  and hypertension. The patient  who is a non-smoker/non-drinker  lives alone. Current complaints include pain in the left leg that amplifies during locomotion or while at rest and non-healing ulcers on the leg. The patient manages his chronic conditions with metformin and lisinopril. The physical examination reveals critical limb ischemia (CLI) symptoms  including a pale  pulse-less foot and delayed capillary refill time. The persistent non-healing ulcers suggest a possible complication due to uncontrolled blood sugar levels indicating his diabetes might not be well managed. The patient could potentially be at a high risk due to his past history and ongoing symptoms. Primary concern would be to manage the CLI and prevent its progression.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,2,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 70 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Location: Rural Midwest  USA Occupation: Retired farmer  Presenting Complaint:  Severe pain in his right leg at rest that has been getting worse over the past few months. He also notes a non-healing sore on his right foot that has gotten progressively worse.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 15 years ago which is currently managed with medication. He has a history of hypertension for 10 years  managed with lifestyle changes and anti-hypertensive medication. He was also diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) about 3 years ago. He had been a smoker for 40 years but quit smoking five years ago.  Physical Exam: On examination  the right foot is cool to touch with reduced pulse. There is a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum of the foot. Capillary refill time is delayed. Mr. Johnson exhibits pain upon elevation of the right foot.  Relevant Family History: His father had a history of coronary artery disease and stroke. His older brother died of myocardial infarction at 72.   Relevant Social History:  Mr. Johnson is widowed and lives alone  with visits from his daughter to help with meals and cleaning. He has been sedentary since retirement. He has a diet high in processed and fast foods.  This patient characterization represents a typical profile for a patient with critical limb ischemia as ages 60-80  male sex  Caucasian race  history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease are all common risk factors according to published literature. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,3,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 70-year-old African-American male who presents with symptoms pertaining to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He is a retired coal worker and has been a smoker for more than 45 years. He is obese  with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2  and has a documented history of heavy alcohol consumption. Further  he lives in a disadvantaged community with significant healthcare disparities.  Medical History: Confirmed history of long-standing  poorly controlled Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. Apart from these  he has a history of dyslipidemia. A documented prior history of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and previous limb arterial intervention is as well noted. In addition  he suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction five years ago and has been having intermittent claudication for the past two years  but has been non-compliant with therapy.  Presenting Problems: The patient presents with rest pain in the left lower extremity for the past three months  controllable with analgesics. Over the past week  he is having severe  unabated pain and has noticed non-healing ulcers and gangrene in the left foot.  Demographic Representation: This representation portrays key demographic factors associated with CLI  including older age  race  socioeconomic factors  smoking  obesity  and heavy alcohol intake. Past medical histories such as poor control of diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  prior PAD  heart diseases  and failure to follow-up regular therapy are common amongst patients with CLI  as documented in medical literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,4,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 72 years  - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired - Marital status: Married - Country of Residence: United States  Presenting Complaint: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the right lower extremity with symptoms of severe resting pain and non-healing ulcer on the right foot.   Clinically Relevant Demographics:   Patient is a male Caucasian  aged above 70  which maps to the demographic (Age > 70 years  male) that carries the highest risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI) as represented in literature.   Past Medical History:   - Systemic hypertension for 10 years  controlled with medications - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  with recent episodes of uncontrolled blood glucose levels - Moderate chronic kidney disease  - Former smoker  quit 5 years ago after smoking for 35 years  Family History:   - Father had coronary artery disease and died of a stroke at the age of 68 - Mother is alive and has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  This patient's demographic profile and past medical history are typical of a patient with critical limb ischemia. Underlying conditions such as systemic hypertension  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and chronic kidney disease are also risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis and consequently Peripheral Artery Disease and CLI. His long history of smoking further amplifies the risk. A family history of cardiovascular disease provides additional predictive value.  Relevant Diagnostic Results:  - Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI): 0.4  - Doppler ultrasound: Decreased blood flow in the right lower limb arteries - Blood Work: Elevated HbA1c  suggesting uncontrolled blood glucose levels  These diagnostic findings align with typical presentation of CLI – notably an ABI lesser than 0.4  indicative of severe ischemia and blood flow reduction as shown by Doppler ultrasound. Furthermore  the elevated HbA1c levels are indicative of poor diabetes control  which may contribute to the progression of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,5,Problem Representation: Patient Description:   The patient is a 70-year-old African American male  a retired dock worker  living with his wife in an urban neighborhood.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient suffers from severe pain in his right leg  especially when moving. He also reports frequent episodes of numbness and a considerable decline in his walking distance over the last six months. There are visible sores on the right foot that are not healing after many weeks.  Demographics and Risk Factors:  Given the age and demographic  as literature often reports a higher prevalence of peripheral artery diseases in African American and older populations. Moreover  his socioeconomic status and work history may have increased his exposure to risk factors.  Past Medical History:  The patient is a smoker with a 50 pack-year history and suffers from earlier diagnosed and treated diseases including Type 2 diabetes  hypertension and high cholesterol. Smoking  diabetes  and hypertension are reported as significant risk factors for Critical Limb Ischemia in literature.  Medication History:  Current medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. The patient also uses Aspirin as an antiplatelet agent regularly.  Family History:  The patient's father died because of a heart attack at the age of 62 and his mother suffered from hypertension.  Considering all the above factors  the patient falls under high risk category for developing Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His condition needs immediate medical attention to prevent further complications and provide a suitable treatment plan.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,6,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Name: Pseudonym chosen to keep anonymity e.g. John Doe  - Age: 73 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Locality: Rural setting  - Occupation: Retired heavy machinery operator  - Marital Status: Married  Presenting Complaint: Severity of pain in right leg worsened over the last 3 weeks with coldness and discoloration.   Past Medical History: - Previous diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Disease(PAD).  - History of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  poorly controlled.  - History of Hypertension  treated with ACE inhibitors. - Past smoker  quit 10 years ago after 40 years of tobacco use.  - Aortic aneurysm repair surgery performed 7 years ago.  - Reported erectile dysfunction and slow-healing sores over the past year.   Family History: - Father died at 72 due to myocardial infarction. - Mother diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension.   Social History: - Has a supportive wife who is his primary caregiver.  - Moderate alcohol consumption (up to 10 standard drinks per week). - Has been living a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.   This profile represents a typical patient suffering from critical limb ischemia based on epidemiological studies. Most patients are elderly males with a history of diabetes and tobacco use. They are generally less active and suffer from concurrent medical conditions like hypertension and atherosclerosis which predispose them to developing ischemia. Rural dwelling is also a common demographic trend  potentially due to less access to healthcare and a higher prevalence of risk factors like smoking and diabetes in such populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,7,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 71 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Residence: Urban Area - Marital Status: Married - Occupation: Retired  Presenting Issue: Patient presents with critical limb ischemia  characterized by persistent resting pain in the right leg for more than two weeks  intermittent claudication  non-healing ulcers on the lower extremity  and noticeable loss of hair on the affected leg.  Demographic Characterization:  Patient fits within the characteristic demographic profile for individuals suffering from critical limb ischemia. Critical limb ischemia predominantly affects individuals above 60 years of age and is more common in males. The incidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which often is a precursor to critical limb ischemia  is higher among Caucasians.  Relevant Past Medical History: Patient has a history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia - all conditions which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease. Patient also has a 45-year history of heavy smoking  which is a critical factor in the development of PAD and subsequent critical limb ischemia.   Also  the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with past myocardial infarction (MI) 5 years ago  which required a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a drug-eluting stent. The presence of CAD indicates the patient's overall systemic atherosclerotic burden  making him more prone to the development of peripheral arterial diseases like critical limb ischemia.   Patient underwent a right femoropopliteal bypass graft 2 years ago  indicating previous critical limb ischemia or severe peripheral arterial disease. Post-procedural stenosis or occlusion of the graft might be responsible for the current state of critical limb ischemia.  Family History: Patient's father suffered from coronary artery disease and his mother was diabetic. Genetic predisposition could be contributing to his overall cardiovascular risk profile.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,8,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 71 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Employment Status: Retired - Living Situation: Lives with spouse  Presenting Problem: The patient reports suffering from pain in the lower extremities  particularly the right leg  even at rest. He complains of non-healing wounds on his foot  accompanied by numbness and coldness in the leg.  Past Medical History: - Known case of diabetes mellitus type II for the last 15 years  managed on Metformin. - History of hypertension diagnosed 11 years ago  effectively controlled on Amlodipine and Lisinopril. - He quit smoking 4 years ago  after a 40-year smoking history (approximately 30 cigarettes/day). - Diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 6 years ago and is currently on Atorvastatin.  - No known allergies to any medications. - No history of surgeries or hospitalizations. - Has no family history of early heart disease or stroke. - Reports he's generally been compliant with his medications and visitations to the doctor for routine check-ups.  Patient Lifestyle: - Patient reports a sedentary lifestyle due to limited mobility as a result of the pain in his leg.  - He is roughly 20 lbs overweight for his height. - Enjoys a diet high in processed foods and carbohydrates.  - Admits to drinking alcohol occasionally.  Given this extensive representation  this patient appears to be at high risk of critical limb ischemia due to his long history of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  along with his prior heavy smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and unhealthy diet. The non-healing wounds on the foot could be due to diabetic foot ulcer  a common issue amongst those with diabetes that can lead to complications such as critical limb ischemia if not adequately managed. His pain and numbness in his leg may be due to peripheral arterial disease  which again is a risk factor for critical limb ischemia. Therefore  the symptoms and past medical history of the patient align well with the typical problems faced by those with critical limb ischemia as per medical literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,9,Patient Profile:   Monique Adams  a 72-year-old African American woman  who has come to the hospital with complaints of severe leg pain  especially when moving. Residing in an urban area. She is retired and lives alone. Her son visits her once a week to provide assistance as she is partially dependent due to her health issues.  Demographic characteristics: - Gender: Female  - Age: 72  - Race: African American  - Residence: Urban area - Socioeconomic and psychological conditions: Retired  living alone  partially dependent on son due to her health ailments  Past medical history:  - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 20 years ago. Despite treatment  her blood sugar level is not well controlled and she also developed diabetic neuropathy. - Hypertension was diagnosed 10 years ago. - Diagnosed with high cholesterol 8 years ago.  - She had a minor stroke around 5 years ago resulting in mild hemiparesis. - Past smoker: She was a heavy smoker until 7 years ago when she quit due to the stroke. - Mild obesity: her BMI is 31. - She has a positive family history of heart disease and stroke.  - Undergone surgery for peripheral artery disease (PAD) 10 years ago; prior to surgery  she had intermittent claudication  Current presentation:  - Monique complains of rest pain which is severe  located in the leg  and worse during physical activities. This pain often wakes her up at night. - She mentioned that her legs are always cold and pale  especially when she elevates them. - Upon physical examination  pulses in the lower limbs were absent  and the skin of lower limbs was a bit shiny with hair loss and evidenced of ulcers that do not heal. - Results of Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test showed a value less than 0.4  indicating severe artery blockage.  This presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia.   Her diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol  history of stroke  and smoking along with family history of cardiac diseases contribute to the atherosclerotic process leading to peripheral artery disease and now possibly critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who has presented to the clinic with symptoms suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a former smoker with a 50-pack-year smoking history. He is retired and lives with his wife.  History of Present Illness: John reports a progressive worsening of fatigue and pain in his lower left leg over the past few months  particularly after physical activities such as walking  but also while at rest. He has also noticed coldness  decreased sensation  and loss of hair on the affected leg  along with a non-healing ulcer on his left foot.  Past Medical History: John has a documented history of diabetes mellitus (25 years)  hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His diabetes has been poorly controlled  with his latest Hemoglobin A1c value at 8.5%. He has also been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 10 years ago. No known allergies.  Family History: Both his parents had cardiovascular disease. His father had coronary artery disease and his mother had a stroke. His brother has diabetes and hypertension  and his sister has hypertension.  Social History: He is a retired factory worker and has quit smoking 15 years ago. He is not a known alcohol or drug user. He remains moderately active in his daily life usually exercising 30 minutes for 3-4 times per week.  The representation of Mr. Smith and his history are synthesized from demographic and medical profile commonly found among CLI patients  as per literature. A high prevalence of CLI is observed among men  particularly elderly  with major risk factors including diabetes mellitus  arteriosclerosis  tobacco smoking  and high blood pressure. PAD is a common comorbidity. CLI typically manifests as progressive pain  coldness  decreased sensation  and presence of non-healing ulcers or sores on the leg/foot. The characterization of his past medical  family  and social history also aligns with those typical of CLI patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,11,Problem Representation:  Mr. J. Rodriguez is a 70-year-old Hispanic male presenting at the emergency department with critical limb ischemia in the left lower extremity. Mr. Rodriguez lives at a rural location with his wife  and he has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years.  Patient's SSN: XXX-XX-XXXX Patient's Insurance: Medicare  Patient Complaint: Acute onset of severe pain in his left lower extremity  Past Medical History:   1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well controlled on Metformin and Humalog. The patient was diagnosed 10 years ago and has maintained an HbA1C less than 7% for the past 5 years.  2. Hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril 10 mg daily since diagnosed 8 years ago.  3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)  Stage III  secondary to long-standing hypertension and diabetes. The patient was diagnosed 2 years ago and is managed with dietary modification.   Family History: The patient's father and two of his siblings have a history of cardiovascular disease before 60 years of age.  Social History: The patient is a retired manual laborer. He denies any illicit drug usage and maintains a moderate drinking habit of 1-2 beers per week. He has been smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 35 years.  Current Medications: Metformin  Humalog  and Lisinopril  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Mr. Rodriguez has been experiencing progressive worsening of his left lower extremity pain over the past 2 weeks. He now reports the pain as 8/10 severity which increases with movement. The pain is associated with non-healing ulcers on the foot and noticeable skin color change (pale). Patient also reports episodes of coldness and numbness in the affected limb.  This problem representation reflects a typical patient with critical limb ischemia  showing the common risks including age  history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and CKD.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,12,Patient Representation:  Mr. Smith is an African American male  75 years of age  from a low socio-economic background. He is a former heavy smoker with a 40 pack-year history but quit smoking 10 years ago. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 29 kg/m2 which categorizes him as overweight.  His medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus (Type 2) - all reasonably controlled with medications (beta-blockers for hypertension  statins for hyperlipidemia  and metformin for diabetes). He also has a history of intermittent claudication and underwent a successful endovascular revascularization of the right leg three years ago.  He has been suffering from rest pain in his left leg for the past five weeks which has substantially increased within the past week. He has developed a non-healing ulcer over the left heel for three weeks. He denies any history of chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  Family history is notable for cardiovascular disease; both his father and elder brother had myocardial infarctions in their early 60s. He has no known drug allergies. He is unmarried  lives alone  and is on a retired disability pension. His diet is predominantly low in fruits  vegetables and high in processed and fast foods due to financial constraints  which contributes to his poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia. He is dependent on his neighbor for his daily chores recently due to the pain.  He consumes alcohol occasionally and has no history of illicit drug use. He admits being non-compliant with his medications and finds it challenging to keep up with his doctor’s appointments due to lack of social and family support and transportation difficulties.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,13,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 70-year-old African American male with a history of consuming tobacco presents with complaints of persistent leg pain  even at rest  and non-healing sores on his lower left foot.  Demographics: Age: Elderly people  particularly over the age of 70  are at an increased risk of developing critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Race: African-Americans are more likely to develop peripheral artery disease  which is a risk factor for CLI  than non-Hispanic whites. Gender: Men are slightly more likely to develop CLI than women. Habits: People who smoke or have a history of consuming tobacco are at a significantly increased risk of developing CLI.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type-2 diabetes and is being treated for hypertension. He also had a myocardial infarction two years ago.  Diabetes: Diabetes is a significant risk factor for CLI due to its effects on the blood vessels  especially for patients with poor disease control. The patient's lower left foot sores  which are not healing  could be due to diabetic neuropathy.  Hypertension: Chronic hypertension can cause damage to blood vessels and hinder the blood flow  contributing to the development of CLI.  Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's previous myocardial infarction indicates an underlying cardiovascular disease  which strongly associates with the risk of development and progression of CLI.   In summary  as a 70-year-old African American male smoker with diabetes  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease  this patient presents numerous risk factors associated with critical limb ischemia. His current symptoms of leg pain and non-healing foot sores are indicative of the same.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,14,Problem Representation:   Patient Demographic Information: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with severe  continuous leg pain in the right lower extremity  which has been progressively intensifying over the past two weeks. The pain is worse at night and slightly alleviated when the leg is kept in a dependent position. The patient also complains of non-healing ulcers on the distal part of the right lower extremity.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of type-2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  which are being managed with Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin respectively. The patient also has a 30-pack year smoking history. There have been no previous vascular interventions on the leg. The patient has a history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and underwent a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) 3 years ago. No known history of malignancy or known allergies to any medications.   Social History: The patient is a retired machinist. He lives alone in a single-floor home. He has a daughter who visits him occasionally. He has been a smoker for the past 35 years and consumes alcohol socially. He has a poor dietary habit with a preference for high carbohydrate and high cholesterol foods.  Relevant Family History: The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68  and his older brother underwent a vascular bypass for peripheral artery disease.  Problem List:  1- Right lower extremity critical limb ischemia (CLI) 2- Non-healing ulcers due to CLI  3- History of type-2 diabetes mellitus  4- History of hypertension  5- History of hyperlipidemia  6- Smoking habit  7- Poor diet  8- Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) post-PCI   This problem representation draws on literature findings that show CLI patients are often older adults with comorbid conditions  including diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Smoking is a significant risk factor  and African Americans are disproportionately affected. These medical and social factors combine to portray a patient with significant vascular insufficiency  leading to CLI.  References:  1- Norgren L  Hiatt WR  Dormandy JA  et.al.

This patient's demographic representation  as a senior Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  diabetes  peripheral artery disease  and smoking  observed in urban areas  matches the typical demographic profile of critical limb ischemia patients found in literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,16,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old African American man from an urban neighborhood who presents to the clinic with rest pain in the right lower extremity and non-healing ulcers on his right foot. He indicates that he has been experiencing numbness and a cold sensation in his limb. He has difficulty walking even for short distances and has significantly changed his lifestyle due to this condition.  Relevant Medical History: Mr. Jones has a significant medical history. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago  which has been managed inconsistently throughout the years. He has a 40-year pack-a-day smoking history and was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol 10 years back. He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction (heart attack) five years ago and underwent an angioplasty procedure. He suffers from obesity with a BMI of 32. He has a family history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Patient Lifestyle: Mr. Jones is a retired truck driver and continues to live a sedentary lifestyle. His diet mainly consists of fast food. He has tried multiple times to quit smoking but keeps reverting back due to stress.  Representation as per Literature: Gender  advanced age  African American race  history of diabetes  smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  previous heart disease  obesity  family history of PAD and a sedentary lifestyle constitute factors identified in the literature  contributing to critical limb ischemia. Besides  socio-economic factors such as living in an urban neighborhood and stress contribute to the persistence of unhealthy habits like smoking and poor dietary choices. This particular representation therefore  accurately fits into our demographic and clinical profile from the literature for a typical patient with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,17,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Patient Identification Number(PIN): ##### - Name: XXXX - Age: 70 years - Gender: Male - Race/Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Retired - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle  previous smoker  occasional alcohol consumption  Medical History: - Cardiovascular history: Long standing history of hypertension - Endocrine history: Uncontrolled type II diabetes for the past 10 years - Nephrology history: Stages 2 Chronic Kidney Disease - Vascular history: Diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 5 years ago  Presenting Concerns: - Primary Issue: Complaint of rest pain in the lower extremities  especially noticed in the right foot. Intense pain particularly worse at night. - Duration: Pain has been progressing over the last two months but has significantly worsened in the last week. - Complications: Non-healing ulcers on the right foot for the past 3 weeks and noticeable skin discolouration.  Physical Examination: - Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI): 0.40 - Pulse: Absent foot pulses bilaterally  weakened popliteal pulse  preserved femoral pulses - Skin: Atrophic skin changes with hair loss  apparent discoloration  non-healing ulcer on the right foot - Sensation: Altered sensation with diminution of sensation to a pinprick and light touch  particularly from mid-calf distally  Lab Tests/Diagnostic Procedures: - Serum Creatinine: Elevated  - Hemoglobin A1c: Elevated - Fasting blood sugar: Elevated - Lipid Profile: LDL cholesterol  triglycerides elevated - Angiography: To visualize the occlusion/disturbance in the blood flow  This is a representative picture of a typical elderly male patient with critical limb ischemia most commonly associated with uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral artery disease. This demographic and comorbid conditions were derived as per relevant literature. The patient's pain  non-healing ulcers  diminished pedal pulses and low ABI clearly points towards critical limb ischemia. This case will require careful prognosis  considering the patient's age  chronic conditions  and the severity of the ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,18,Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  named John Smith  with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a former smoker  with a 40-year-smoking history of one pack of cigarettes per day  but quit 10 years ago. He is retired and lives with his wife in the urban Midwest of the United States.  Complainting Symptom: Mr. Smith has presented with a two-week history of worsening pain in his right foot  even when at rest. The pain is localized at the toes and worsens during sleep. He also reports a recent non-healing ulcer in the same foot.  Medical History: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and takes regular medication to manage his blood glucose levels. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 8 years ago and has been on medication for both.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  there is noticeable pallor on elevation of the right foot  dystrophic toenails  absence of hair  coldness of the foot  diminished pulse in the right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Ulcer noted on the plantar surface of the right foot  with black necrotic tissue at the edge. There is also reduced sensitivity in the foot  as determined through a monofilament test.  This problem representation is typical for a patient with critical limb ischemia  given the common risk factors of older age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and most importantly  diabetes. These represent the most significant risk factors for peripheral arterial disease  which often leads to critical limb ischemia. The presence of rest pain and non-healing ulcers are among the symptoms leading to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia  which would need to be confirmed through further diagnostic testing.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,19,Patient Representation:  Name: John Doe  Age: 70 years   Gender: Sex represents a significant risk factor for critical limb ischemia  and males have a higher prevalence rate than females. Therefore  this case envisions a male patient. Race: Caucasian (vascular disease more common in this race) Residential Location: Urban area with high pollution rate   Occupation: Retired construction worker    Social History: Smoker for 30 years    Medical History (Risk Factors & Comorbid Conditions):  1. Diabetes: Diabetes Mellitus type 2 for 10 years. (Most patients with critical limb ischemia have peripheral artery disease  and diabetes is a major risk factor for developing this disease) 2. Hypertension: Suffering from hypertension for the past 15 years. 3. Hyperlipidemia: Has a history of high cholesterol. 4. History of heart disease: Had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. (Cardiovascular diseases are another common risk factor for these patients) 5. Obesity: Obesity is another risk factor for limb ischemia. 6. Sedentary Lifestyle: For most of his life  his job required minimum physical activity resulting in a sedentary lifestyle. 7. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): 8. Previous history of intermittent claudication: Intermittent claudication is associated with peripheral artery disease  often preceding limb ischemia.  Presenting Symptoms:  Severe pain in the right leg while resting. The pain often increases during the night  causing difficulty in sleeping. Non-healing ulcers/gangrene on toes and foot. The foot often feels cold to touch.   *Disclaimer: The numbers mentioned are as per the literature available and may not always apply to real-life scenarios. They are mentioned to create a representative scenario for a case of critical limb ischemia. Real-life patient data could vary.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,20,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 70 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanic Residence: Urban area with moderate air pollution   Medical History:  John Doe has a complicated medical history. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago  which he managed initially with oral hypoglycemic agents. Progression of the condition meant he was switched to insulin 5 years ago. His HbA1c levels have been poorly controlled for the last few years due to erratic food intake and missed insulin doses. Approximately five years ago  he was also diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). Despite adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications such as nicotine cessation and regular walking exercise alongside drug therapy (statin  ACE inhibitor  and antiplatelet therapy)  his PAD symptoms have worsened.    Additionally  he has a 40 pack-year history of smoking  although he quit 5 years ago when diagnosed with PAD. He also consumed alcohol moderately until cessation five years ago. He has a familial history of cardiovascular disease  with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.   John has Hypertension  controlled with an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide diuretic  and Hyperlipidemia  which he manages with atorvastatin. He has also undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) 10 years ago because of severe left main disease and Triple Vessel Disease (TVD).  Presenting Complaint:  John presents with increased pain in his lower limbs  particularly in his left leg  even at rest. He has noted that the leg has become increasingly cold over the past few weeks and has noticed a color change to a pale and sometimes bluish color. He also mentions the presence of non-healing sores specifically at his left foot's heel and under the big toe.  This problem representation establishes that John Doe is a typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia  accounting for demographic characteristics and significant risk factors found in the literature  such as advanced age  male gender  diabetes  peripheral arterial disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of coronary artery disease  history of smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease. His symptoms of resting pain  temperature change  color change  and presence of ulcers are indicative of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,21,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 73 years old Sex: Male   Race: Caucasian Geography: Urban dwelling  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with chronic severe pain in the right lower limb  even at rest  which has been progressively worsening over the past few months. The pain is worse at night and makes it difficult for him to sleep. He has noticed some non-healing wounds on the same foot and has been experiencing significant weight loss.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Smoking: John has a 40 pack-year smoking history and continues to smoke. 2. Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed with Type II diabetes 12 years ago. 3. Hypertension: He has a long-standing history of high blood pressure. 4. Previous peripheral vascular disease: John underwent angioplasty on the left lower limb 3 years ago. 5. Hyperlipidemia: He is under treatment for high cholesterol levels. 6. Chronic Kidney Disease: He has a known history of chronic kidney disease (stage III). 7. History of Ischemic Heart Disease: He suffered a myocardial infarction 7 years ago and had coronary artery bypass surgery subsequently. 8. Sedentary lifestyle: He has been retired for 8 years and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  This clinical presentation and patient's past medical history  dominated by a significant burden of cardiovascular risk factors  suggest the patient is likely suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). CLI  a severe form of Peripheral Arterial Disease  is characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers or gangrene in the affected limb due to atherosclerosis  commonly associated with patients over 70  smokers  diabetic  hypertensive and hyperlipidemia patients  and with a sedentary lifestyle.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,22,Problem Representation:  Demographics: - Gender: Male - Age: 78 years old - Race/ethnicity: Caucasian  no known ancestry of clotting disorders - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol - Home environment: Lives alone with assistance from home care services.  Chief Complaint: Patient presents with rest pain in the right lower extremity  especially at night.   History of Present Illness: The patient has reported intermittent claudication (pain during physical activity) over the past several months  with an escalating frequency in the past two weeks. The patient also notices that his right foot is often cold and has mentioned a color change (pale to bluish) in the foot and toes.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed five years ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago. Patient has been on medication and following diet control as advised for diabetes.   Past Surgical history: Underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 6 years ago due to severe coronary artery disease.  Family History: Both father and older sibling passed away due to heart-related illnesses. Mother had hypertension.  Physical Examination: Examination reveals decreased pulse in right foot  pallor on elevation  dependent rubor  and non-healing ulcers on the foot. Patient also found to have loss of hair on the leg and foot  delayed capillary refill  and distal muscle atrophy.  Relevant Tests/Lab Findings: - Ankle-brachial index (ABI): < 0.40 Right foot (indicating severe PAD) - Blood glucose levels: Above normal range  indicating poor diabetes control  Diagnosis: Critical Limb Ischemia  Treatment Plan: Multidisciplinary treatment approach – optimizing diabetes control  cardiovascular risk factors modification  possible revascularization surgery depending on angiographic findings  pain management  wound care and rehabilitation.  Disclaimer: This is a hypothetical representation and does not represent any individual patient’s medical condition or history. Always consult with a medical professional for health advice.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,23,Problem Representation  1) Patient Representation: A 72-years old  African American  female patient presents with complaints of severe and constant pain in her left lower extremity  right up to her hip  even during rest. The pain intensifies upon physical activities or during cold weather. There is also a report of non-healing ulcers over the left foot present for the past month. The patient also complains of numbness in the left lower limb.  2) Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a self-reported history of long-standing Type 2 diabetes mellitus  inadequate physical activity  and smokes a pack a day for the past thirty years. She has a high cholesterol level and has been diagnosed and treated for hypertension for ten years. One year ago  she was treated for a cardiac issue but refuses to elaborate further.  3) Problem Representation:  a) The patient's constant  intensely severe pain in the leg which gets exacerbated by cold weather or physical activity suggests probable limb ischemia. The Non-healing ulcers on the foot also point towards peripheral tissue necrosis due to ischemia. b) Risk factors like age  African American race  female sex  smoking history  and the presence of comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia make her highly susceptible to peripheral artery disease (PAD)  making limb ischemia a critical concern. c) The aforementioned cardiac issue indicates existing cardiovascular disease  increasing the likelihood of concurrent PAD.  Problem representation warrants immediate attention to this case of severe limb ischemia. The goal is to restore the blood flow to her limbs before the condition progresses to tissue necrosis and gangrene  frequently requiring amputation. This representation also necessitates aggressive management of her co-morbidities to prevent further vascular complications.  Note: Critical limb ischemia occurs frequently in patients over the age of 70 and in patients with a history of smoking  diabetes and high cholesterol (Hirsch et al.  2001). African Americans and  to some extent  females are also more likely to suffer from PAD (Fowkes et al.  2013). This demographic characterization is representative of a typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia  as found in the literature. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,24,Problem Representation:  Patient Overview:  Patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  a retired banker  currently living as per his socio-economic status. He is an ex-smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history and has been abstinent for approximately 10 years. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 28  indicating he is overweight.  Demographic Characterization: In terms of race and age  the patient falls within the typical demographic for critical limb ischemia  as the condition is prevalent among older Caucasian adults  especially men. The patient has a past history of heavy smoking.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled type II diabetes for the past 20 years  poorly controlled hypertension for 10 years  and severe peripheral vascular disease diagnosed 5 years ago. He also suffers from chronic kidney disease stage 3. The patient had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 7 years ago for intractable angina.  Current Presentation: Presently  the patient reports experiencing intense pain in right lower limb at rest that disrupts sleep and is only partially relieved by opioids. On physical examination  there is significant muscle atrophy of right leg  with pallor  cold to touch  loss of hair  and non-palpable popliteal and foot pulses. The patient admits to significant weight loss and reduced oral intake due to loss of appetite. His blood pressure and A1C levels are not within target ranges.   Given the patient's age  history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  coronary artery disease  and peripheral vascular disease  these factors collectively indicate the patient is at a high risk for critical limb ischemia. His severe pain at rest and physical examination findings suggestive of severe vascular compromise support the diagnosis. His symptoms of weight loss  lack of appetite and uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes may complicate his overall management and require immediate attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,25,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male who resides in a suburban area. He is a retiree from a labor-intensive job  with a past medical history significant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension. He has a 20-year history of smoking but quit approximately 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use.   Presenting Problem: The patient has been experiencing increasing discomfort in his left leg over the past several months. The pain initially appeared after walking certain distances but has recently became constant. He also describes rest pain  particularly at night  which sometimes awakens him from sleep. The patient reports non-healing sores on his left foot that have appeared within the last three weeks and has noticed a decrease in the temperature of his left lower limb.  Possible Diagnosis:  The patient’s symptoms suggest he may be suffering from Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) that has progressed to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for obesity  poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. He has also previously been diagnosed with coronary artery disease for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention five years ago.  Family History:  The patient’s father and oldest brother both died from complications of myocardial infarctions in their late 50s. His mother is alive and has a history of stroke. He also has two other siblings who are both alive and have a history of hypertension.  Medications: The patient takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily for diabetes  as well as lisinopril 20 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily for hypertension and dyslipidemia  respectively. He also takes aspirin 81 mg daily as secondary prevention for his pre-existing coronary artery disease.  Conclusion: Based on the demographic prevalence and patient history  it is highly likely that the patient’s present symptoms are due to PAD progressing to CLI. Urgent evaluation and management are necessary due to the high risk of limb loss and other severe complications in patients with CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,26,Patient Description: 75 year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia. The patient lives in a suburban area and is a retired mechanical engineer.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient presents with rest pain of increasing severity in the right lower leg that has been progressively worsening over the past few months. Patient describes the discomfort as a burning sharp pain  worst at nights affecting his sleep and requiring opioid pain medication for relief. In addition  on examination  patient had non-healing ulcers on the right medial calf and foot with associated skin discoloration (pale skin) and reduced temperature in his right lower limb. He also reports reduced ability to walk short distances  which was not a problem 6 months ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia  which are common in the majority of people with critical limb ischemia. He is currently managing these conditions with metformin  lisinopril  and statin therapy respectively. There is no past surgical history but he was a 20-pack year smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago.   Family History:   Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease – both his father and older brother had myocardial infarctions in their 70s.  Allergies: He has no known drug or food allergies.   Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  Aspirin.   Social History: The patient is retired  lives with his wife  and has two children who live out of state. Patient has good support system from his children and friends. He quit smoking about 10 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol and is largely sedentary.   Assessment: The elderly age group  the history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  dyslipidemia along with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease  and patient's previous smoking habit increase the patient’s risk of developing critical limb ischemia  as reported in literature. His present symptoms of lower limb rest pain  non-healing sores  discoloration  and cooler temperature in the affected limb further suggest the possibility of severe peripheral arterial disease that has lead to critical limb ischemia.   Plan: Further diagnostic investigation with Doppler ultrasound  angiogram  and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) to confirm diagnosis and assess severity. Treatment plan would likely involve revascularization procedures (surgical or endovascular)  aggressive risk factor management  pain control  and wound care. Patient likely to be referred to vascular surgeon for specialized care.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,28,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Smith Age: 72 years  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Residence: Urban locality   Presenting complaint: Severe pain in the right lower leg that worsens on walking (Claudication) and at rest  especially at night. He also reports discoloration and coldness of his right foot for the past two weeks.  Past medical history: - Hypertension  managed with Amlodipine 5mg daily for the past 10 years. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with Metformin 500mg twice daily for the past 8 years. - History of smoking around 25 cigarettes daily for the last 50 years.  Family history:  - Father had coronary artery disease leading to a heart attack at 68 years. - Brother is currently under treatment for peripheral artery disease.   Clinical history: - The patient's hypertension and diabetes are well controlled with medication. - He denies any history of chest pain or myocardial infarction.  - He has been unsuccessful with tobacco cessation efforts in the past.  Physical examination: - Pulse in the right lower limb is weak. - The color of the right foot is bluish. - Skin over his right foot is cold and there are trophic changes in the form of thin  shiny skin and hair loss. - There is no ulceration or gangrene noted.  Diagnostic tests suggested: - Duplex ultrasound - CT Angiography - Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test - Blood tests including HbA1c  This problem representation represents a likely case of critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries that drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin changes. The patient's age  prolonged history of smoking  presence of diabetes mellitus  and hypertension are common risk factors associated with the disease as per existing literature. The diagnostic tests aim to confirm the diagnosis  understand the extent of arterial blockage  and manage the comorbidities appropriately.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,29,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Ms. Iva  a 75-year-old African American female  presents to the clinic with complaints of severe pain in her right foot especially at rest  which escalates during the night. She also mentions a noticeable change in the color of that foot compared to her left one  appearing paler.   Past Medical History: Her medical history reveals long-standing Type II Diabetes Mellitus  poorly controlled with medications  and she has been a 1-pack per day smoker for the last 30 years. In addition  she has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for 10 years  and a past history of coronary artery disease with one coronary artery bypass graft surgery performed 2 years ago. Ms. Iva has not noted any healing complications with her surgical wound; however  she has had previous history of non-healing ulcers on her right foot.   Family History: There is a significant family history of peripheral artery disease on her maternal side  with her mother and three aunts suffering from the disease.  Lifestyle: She lives alone in a two-floor house with a pair of staircases. She is barely able to move around her home due to significant lower limb weakness and the pain in her foot.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  her right foot is noticeably cooler and has a weak or non-palpable pulse. She has atrophic skin changes  brittleness of nails  and has a non-healing ulcer on the medial side of her right foot. A noticeable decrease in hair growth on her right lower extremity compared to the left one is observed. Distinctive pain on elevation and relief on dependency are also notable.  Considerations: Given Ms. Iva's background of smoking  diabetes  and coronary artery disease along with her symptoms and physical examination findings  there is a high probability of her suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  which requires immediate attention and intervention. Due to Ms. Iva’s age and ethnicity  she is at higher risk  as evidence suggests that CLI is more prevalent among the aged and Black populations. Her smoking history further exacerbates her risk. Her diabetes  if not taken care of properly  could have accelerated the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries of her lower limb leading to CLI. The above profile attempts to represent a typical CLI patient based on literature evidence.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,31,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. John Smith  is brought in by his son complaining of severe rest pain in his left leg which has been progressively worsening over the last few weeks. The pain particularly increases when he's lying down and finds some relief when he hangs his leg over the side of the bed. He was a chronic smoker with a history of 50 pack-years but has quit smoking for the past 15 years or so. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his BMI is around 29  indicating he is overweight.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a notable history of medical conditions such as Type II diabetes mellitus which he has been managing with oral hypoglycemics for the past 11 years. He also has hypertension which has been under control with medication. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease 5 years ago and was managed with stents. He has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases; his father had myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his mother had a stroke in her late sixties.   For the past two years  Mr. Smith has been regularly seeing his primary care provider for symptoms of claudication in his left leg  indicative of peripheral artery disease. He couldn't walk more than a few blocks without experiencing pain  managed by resting for a while. His left leg looks shady  thin  and shiny with sparse hair  and noticeably colder in comparison with the right leg.  Relevance: Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the most severe form of peripheral artery disease  is more common among the elderly  smokers  diabetics  hypertensives and those with coronary artery diseases. The demographic characteristics of Mr. Smith including his age  past history of smoking  presence of co-morbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and coronary artery disease  as well as symptoms of worsening leg pain  indicate towards a strong possibility of CLI. Early diagnosis and management are essential to prevent limb-threatening consequences.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,32,"Problem Representation  Patient Profile:  - Age: 72 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  - Residential area: Urban - Marital Status: Married - BMI: 28 (Overweight)  Presenting complaints:  The patient presents with persistent pain in his left lower limb  notably in his foot and calf. The pain worsens when he is lying down and it seems to ease a bit when he lets his leg hang down from the bed. He also complains of sores on his left foot that are not healing and has noticed some dark discoloration. On enquiry  the patient states that he has been experiencing intermittent claudication in his left leg for the past few months and noticed a decrease in the temperature of his left foot compared to his right foot. He also states that the pain has become so severe that it has disrupted his sleep.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago. Has been a smoker for around 45 years  with an average of 20 cigarettes per day (he quit smoking 2 years ago). Diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 7 years ago. Underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease 4 years ago. History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2 years ago. No known allergies.  Current Medications:  Metformin 500mg twice daily Lisinopril 10mg daily Simvastatin 20mg daily Aspirin 81mg daily  Family History:  Father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  Social History:  Retired banker  lives with wife. The patient has 2 adult children who live out of town. Used to smoke  but quit. Drinks alcohol occasionally.  Review of Systems:  Denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  abdominal pain  changes in bowel or bladder habits  or changes in weight. He does report difficulty walking due to leg pain.  This problem representation was created based on the typical patient population suffering from critical limb ischemia  as shown in available medical literature. It's majorly found in older men who have a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,33,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male  married  with three adult children  and retired from a manual labor job. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history but quit 10 years ago. He is a vegetarian and leads a moderately active lifestyle post-retirement.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with rest pain in the right lower extremity  particularly at night  and non-healing ulcers on the foot and ankle  indicative of critical limb ischemia.  Patient History: The patient has a documented history of several comorbidities including hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which has been controlled with metformin for the last 10 years. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia and peripheral artery disease  with a successful angioplasty performed on the left lower limb 5 years ago. Furthermore  he has a familial background of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away following a heart attack at the age of 65.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the right lower extremity is noticeably cooler than the left. Pulses in the right foot are impalpable. Examination of the foot reveals two non-healing ulcers  one on the heel and the other on the lateral border of the foot  both with mild erythema surrounding the wounds.  Lab Tests: CBC  BMP  lipid profile  and HbA1c are pending. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test would also be useful in determining the severity of the disease.  Possible Treatments:  The patient's condition may require endovascular treatment or bypass surgery in addition to aggressive management of his comorbidities (hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia) and risk factors (smoking cessation  diet  exercise).   The demographic representation is based on research indicating that critical limb ischemia is more common in the elderly  among African Americans  and in individuals with a history of smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease (J Vasc Surg. 2017 Jul; 66(1): 227–234).
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,34,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Male - Age: 62 years old - Ethnicity: White/Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Lifestyle: Sedentary  former smoker (quit 5 years ago after being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes) - Residential Area: Urban  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Onset and Diagnosis of Type II Diabetes: Diagnosed with Type II Diabetes 5 years ago has been on Metformin (500mg twice daily) ever since. He has shown an inconsistency in maintaining a disciplined diet and regular physical activity.  2. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): His medical records reveal that he has been suffering from PAD for the last two years. He underwent angioplasty for one occlusion in the right leg a year and a half back. Currently  on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75 mg) for PAD.  3. Hypertension: Diagnosed with hypertension concurrent with the onset of diabetes  and is on Lisinopril (20 mg daily).  4. Hyperlipidemia: Has high cholesterol levels managed with Atorvastatin (40 mg daily).  5. Previous Smoking History: Regular smoker for 35 years (1 pack/day)  quit after being diagnosed with diabetes.  Presenting Complaints:  1. Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI): Patient presents with rest pain in both legs  ulcerations on the tips of toes on the right leg  and a non-healing wound around the ankle. The symptoms worsen while sleeping or when the legs are at the heart level  forcing the patient to dangle his legs for relief.  2. Ankle-brachial Index(ABI): The patient's ABI is 0.4  indicative of severe PAD.  This problem representation for critical limb ischemia covers standard risk factors including diabetes  peripheral arterial disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous smoking history. These conditions and lifestyle factors are all associated with a higher risk of CLI in the medical literature. Demographically  the patient is an older  Caucasian male  matching statistical trends indicating this population as the most affected by CLI. His living conditions and profession are also taken into account.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,35,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 70 years old  - Sex: Male - Race/ Ethnicity: White - Occupation: Retired Electrician - Residential Status: Lives alone  in urban setting - Smoking Status: Has a history of smoking for the last 40 years - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate alcohol consumption  Presenting Complaint: - Severe pain in lower extremities  recently increased in intensity   Past Medical History: - Type II Diabetes Mellitus - Coronary artery disease - Hypertension - High cholesterol levels - History of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  Other Relevant Information: - The patient has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases. - Last recorded BMI was 28 (overweight). - Patient has been on medications for diabetes and hypertension. - Previous medical records indicate intermittent claudication during the last year. - The patient had angioplasty of the left coronary artery 5 years ago. - Patient is not consistent with his medications and often forgets to take them. - Reports of experiencing coldness in the feet and loss of hair on the toes and lower parts of the legs.  Note: Consistent with the literature  the patient is of an age group (70 years old) highly at risk for critical limb ischemia  has a relevant history of vascular disorders particularly peripheral artery disease  and diabetes mellitus. Also  he is a long term smoker which is associated with the advanced peripheral artery disease leading to critical limb ischemia. The patient is also male  and literature often suggests a higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease and critical limb ischemia in males compared to females. His reported symptoms align with the potential onset of critical limb ischemia.

Recently  the pain started to present even at rest  especially at night. Also  he has noticed that his right foot generally feels colder than the left one.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 8 years ago  currently on Lisinopril 2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Diagnosed 6 years ago  taking Metformin  3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 3 years ago  currently on Atorvastatin 4. History of coronary artery disease  underwent angioplasty 5 years ago 5. Former smoker  quit 3 years ago after 35 years of smoking  Social History: Mr. X is a widower living with his son's family. He is retired and spends most of his time indoors reading or watching TV. He quit smoking three years ago and does not consume alcohol. He has a predominantly sedentary lifestyle.  Family History: His father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 64. His mother is alive and well at 88 years old  with a history of hypertension and type II diabetes. His brother had a stroke at the age of 65.  Physical Examination Findings: Mr. X's right lower leg was noticeably cooler and paler than his left leg. Also  the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were absent on the right side. On observation  he also presented non-healing ulcers on the toes of his right foot.  Problem Representation: A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a significant history of hypertension  type II diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease  presents with critical limb ischemia characterized by rest pain  palpable coldness in the limb  and non-healing ulcers. His primary risk factors include a sedentary lifestyle  smoking history and a family history of cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,37,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Sex: Male Age: 71 years old Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Married Occupation: Retired teacher Place of residence: Urban area in Michigan  USA  Presenting Complaint: Severe pain in the right leg  extreme discomfort while walking  and dark spots on the leg.  Patient History:   Present history: Symptoms have developed over the few past months  gradually increasing in intensity. The patient states the pain becomes significantly worse while walking  enough to make him stop after a short distance. The pain is relieved with rest. Recently  he has noticed the appearance of sores that do not heal and the skin on his right foot has started to turn dark.  Medical history: The patient suffered from a heart attack five years ago. He has been a hypertensive and dyslipidemic for 10 years and has been on medication (anti-hypertensives and statins). He was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 8 years ago  for which he is under medication.  Medication history: Anti-hypertensives  statins  and oral hypoglycemics.  Social history: 20 pack years smoker but quit 5 years ago. Denies illicit drug use. Enjoys a glass of whiskey occasionally. Sedentary lifestyle.  Family history: His father passed away from a heart attack; his elder sister and mother have diabetes and high blood pressure  respectively.  Given the demographic  presenting issues  and medical history  it seems probable that the patient is suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia  a peripheral arterial disease.  This problem representation follows the typical demographic characteristics and risk factors found in literature for Critical Limb Ischemia; a majority of patients are elderly (average age of 70 years)  male  and often have comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of tobacco usage. The disease is more common in Caucasian and non-Hispanic populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,38,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  Demographics: High prevalence of critical limb ischemia (CLI) has been reported in males and the elderly  hence this profile. Being Caucasian is also representative since the incidence and prevalence of PAD and CLI have been reported to be higher in Non-Hispanic whites.  Patient History:  - Past smoker  quit 10 years ago (Smoking is a major risk factor for CLI) - Diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for 20 years (prolonged high blood sugar levels can affect vascular health  leading to PAD and CLI) - Hypertension for 15 years (can lead to peripheral arterial disease and eventually CLI) - Hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol levels diagnosed 10 years ago (can lead to atherosclerosis  a major cause of PAD  and ultimately CLI) - Family history of cardiovascular diseases (increases the risk of atherosclerosis and vascular problems) - Unexplained weight loss in the past few months (could indicate the deterioration of general health due to CLI)  Presenting Symptoms: - Severe lower extremity pain  especially noticeable at rest or at night - Non-healing or slow-healing ulcers and wounds in legs - Skin discoloration and temperature change indicating compromised blood flow - Gangrene in toes (in severe cases)  Considering the advanced age  medical history  and current symptoms  this patient is at high risk for critical limb ischemia or may already be experiencing it.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,39,"Patient Representation:  1. Demographics:    - Gender: Male    - Age: 70 years old    - Race: Caucasian     - Geographic Location: Rural midwest  United States    - Socioeconomic: Income below poverty line  has Medicaid  2. Past Medical History:    - Diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 15 years ago  not well controlled    - Diagnosed with diabetes type 2 for the last 20 years  suboptimally managed with oral hypoglycemic agents    - History of hypertension  controlled with medications    - History of hypercholesterolemia  not controlled as patient has difficulty in maintaining compliance with statin therapy due to financial constraints    - Former smoker  having smoked 1 pack/day for 30 years  but quit 3 years ago    - Remains relatively sedentary due to physical limitation associated with chronic pain in lower limbs    - Family history: Father had peripheral arterial disease and died from myocardial infarction at age 68  3. Presenting Complaints:    - Severe pain in the right leg  especially on walking short distances     - Ulcer present on the right big toe for the last 2 months  hasn't healed    - Reports coldness and numbness in right leg  This patient profile covers several risk factors commonly found in critical limb ischemia patients  primarily peripheral artery disease  diabetes mellitus type 2  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of smoking  and sedentary lifestyle. Risk factors are poorly managed  which contributes to the development of critical limb ischemia. This profile is typical for male patients  who are more commonly represented in critical limb ischemia cases. Patients from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and rural areas tend to have higher rates of critical limb ischemia due to reduced access to healthcare services. Caucasian race is also a noted demographic factor involved in higher prevalence rates of peripheral artery disease which often leads to critical limb ischemia.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Patient: Mr. Gonzales Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Living Environment: Urban Ethnicity: Hispanic Smoking Habit: Non-smoker Alcohol Intake: Moderate  Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the lower right leg  even while at rest  and presence of non-healing wound on the same leg.  Past Medical History: 1. Cardiovascular Disease: History of hypertension and atrial fibrillation  which have been managed for the past 10 years with regular medications. 2. Late-Onset Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 5 years ago  managing with diet  exercise and oral medication. 3. Prior Stroke: Has a record of a trans-ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago with full recovery. 4. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): Diagnosed with PAD since the last 8 years; initially managed with medications and lifestyle changes. 5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 3: Under treatment and monitoring for progression.  Family History: 1. Father passed away at age 75 due to myocardial infarction. 2. Mother had a history of hypertension and stroke  and passed away at age 92. 3. His older brother  age 72  has a history of PAD and type 2 diabetes.  Social History:  1. Mr. Gonzales is a retired teacher  currently living with his wife in an urban environment.  2. He stopped smoking 10 years ago and maintains a moderate intake of alcohol.  3. He tries to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle as recommended by his healthcare provider.   This patient's problem representation is based on the demographics of patients typically presenting with critical limb ischemia  which tends to occur more frequently in elderly patients  particularly those aged 60 to 80  and may also be linked to ethnicity  hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. This is in accordance with the literature (Norgren et al.  2007).
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,41,Patient Case Details:  Patient ID: MIC123 Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 72 Years Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupational History: Retired Truck Driver  Address: Albany  New York  USA  Medical History: The patient has a history of smoking heavily  has uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 10-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetic Neuropathy). The patient previously had mild heart attacks (Myocardial Infarctions) a few years ago  for which he underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).   Presentation: The patient presented with severe rest pain in the right lower limb which was not relieved by analgesics. The patient's symptoms are consistent with critical limb ischemia.  Clinical Evaluation: Upon examination  there is a noticeable decrease in the temperature of the right lower limb compared to the left lower limb. There are non-healing ulcers observed on the right foot (specifically  on the big toe)  with some regions of gangrene observed distally. Palpation reveals an absence of both the Dorsalis pedis and Posterior tibial artery pulses.  Relevant Tests: The patient's ankle-brachial index (ABI) was found to be <0.4 indicating severe arterial disease.   Pathophysiology:  Given the patient's uncontrolled diabetes and smoking history  the critical limb ischemia was a consequence of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). The atherosclerotic plaque formation narrowed the arteries  reducing blood flow to the lower extremities. The clinical presentation  alongside the patient's ABI levels  support the manifestation of this disease.  Outcome:  The patient was urgently admitted to the vascular surgery department for further treatment including possible revascularization procedures. However  prognosis is reserved given the severe presentation of the disease and the comorbidities like heart diseases and diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,42,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 68 years - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: White/Caucasian (as this demographic represents the highest percentage of individuals dealing with this problem) - Occupation: Retired - Housing: Lives alone in a single-story family home - Marital status: Widowed - Smoker: Yes (since smoking is a major risk factor) - Alcohol: Social drinker  Medical History: - Diabetes Mellitus (Type II) - Hyperlipidemia  - Generalized atherosclerosis - Hypertension - Previous myocardial infarction  - Previous peripheral vascular interventions  - Intermittent claudication  Presenting Symptoms: - Severe and constant leg pain that doesn't go away when at rest  - Wounds or ulcers on the feet or toes that are slow to heal (or not healing at all) - Gangrene on the toes or feet - Shiny  hairless skin on the legs and dark or bluish discoloration   This clinical depiction represents a typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI) based on statistical prevalences in the literature. The individual would be at higher risk given his advanced age  male gender  smoking habit  and array of chronic conditions like diabetes and atherosclerosis. The manifestation of symptoms correlates to the disease's progression.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,43,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic: The patient is a 73-year-old African American male with a history of obesity (BMI: 37.8) and tobacco use  presenting with severe pain at rest in the right lower extremity  notably the foot  that has been worsening over the past six months.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II of over fifteen years  both of which are poorly controlled. Three years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and was commenced on clopidogrel and statins. The patient has also suffered two myocardial infarctions with subsequent percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) within the past decade. The patient had been successfully abstinent from smoking for 3 years but returned to the habit following the death of his spouse a year ago.  Demographic relevance: According to several studies  there exists a higher prevalence of critical limb ischemia (CLI) among older individuals  with the mean age of diagnosis reported as seventy. The predominance of CLI in the Black population is unfortunately high and is associated with tobacco use  chronic kidney disease  and diabetes mellitus. Moreover  males are found to be more frequently affected by CLI.   Background: Critical limb ischemia is the most severe form of peripheral artery disease and presents with rest pain  non-healing ulcers  or gangrene due to chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease. Hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and high cholesterol levels  all of which our patient has  are significant risk factors for CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,44,Patient Information:  1. Geographical Location: Rural midwest United States 2. Age: 73 3. Sex: Male 4. Ethnicity: White 5. Occupation: Retired farmer 6. Marital Status: Widower 7. Alcohol Consumption: Moderate 8. Tobacco Usage: Heavy (56 pack-years)  Presenting Issue: Critical Limb Ischemia  Onset and Symptoms:  The patient presents to the outpatient vascular clinic with severe rest pain in the right leg for the past one month. The pain is of sudden onset  primarily in the foot  and is severe enough to disrupt sleep. There is no relief even with elevation or opioid-based medications. There are also non-healing ulcers on right foot and lower leg noted  initially developed as typical skin abrasions but have worsened and not healing over the past three weeks. His gait has also been affected  making it challenging to walk even short distances.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: Diagnosed 18 years ago  glycemic control is poor with recent HbA1c at 8%. 2. Hypertension: Diagnosed 12 years ago  on regular medication but poorly controlled. 3. Hypercholesterolemia: On statin therapy. 4. Coronary artery disease: Suffered a myocardial infarction six years ago  managed with drug-eluting stent placement. 5. History of Transient Ischemic Attack: Occurred two years ago with full recovery. 6. Peripheral Arterial Disease: Diagnosed eight years ago with intermittent claudication  under conservative management.  Family History: Father passed away from a heart attack  and mother from stroke. One older brother diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.   Social History:  The patient is a widower who lives alone but his adult children live close and provide regular support. He used to work as a farmer and is now retired. He has been a chronic smoker and continues to smoke heavily. Although counseled multiple times about smoking cessation  his attempts to quit smoking have been unsuccessful. His diet is high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables. He has a moderate alcohol intake  typically consuming 2-3 glasses of beer a day.  The patient is extremely anxious about the possibility of leg amputation  given the persistent pain and non-healing ulcers. Based on the presenting symptoms and past medical history  the differential diagnosis must consider progression of peripheral arterial disease into critical limb ischemia.

Present Illness:     He presents with severe pain in his left lower limb  which has worsened over the past month. He reports the pain as being persistent  even at rest. This is accompanied by non-healing foot ulcers and noticeable discoloration of his limb. He also occasionally experiences episodes of coldness and numbness.  3. Past Medical History:     Mr. X is a smoker with a 40-year history of one pack a day. He has a known medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia for the past 15 years medications for which he has been irregular.   He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 6 years ago for ischemic heart disease. His family history reveals that his father had peripheral artery disease and his mother had rheumatoid arthritis. His daily activity is limited due to arthritis and dyspnea on exertion.  4. Social History:     Mr. X lives with his wife and is a retired civil engineer. He has been sedentary since retirement and has an unhealthy  high-fat diet. He relies on his wife for all daily chores. He does not consume alcohol.  Problem Representation: A 72-year-old male with a significant history of cardiovascular disease—comprising smoking  hypertension  dyslipidemia  diabetes  ischemic heart disease  and family history of peripheral artery disease— presenting with continual severe pain in the left lower limb  non-healing ulcers  and discoloration of the limb  suggestive of critical limb ischemia. This is aggravated by his sedentary lifestyle  irregular medication  and unhealthy diet.  Note: The demographic and disease profile is based on the fact that critical limb ischemia is found to be more prevalent in those aged more than 50 years  who are overweight  and have a history of smoking  atherosclerosis  diabetes  high cholesterol levels  high blood pressure  kidney disease involving hemodialysis  ischemic stroke  or heart disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,46,Patient Profile   Name: James Robinson Age: 75 years  Race: White  Sex: Male  Weight: 70 kg Height: 175 cm Insurance: Medicare  Occupation: Retired   Presenting Complaint: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Past Medical History (PMH): Mr. James has previously been diagnosed with the following comorbid conditions:   1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (diagnosed 10 years ago) 2. Hypertension (HBP - diagnosed 12 years ago) 3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD - diagnosed 5 years ago) 4. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD - diagnosed 4 years ago)  Lifestyle Factors: Smoking: Ex-smoker who quit smoking 10 years ago after a 40-year history of tobacco use. Alcohol: Moderate drinker (1-2 drinks per week) Exercise: Sedentary due to severe claudication pain Diet: Not specifically controlled or monitored  Family History: 1. Father had coronary artery disease 2. Mother with diabetes and hypertension 3. Brother with diabetes and peripheral artery disease  Conducting a literature review  these demographics represent a typical profile for a CLI patient. CLI largely impacts seniors  particularly those over 70 with multiple systemic health conditions  particularly diabetes and cardiovascular disease. CLI is especially common among males and those with a history of smoking. This patient also has a relevant family history of the diseases.  This information can be helpful for clinicians to make an accurate diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan for Mr. James. The medical history and lifestyle factors of the patient should be taken into account in delivering  planning  and coordinating care to manage his CLI diagnosis. This evaluation will also help in predicting the risk  prognosis  and outcomes of treatment strategies.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,47,"Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 72 years  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Marital Status: Married  Demographics:  John is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  residing in an urban area. He is a retired office worker happily married with three children and four grandchildren. Clarified in studies  critical limb ischemia (CLI) is more common in men than in women and the risk increases with age. It is also more common in Caucasians than in African Americans.  Past Medical History:  1. Cardiovascular Diseases: John had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at the age of 64  post which he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and hypertension  both of which are known contributing factors for CLI.   2. Diabetes Mellitus: He has been living with type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years and has recently been having trouble managing his blood sugar levels.  3. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): He was diagnosed with PAD eight years ago. PAD is known to progress to CLI in some individuals.  4. Smoking: John has been a smoker for the past 40 years  averaging a pack per day.  5. Dyslipidemia: High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides were detected in his recent blood examination.  Symptoms:  Recently  John has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower limb  especially at rest during the night  associated with numbness and coldness. He also reported skin changes such as discoloration  and his wife noticed a non-healing wound on his right foot.  Based on his demographic profile  past medical history  and current symptoms  it seems that John's PAD could have advanced to critical limb ischemia (CLI)  requiring urgent medical attention.

Moreover  he's been having difficulty walking due to the intense pain.  Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease - Diagnosed 10-years ago 2. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 - Diagnosed 7 years ago  poorly controlled 3. Hypertension - Diagnosed and well-controlled for the past 15 years 4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - Diagnosed 5 years ago due to heavy smoking habit 5. Former smoker - Quit 5 years ago 6. Hyperlipidemia - Diagnosed and controlled for the past 10 years  Family History: 1. Father - Died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68 2. Mother - Living  has type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Medication History: The patient is on metformin  lisinopril  atorvastatin  aspirin  and a bronchodilator.  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Social History: The patient stopped smoking when diagnosed with COPD and has been free from alcohol for the past 10 years. He lives with his wife and two adult children. The patient is fairly active  engages in a daily walk  and enjoys gardening.  Based on the demographics and medical history  the patient with critical limb ischemia seems to fit well within the typical profile according to literature: generally older adults  predominantly males with a history of smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular diseases.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,51,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 73 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Hispanic - Occupation: Retired mechanic - Weight: 85 kg - Height: 1.75 m - BMI: 27.7  The patient is a former smoker who consumed one pack/daily for 25 years but quit 15 years ago. He has a past medical history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking metformin 500 mg twice daily and lisinopril 20 mg daily for his diabetes and hypertension respectively. The patient also has a history of intermittent claudication but has never been treated for peripheral arterial disease.  Clinical Scenario: The patient presents to the clinic with rest pain and non-healing wounds on his right foot that he first noticed about 8 weeks ago. On physical examination  his right foot is pale and cold with absent pulses. His pain intensifies at night and is only partially relieved when he hangs his foot over the edge of the bed. The non-healing wounds on the patient's foot are also associated with a foul odor. The patient reports significant weight loss over the past 6 months  and his appetite has decreased significantly. He also suffers from fatigue and weakness.  Relevant investigations would include a full blood count  lipid profile  glycated hemoglobin level  as well as imaging studies such as Doppler ultrasound and angiography to assess the extent and location of arterial blockage. A consultation with a vascular surgeon would also be pertinent for potential surgical management.   Problem representation: This is a 73-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of controlled hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  and intermittent claudication  who is a former smoker  presenting with right foot rest pain  non-healing wounds  significant weight loss  decreased appetite  fatigue  and weakness likely due to critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,52,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: -Mr. Smith -70-year-old Caucasian male -Current smoker - 1 pack/day for the past 45 years -Past history of hypertension -Lives alone  retired  Chief Complaint: -Chronic pain in his right lower leg  particularly while walking or during activity; Resting pain noticed over past couple of weeks  -Nonhealing wound on his right foot   Relevant Past Medical History: -Diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago -Previous myocardial infarction 4 years ago -Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  under oral medication -Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage III) -History of stroke with no residual deficits  5 years ago -Prior history of intermittent claudication for 2 years  Family History: -His father had peripheral artery disease -His mother was a diabetic -Younger brother passed away due to heart attack at the age of 68  Social History: -He lives alone in a two-story house -He has been a widower for 5 years  with 2 adult children living out of state -He's a former engineer  now retired -He does not consume alcohol -He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day -He's not involved in any physical activity or exercises  Diagnosis: Upon clinical examination  angiography and Doppler ultrasound  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia in the right leg.  Demographic Representation: A study by Norgren L  et al. (2007) suggest that Peripheral Arterial Disease and Critical Limb Ischemia are more prevalent in elderly  males  smokers  diabetics  those with renal insufficiency  prior history of cardiovascular diseases and patients with a family history of the disease. This aligns with Mr. Smith's demographic data. Mr. Smith's condition is also consistent with statistics indicating higher prevalence rates in Caucasians.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,53,Demographic Characterization: - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired factory worker - Marital Status: Married  - Residency: Urban  lower socio-economic area  Chief Complaint:  Persisting pain in the right lower limb and toe that has become progressively worse in the last six months.  Present Illness History: The patient has experienced intermittent claudication for the past year  initially felt after walking for more than 800 meters  which now causes discomfort after covering far lesser distances. For the last 3 months  he has been suffering from rest pain in the right foot  particularly during the night. He first noticed a small ulcer on the big toe of the right foot two months back  which is not healing properly.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 10 years ago  poorly controlled - Hypertension for the past 15 years - History of smoking for 30 years  Family History: - Father died of myocardial infarction in his early 60s - Mother has hypertension and diabetes  Medication History: - Currently on oral hypoglycemic agents  but irregular compliance - Anti-hypertensive medication   Physical Exam: Atrophied muscles in both legs  especially the right lower limb. Absent pulses in the right foot with associated bruits over the femoral artery. The right leg is notably colder than the left leg  and a non-healing ulcer is present on the big toe of the right foot.  Based on this case  the patient is displaying symptoms typical of critical limb ischemia brought on by peripheral artery disease. Risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular diseases are noted. The patient's demographics - being a retired  African American male over the age of 60 living in a lower socio-economic area - match the data found in literature regarding typical patient profiles for this condition. Moreover  the patient's poor control over his health conditions indicates the likelihood of the disease having advanced to a severe stage.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,54,Patient Profile:   Name: John Doe  Age: 70 years old  Gender: Male  Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupational History: Retired from construction industry after 45 years  Marital Status: Married Living Situation: Lives at home with his wife  Insurance: Medicare   Medical History:   1. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II  uncontrolled with insulin therapy for past 20 years 2. Hypertension disorder for the last 15 years  3. High cholesterol levels - Hyperlipidemia diagnosed 12 years ago  4. History of smoking for 3 decades  quit smoking ten years ago 5. Family History of cardiovascular diseases (father died of a heart attack at 65; elder brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at 70)  Presenting Complaint:   John has been experiencing severe pain in his left lower leg for the past month  especially at rest. He reports that the pain often intensifies at night and is somewhat relieved when he dangles his leg off the side of the bed. Furthermore  he has noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left foot's big toe and says his left foot always feels cold. Due to the pain  he has been unable to walk long distances.   Tentative Problem Representation:   John's clinical presentation  demographic information  and past medical history align with the classic signs of critical limb ischemia (CLI). His risk factors include advanced age  male gender  history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. These have likely resulted in significant peripheral arterial disease  leading to insufficient blood supply to meet the metabolic demands of his lower limb rest and particularly at night when cardiac output decreases. The non-healing ulcer on his foot could be an additional sign of impaired wound healing caused by ineffective blood supply. John's past medical history and presenting symptoms strongly suggest CLI. An urgent diagnostic evaluation is required  which will likely involve Doppler ultrasound  CT angiography  or MR angiography to confirm the diagnosis and to plan further management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,55,Patient Representation:  Patient Identifier: Patient X Gender: Male Age: 72 years  Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Income Level: Middle Class Occupation: Retired  Residence: Suburban   Past Medical History:  1. Diabetes Mellitus: Patient X was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and has struggled with maintaining consistent glycemic control.   2. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Patient X was diagnosed with PAD 5 years ago.   3. Smoking History: Patient X was a long term smoker  with a history of 30 pack years. He quit smoking 10 years ago.  4. Hypertension: Patient X has a history of hypertension for the past 20 years  mildly controlled with medication.  5. Hyperlipidemia: Patient X has elevated LDL cholesterol levels and is under statin therapy.   6. Cardiac History: Patient X suffered a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 7 years back and underwent stent placement.   Recent Presenting Complaint:  Patient X has been suffering from severe and continuous leg pain for the past month that worsens when he lies flat. The pain interrupts his sleep necessitating him to dangle his legs over the side of the bed or walk around. He also reports a non-healing wound on the dorsum of the same foot.  This patient representation indicates a typical elderly patient presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  with relevant cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  history of cardiac disease) and peripheral artery disease. The symptoms reported by the patient  such as resting leg pain and non-healing foot wound  are classical features of critical limb ischemia. The demographic details are representative based on literature indicating CLI is most common in elderly  male  Caucasians with a noted higher prevalence in people with a smoking history and poor glycemic control in diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,56,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 75-year-old Caucasian male patient presents to the hospital. The patient lives in an urban setup and belongs to the middle-income socio-economic status. He is a current smoker  with a smoking history of 40 years.  Presenting Complaint: He complains of severe pain in his left lower limb which increases when he tries to walk and decreases when he rests. He also mentions of a nonhealing wound on his left foot.  Co-morbities: History of long-standing hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled on antihypertensive medication. The patient has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed seven years back  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of dyslipidemia  and ischemic heart disease  having undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure 5 years ago.  Examination: On examination  left lower limb is pale and cool  with less hair growth. Foot pulses including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are not palpable. Non healing wound noted at the heel of the foot.  Based on this clinical picture  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is suspected  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease. This diagnosis is more common among older patients with risk factors like smoking  hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  and a history of cardiovascular disease  all of which are present in this patient.  Clinical investigations like ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  angiogram  as well as other blood biochemical parameters may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis  understand the severity  and plan appropriate management.    This problem representation will help to devise a suitable plan to manage this patient’s case effectively.

Physical Examination: - right lower extremity: pulses diminished  foot ulcer present - Cardiovascular examination: Regular heart rate and rhythm   Investigations: - hemoglobin A1c  lipid profile  ultrasound of the lower extremity  From the above information  the canonical representation of the problem would be:  A 71-year-old Caucasian male  with a past medical history significant for peripheral artery disease  smoking  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes  presents with worsening right leg pain and a non-healing foot ulcer  suggestive of critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic work-up and management strategies need to be planned in light of a complex medical history and high risk for systemic vascular complications related to PAD.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,58,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Lopez is a 74-year-old Hispanic male living in a suburban area. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife and their pet dog. He is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  but has a 30 pack-year history. He has occasional alcohol consumption and prefers a diet high in red meat and processed foods. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his BMI is classified as overweight.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Lopez presents with severe and continuous pain in his left lower limb which has worsened over the last month. The pain is more pronounced when walking and has begun to interfere substantially with his daily activities. The pain is also present while resting. He reports a significant decrease in his mobility. He also states his toes have been appearing dusky for the past week and he feels a constant cold sensation in his foot.   Past Medical History: Mr. Lopez has a past medical history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years and hypertension for the last 5 years. His most recent HBA1c was 8.2%  showing poor glycemic control. He also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for the last 3 years  and his latest eGFR was 45 ml/min/1.73 m2  demonstrating moderate renal impairment.   Family history indicates that his father had peripheral artery disease and his mother had a myocardial infarction.  Conclusion: Considering the advanced age  the male gender  his Hispanic ethnicity  past history of heavy tobacco use  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  renal impairment  and a family history of vascular disease  Mr. Lopez represents a high-risk profile for critical limb ischemia. The nature of his symptoms – severe  constant pain in the lower limb that occurs even at rest  limited mobility  and physical signs like dusky toes and cold foot – strongly support a clinical suspicion for critical limb ischemia. Timely evaluation and management is important to prevent further complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,59,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: John  a 73-year-old African-American male  has presented for a routine check-up at the clinic.  Network Encoding: The patient lives in an urban area  which is relevant considering geographical health disparities literature regarding the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) among urban-dwelling African-Americans.   Relevant Past Medical History: John has been battling systemic hypertension and type 2 diabetes for more than a decade  both controlled with medication. He has been a smoker for 50 years and  despite encouragement  has not been able to quit completely. John is considered obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32  and has a sedentary lifestyle. He has high cholesterol levels indicating dyslipidemia. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Current Complaint: For the past two months  he has been complaining about severe pain in his left leg  especially while walking. The pain is so intense it wakes him up from sleep and he also noticed that the leg appears paler in comparison to the right leg.  Clinical Assessment: The combination of his demographic  medical history  lifestyle  and current complaints suggest a strong possibility of critical limb ischemia  an advanced stage of PAD. His risk factors include long-standing hypertension  diabetes  smoking  dyslipidemia  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Next Step: More diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm this and to determine the extent of his condition. This may include an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test  ultrasound  angiogram  or a computed tomography (CT) angiography. His health care team needs to develop a comprehensive intervention plan aimed to alleviate the limb pain  curb disease progression  reduce the chance of limb loss  improve mobility  and address the associated risk factors. Get him to quit smoking and encourage physical activities under medical supervision  improve nutritional habits  and maintain tight control over his diabetes and hypertension.

Dyslipidemia – diagnosed 10 years ago  on Statin therapy 3. Hypertension – diagnosed 20 years ago  well-controlled with medication 4. Peripheral Vascular Disease – diagnosed 5 years ago 5. Smoker for 50 years; quit 2 years ago 6. No known allergies to medication 7. No previous surgical intervention  Physical Assessment: 1. Obese with a BMI of 32 2. Chronic ground ulcer on right foot  with the presence of gangrene 3. Absent peripheral pulse in the right lower limb 4. Skin is cold to touch and pale in color in the right lower limb  Pertinent lab results: 1. Recent HbA1c: 8% 2. Blood pressure at last visit was 160/90 mmHg 3. Ankle-brachial Index (ABI): 0.4 in the right lower limb 4. Doppler ultrasound: revealed severe stenosis in right lower limb arteries  Problem Representation: 71-year-old African-American male with a medical history of type II diabetes  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease presents with critical limb ischemia evidenced by rest pain  chronic foot ulcer  and marked ischemic signs in the right lower limb. Known smoker for many decades  but quit two years ago. Poor control of diabetes could be contributing to the progression of the disease. Lab results reveal high blood sugar and high blood pressure. The patient has severe comorbidity and is therefore an extreme candidate for revascularization procedures. The critical limb situation and the diabetic status call for urgent medical decisions to prevent limb amputation  optimize existing medical conditions and improve the patient's quality of life.                
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,61,Patient Profile: - Name: Rosa Morales. - Age: 72 years old. - Gender: Female. - Ethnicity: Hispanic. - Occupation: Retired nurse. - Current Location: Resides in a senior living community in Houston  Texas.  Presenting Issue: - Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the right lower leg  especially at rest. Also  she reported the presence of non-healing ulcers on her right foot.  Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  under control with medication. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed at age 50  sporadically controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. - Dyslipidemia: Known history of elevated LDL levels  managed with diet and statins. - Previous left big-toe amputation: Amputated due to gangrene from severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 3 years ago. - Tobacco Abuse: A heavy smoker with a history of 50 pack-years (quit smoking when diagnosed with diabetes). - Heart Disease: Diagnosed with ischemic heart disease 10 years ago  managed with medication and lifestyle changes.  Family History: - Father died at the age of 76 due to heart attack. - Mother passed away at 79 from complications of stroke and hypertension. - Older brother diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Social History: - Marital Status: Widow  has 3 children and 5 grandchildren. - Alcohol Use: Denied. - Drug Use: Denied. - Exercise: Minimal due to pain and limited mobility.  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease  which is primarily caused by atherosclerosis - a hardening and narrowing of the arteries. Risk factors include age  diabetes  smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol level  and heart diseases. Females vs males and Hispanic vs non-Hispanic ethnicity prevalence are reported in literature. Among elderly patients  there seems to be a trend towards significantly more women being affected by Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) and elderly females are far less often recognized at risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,62,Patient Profile:  Mr. John Smith  aged 68  is an African American male who lives in an urban setting. He is a retired construction worker. He has a family history of heart disease and has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol. He is also a heavy smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history.   John's past medical history includes myocardial infarction five years ago followed by angioplasty. He has been regularly taking medications for his heart condition and for his high cholesterol and hypertension. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ten years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic drugs.   Problem Representation:  Mr. Smith presents to the clinic with rest pain and non-healing wounds on his right foot for the past three weeks. On examination  there are signs of tissue loss in the foot. The pulses in the right foot are not palpable and there is significant decrease in temperature compared to the left foot. These symptoms indicate critical limb ischemia  possibly resulting from peripheral artery disease (PAD)  which is likely in the context of his demographic profile and past medical history of heart disease  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  high cholesterol and smoking  all of which are major risk factors for PAD.   The patient's demographic and health profile is consistent with literature reporting that PAD and critical limb ischemia are more common in patients who are older  male  and of African American ethnicity. Critical limb ischemia mostly affects people over 50  people with diabetes are at a four times higher risk  and smoking is one of the main contributing factors.   Further diagnostic tests such as Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound  Angiography or Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) will be needed for confirmation  grading the severity of the disease  and planning management strategy.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,63,Patient profile:  - Name: John Doe - Gender: Male - Age: 68 years - Race: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired construction worker  Medical History:  John has a history of type 2 diabetes for the past ten years and has a record of consistent tobacco use in the form of cigarette smoking for around 35 years  although he quit 5 years ago. He is also a heavy consumer of alcohol  consuming an average of 20 units per week.   Presenting Complaint:  John has been experiencing rest pain  particularly at night in his left lower leg. The occupation of his sleep due to this pain has been consistent over the past two weeks. Also  he reported a non-healing ulcer on his left great toe  which was noticed about a month ago which has been progressively worsening.   Risk Factors:  The present significant risk factors include advanced age  male gender  Caucasian race  history of heavy smoking  and alcohol use  and more critically type 2 diabetes which is known for its connection with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Based on these factors  John is diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. This clinical presentation combined with the respective risk factors aligns with the literature on typical patient profiles presenting with critical limb ischemia. As a note  peripheral arterial disease leading to critical limb ischemia largely affects older individuals  those with diabetes  and is more common in men and Caucasian ethnicity. Smoking and alcohol use add on to the risk  which seems to be the case in this patient.

Non-healing ulcer on right foot 4. Pain on passive movement of right foot 5. Blood Pressure: 150/90 mmHg 6. BMI: 30 (Obese)  Summary: Mr. X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a significant history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and PAD  presenting with critical limb ischemia  as evidenced by severe intermittent pain greatly affecting his quality of life  non-healing ulcers on his foot  pallor  reduced peripheral pulses  and pain on passive movement of the affected limb.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,65,Patient Profile:  1. Patient Details:    - Name: Patient X    - Age: 74 years    - Gender: Male    - Race: Caucasian    - Occupation: Retired    - Marital Status: Married    - Location: Urban  2. Chief Complaint:    - Symptoms of pain  skin changes  and/or tissue loss in the lower limbs  3. Relevant Past Medical History:    - 10 years of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  uncontrolled despite medication.    - 8-year history of hypertension.    - Chronic smoking  averaging one pack per day for the past 30 years. Tried to stop a couple of times but relapsed.    - Diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 3 years ago.    - History of a heart attack 5 years ago  managed with angioplasty.    - Rest pain in the legs and feet for the past 6 months  which is progressive.    - History of raising cholesterol levels for the past few years.     4. Family History:    - Father had a heart attack at age 68.    - Mother died from stroke at age 71.  5. Social History:    - Used to work as an accountant.    - Retired for 10 years.     - Lives with wife. His children live in other states.    - No alcohol use  but continues to smoke despite constant suggestions to quit.  6. Review of Systems:    - Intermittent claudication (pain in the legs when walking  which disappears with rest)    - Reported numbness in feet and toes    - Non-healing ulcers on feet    - Erectile dysfunction reported    - No issues with bowel or bladder    - Reports difficulty sleeping due to leg pain  7. Drug History:    - Long-term use of Metformin and Lisinopril  but inconsistent due to side effects and claims of forgetfulness.    - He uses aspirin regularly  as advised after his old heart attack.    Take into account that the majority of patients presenting with Critical Limb Ischemia are typically elderly with a median age of 71-75 years  predominantly males  with a history of smoking and multiple comorbidities  in which diabetes and hypertension are highly prevalent. The patient's lack of control over his diabetes and continued smoking are significant risk factors that have likely contributed to the development and progression of Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,66,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Maria Brown Age: 72 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired bank clerk Residential area: Suburban  Demographic Background: Mrs. Maria Brown is a 72-year old Caucasian female from a suburban area. She is a retired bank clerk living with her adult married daughter and grandchildren. She is a widow and suffers from social isolation due to the loss of her spouse 5 years ago  causing a chronic stress state. Literature prevalence rates of critical limb ischemia are slightly higher in Caucasians  aged more than 70 years  and relatively more common in females.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Brown has a long history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for the past 10 years. She has been treated with medications and lifestyle modification  but her condition is progressively worsening. She is suffering from diabetes mellitus type II for the last 15 years and has hypertension for the past 20 years. She has a previous history of mild stroke with completely recovered neurologic function about 5 years ago. She is known to have Hyperlipidemia. Besides that  frequent episodes of stress-induced angina have been reported and were treated accordingly. Mrs. Brown was a smoker but she quit smoking a decade ago. She has been regularly taking medications including Metformin for diabetes  Ramipril for hypertension  Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  Aspirin as antiplatelet  and treatment for her angina.   Recent Problem: Recently  Mrs. Brown complains about a chronic wound on her right foot that is not healing for the past 3 months. She is reporting rest pain in her right calf muscles especially at night that resulted in sleep disturbances. Apart from this  she suddenly lost weight as she is losing her appetite due to fear of amputation related to her non-healing wound.   These demographic and health conditions of Mrs. Brown make her a typical patient presenting with symptoms of critical limb ischemia. As literature suggests older ages  presence of comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of stroke  peripheral arterial disease  and smoking habit are common risk factors for critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,67,Title: Patient Problem Representation for Critical Limb Ischemia  Description: Mr. J. Walker is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower extremity  particularly at night disturbing his sleep. He also reports non-healing ulcers on the foot of the same leg.   Demographics: 1. Age: 68 years 2. Sex: Male 3. Ethnicity: Caucasian 4. Occupation: Retired Mechanical Engineer  Relevant Medical History: - Hypertension  diagnosed approx. 12 years ago  managed with medication. - Diabetes Mellitus Type II  diagnosed 8 years ago with poor glycemic control (latest HbA1C value: 8.5%) - Smoking: 30 pack-years (quit 6 months ago). - Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Diagnosed 3 years ago. - Has been on aspirin 81 mg daily for the past 3 years for PAD. - No history of allergies.  Current Complaint: Presenting with severe pain in his right lower extremity  particularly at night  along with non-healing ulcers. No mention of any trauma. No recent changes in medications.   Investigations: Blood panel for complete blood count  renal function  liver function  lipid profile  and blood glucose. Further diagnostics include an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and if needed  angiography for assessing the extent of arterial blockage.   The aforementioned data reflects the typical individual at risk for critical limb ischemia (CLI)  as per available literature. Major risk factors for CLI like age (>60 years)  male gender  Caucasian ethnicity  history of smoking  poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and preexisting peripheral artery disease are all incorporated in this patient's presentation. The demographic details and past medical history are aligned with accurate demographic representation  observed in actual CLI cases.   The real-world problem of non-healing ulcers and rest pain reflects advanced PAD (often depicted as CLI)  requiring immediate intervention to prevent further complications like amputation or severe infection.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,68,Patient Profile:  [Name]: John Doe [Gender]: Male [Age]: 68 years old [Race/Ethnicity]: African American [Marital Status]: Married [Occupation]: Retired  Presenting Problem: John Doe is suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI)  manifesting as severe pain in his right leg even at rest  with related symptoms including non-healing wounds on the foot  and noticeable changes in the skin color and temperature of the leg. He reported sudden weight loss and walking disability due to the pain.  Medical history: John Doe has a history of smoking for the past 35 years  and quit 5 years ago. He has a 10 years history of diabetes and hypertension  both tightly controlled on medications. His cholesterol levels have always been on the higher side even with strict diet control.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had a heart attack at the age of 60 and his elder brother underwent bypass surgery at the age of 55.  Surgical history: John underwent appendectomy 30 years ago.  Other relevant information: John is a whisky lover but drinks in moderation - one standard drink per day. He does not work out regularly.   Review of Systems: John reports symptoms consistent with severe peripheral arterial disease  including intermittent claudication  rest pain  and non-healing wounds on the foot. He also mentioned feeling fatigued more often recently.  Problem Analysis: Considering John’s age  gender  race  longstanding history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension and family history of heart diseases  he is at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases  including critical limb ischemia. His symptoms  in particular the rest pain  walking disability and non-healing wounds  strongly suggest CLI. John's condition is critical and could lead to limb loss or disability if not treated aggressively and promptly. The fatigue might be an indicator of his body suffering from cardiovascular stress and poor blood circulation attributed by lifestyle and genetic predisposition. It is worth noting his uncontrolled cholesterol could contribute to the progression of his CLI. His moderate intake of alcohol could play a role  though its effects on vascular conditions vary in literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,69,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe  Age: 72 years  Sex: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired  Education: Completed high school  Marital Status: Married   Residence: Urban   Smoker: Former heavy smoker (Quit 15 years ago)  Alcohol: Social drinker  Weight: Overweight (BMI: 28)  Patient's History:  A 72-year-old African American male  retired  married  with a high school education level  presenting with critical limb ischemia. He is a former heavy smoker  quit 15 years ago  and drinks alcohol socially. The patient is overweight with a BMI of 28.   Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Patient has had a history of hypertension for the past 20 years. The condition is managed with medication (Lisinopril 10 mg daily).  2. Diabetes: Patient has type 2 diabetes for the last 15 years  controlled with diet  exercise  and metformin.  3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Diagnosed five years ago. Patient underwent angioplasty in the right leg three years ago.  4. Myocardial Infarction: Suffered from a myocardial infarction eight years ago. Has been on medication (Aspirin 75 mg daily and Atorvastatin 20 mg daily) since then.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with severe pain in his left leg  which has been intensifying over the last six months. The pain is constant  even at rest  and has been disturbing his sleep. He also reports non-healing sores on his left foot and toes  occasional leg cramps  and numbness in the leg.   Reason for Visit:  Due to these symptoms  he has come for a medical evaluation and possible treatment of what appears to be Critical Limb Ischemia.   Patient's Family History:  His father had a history of stroke at age 74 and his mother had diabetes and hypertension. His only sibling  a brother  died at the age of 64 from a heart attack.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,70,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male who appears to be suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). He resides in a semi-urban community situated in the Southern United States. He is a retired civil engineer  with a moderate social-economic status. He has been a smoker all his adult life (1-2 packs/day)  predominantly consuming a diet high in fat and sodium but low in fruits and vegetables. He lives alone in the family home since his wife died two years ago  and has few social support networks.  The patient is slightly obese with a body mass index of 31. He was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - which is poorly controlled - and hypertension. His daily medications include oral antihyperglycemic agents (Metformin)  an antihypertensive (Losartan)  and a statin (Atorvastatin).   He has a documented history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed six years ago  with previous balloon angioplasty performed 3 years back. He recently consulted the emergency department complaining of severe aching pain in his lower extremities  particularly his right leg  even at rest. He also reported a non-healing ulcer on his right foot  along with a noticeable coldness and discoloration compared to his left lower limb.  This patient is representative of a typical CLI patient as research suggests a higher prevalence of CLI amongst patients who are male  above 60 years  of African American ethnicity  live in Southern United States and who suffer from type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Smoking  a sedentary lifestyle  a diet low in nutrients but high in fat and sodium  and poor socio-economic status are known risk factors for CLI. The presence of PAD points towards the established progressive arterial disease.    The symptoms described by the patient; rest pain  ischemic ulcers  and a difference in temperature between limbs are representative of clinical manifestations of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,71,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired factory worker Residence: Urban area  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presents with a complaint of severe  unrelenting pain in his right leg  even at rest. He also reports numbness and weakness in the same leg. He has noticed a wound on the foot that is not healing.   Past Medical History: 1. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  currently on treatment with Metformin and insulin therapy. 2. Diagnosed hypertension for the past 10 years which is managed with Losartan. 3. Has a history of tobacco use with a record approximately 20 pack-years  but quit 5 years ago. 4. Had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) 8 years ago. 5. Chronic kidney disease stage 3 diagnosed 2 years back.  Family History: His father died of stroke at an elderly age and his mother had type 2 diabetes as well. He has two siblings  one of whom has type 2 diabetes.  Social History: Lives alone  post the demise of his wife 3 years ago. Does not consume alcohol. No history of drug abuse.   This profile describes a typical patient with risk factors for critical limb ischemia such as old age  type 2 diabetes  hypertension  history of tobacco use  and myocardial infarction. It is known that older age  male gender  African American race  diabetes  smoking  and history of cardiovascular disease are associated with a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. Moreover  the presence of chronic kidney disease in this patient further heightens the risk.      These details are important because they would guide diagnostic testing and determine treatment strategies for the patient. The patient's social circumstances should also be taken into account when considering treatment options.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,72,Problem Representation:  A 70-year-old African American male patient presents with progressive  unrelenting severe pain in the lower extremities at rest  particularly in the left lower calf region  leading to sleep disturbances. The patient reports numbing and cooling of the left foot  unstable gait and minor ulcers in the dorsum of foot and in between toes. There is history of non-healing wound in the left foot from last two months despite regular cleaning and dressing.   Demographic Characteristic: According to the literature  critical limb ischemia is more common in elderly African American males than other ethnicities  the patient's demographic representation is consistent with this trend.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history  including smoking for 30 years (1-pack daily)  uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus poorly controlled with metformin  and dyslipidemia managed with statins. There is also a past history of stroke 6 years ago leading to mild residual right-sided weakness and occasional slurring of speech. Family history is positive for peripheral artery disease (PAD) with his father having bilateral lower limb amputations due to gangrene secondary to PAD.  Analysis:  High risk factors for critical limb ischemia (CLI) that our patient presents with include advanced age  male sex  African American ethnicity  tobacco abuse  history of stroke  family history of PAD  uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipemia. The severe pain in the lower extremities  particularly at rest  along with ulcers in his dorsum of foot and between toes  suggests advanced disease. The patient's demographic characteristics and clinical presentation are consistent with critical limb ischemia. According to the literature  almost half of cases with critical limb ischemia can have concomitant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease  which is reflected in this patient's medical history too.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,73,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic Information: - Sex: Male - Age: 73 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired manual laborer - Socioeconomic Status: Middle income - Lifestyle: Current smoker with history of alcohol consumption  lack of physical activity  Relevant Medical History: - Cardiovascular Disease: Diagnosed with atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) five years ago - Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes  poorly controlled - Hyperlipidemia: High cholesterol  currently managed with statins - Hypertension: Currently controlled with medication - Obesity: BMI of 33  - History of stroke: one minor stroke episode two years ago with no residual neurological deficits - Kidney Disease: mild chronic kidney disease  Presentation: The patient presents with severe pain in his right calf and foot  which is worsened with activity and somewhat relieved by rest. He also experiences pain at rest that tends to be worse at night. He's had an open non-healing wound on his right foot for the past four weeks. It began as a small blister that now has become a large ulcer with blackish tissue in the center. He also notes a distinct coldness in the affected limb  along with color changes and decreased hair growth.  On physical examination  there is a reduced right ankle-brachial index and diminished pedal pulses. His right foot appears pale when elevated and turns reddish-blue on dependency. The ulcer on his foot is around 3 cm in diameter with exposed deep tissues  the depth of wound is around 1 cm  located on the plantar surface of his foot.  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease  is suspected due to the aforementioned signs and symptoms. The patient's significant history of smoking  diabetes  and atherosclerosis  prior diagnosis of PAD combined with the current presentation of rest pain and non-healing foot ulcers highly suggest CLI.  Reference: Data on the demographic representation are based on CLI risk factors as presented in multiple studies  indicating that patients at risk are commonly older adults  predominantly males  with a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,74,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 75 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Location: Rural Midwestern United States  Family History: Father passed away at the age of 70 due to complications from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Mother is 77 and has a history of chronic hypertension.  Personal Medical History: 1. Heavy cigarette smoker for the past 50 years  recently quit. 2. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago  currently managed with insulin. 3. Diagnosed with hypertension  managed with beta-blockers. 4. History of obesity  current BMI of 32. 5. Had a “heart attack” (myocardial infarction) at the age of 60. 6. History of elevated cholesterol levels  managed with statins.  Presenting Problem: Over the past month  Mr. Doe has been experiencing increasing pain in his left lower leg  described as aching and severe  that is made worse by walking and relieved by rest. In recent days  he reports that the pain has become persistent at rest  especially at night. He also reports that his left foot feels colder than his right foot  and has changed color to pale when elevated and reddish when dependent. Upon inspection  trophic skin changes (thin  shiny skin with loss of hair) are noticed  as well as weak or absent lower pulses on the left side.  Based on the patient's history and physical examination  the preliminary diagnosis is critical limb ischemia (CLI)  likely secondary to progressed peripheral arterial disease  a common consequence of long-standing diabetes  hypertension  smoking  obesity  and hypercholesterolemia. Confirmation of the diagnosis would be established by Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) and contrast angiography or other imaging techniques showing severe arterial stenoses or occlusion.  Initial treatment would include medication adjustments and potential consideration of revascularization methods after a thorough risk-benefit analysis. The patient would also be educated on the importance of strict diabetes and blood pressure control  cholesterol management  and lifestyle changes including a heart-healthy diet  regular exercise  weight loss  and complete cessation of tobacco use. This case represents a need for multidisciplinary care involving primary care  cardiology  vascular surgery  and diabetes/endocrine specialists.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,76,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Address: 400 Park Avenue  Manchester  NY  USA Occupation: Retired Marital Status: Widowed  Medical History:  1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diagnosed 15 years ago and on oral hypoglycemic medication. Periodic blood glucose levels fluctuating but generally controlled with medicine and diet. 2. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 10 years ago and on statin therapy. 3. Hypertension: Diagnosed 13 years ago and on antihypertensive medication. 4. History of Smoking: Smoked one pack a day for 40 years. Quit five years back. 5. Previous Myocardial Infarction: Suffered a heart attack 8 years ago  managed with angioplasty and stenting. 6. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Diagnosed 3 years ago.  Current Symptoms and Complaints:  John has been experiencing severe pain in his left lower leg for the last six months  which has now worsened. The pain has recently become constant and is keeping him awake at night. Moreover  he has noticed the leg often feels cold  and the skin color has become pale. Skin ulcers have started to appear on his left foot  which are not healing well. In the last couple of months  he has noticed a decrease in the hair growth on his left leg. John has also been increasingly tired  which he initially attributed to his age  but it has been affecting his daily activities lately.  Note: Statistics show that critical limb ischemia is common in men over 70 with a history of diabetes  smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and cardiovascular disease. Renal insufficiency also increases the risk. Poor control of underlying conditions further increases the likelihood. Caucasian race has a reportedly higher risk. The patient profile generated is hence aligning with the typical demographic and clinical representation of critical limb ischemia patients as found in literature. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,77,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: • Patrick Stone  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  has presented with signs of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Presenting Issue: •The patient has been experiencing rest pain in his right lower limb  particularly in his foot  for the past few weeks  especially during the nighttime. He has also noticed some non-healing wounds (ulcers) in the same foot. He has lost some weight unintentionally and noticed decreased appetite.  Past Medical History: • Mr. Stone has a long history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which has been poorly controlled over the past decade. • He has been on treatment for hypertension for the past 15 years. • He has a history of smoking  with an average of 15 cigarettes per day for around 50 years. • There is a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed around five years ago. • He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 10 years ago after a heart attack. • He is overweight with a BMI of 29.  Family History: • His father had a history of heart disease and his mother had diabetes. Both parents are deceased. • His older brother  aged 75  has a history of stroke.  Medications: • Regular medication includes Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime for cholesterol.  Overview: • Mr. Stone's demographic factors (age  gender  and race)  lifestyle (smoking and sedentary occupation)  and medical history  particularly cardiovascular disease  diabetes  and hypertension make him a typical patient for CLI. His smoking history and poorly managed diabetes are likely contributors to his PAD. • The severity of his CLI implies a considerable risk for limb amputation if not managed carefully  along with ominous implications for his life expectancy  given the associated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,80,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67 years old Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian  Demographic Characterization:  John is a retired construction worker living in the urban Midwest. He is married with three adult children and five grandchildren. He is a veteran  and his healthcare is provided by Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. His economic status is lower-middle class. He is a smoker and has a history of heavy drinking until 10 years ago  when he stopped.  Past Medical History:  John has been a type 2 diabetic for 20 years. His blood sugar levels are generally under control with oral medication  but he has occasional episodes of hyperglycemia  especially under stress. His diabetic control has been compromised over the years with him frequently forgetting to take his medication.  He had a myocardial infarction seven years ago  and has been on medication for coronary artery disease including aspirin  statins  and beta blockers. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension for which he takes a diuretic.   John was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years ago  presenting with intermittent claudication. He managed his symptoms with lifestyle changes and medication.  Recent Presentation:  Over the past few months  his leg pain has increased significantly  especially when he's not physically active. He has also noticed wounds on his toes that are not healing and recurring rest pain. Upon evaluation for these symptoms  he has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.   Relevant Findings:  His lower extremities show signs of decreased hair growth  shiny skin  and pallor. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) test scored less than 0.4 indicating severe blockage and poor circulation. He is definitive for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) based on these findings.  Despite efforts to manage the risk factors created by his smoking  diabetes  hypertension and high cholesterol  they have collectively contributed towards his CLI.   He's scheduled for further evaluation to assess his candidacy for revascularization. His options are limited by the critical extent of his disease  and amputation is a feared risk. His family is supportive but anxious about his prognosis. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,81,Patient Profile: - Gender: Male  - Age: 75 years old - Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic white  - Residence: Urban living conditions  - Socioeconomic Status: Lower-income bracket  Past Medical History: - Chronic smoker for 50 years  1 pack per day - History of uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus type II for the last 10 years - Previous diagnosis of Hypertension for 5 years  intermittent medication adherence - Known case of Peripheral Arterial Disease for 2 years - Prior history of a myocardial infarction 1 year ago   Presenting Symptoms: The patient has been experiencing progressively worsening pain in his right lower limb for the past 3 months. The pain typically intensifies when he walks more than half a block and somewhat relieves with rest. But recently  the pain has started even at rest. He also describes a sensation of numbness and tingling in his foot and leg. He has noticed that his right foot appears paler and is much colder to touch compared to the left one. He has lost weight over the past few weeks and has been feeling fatigued.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination  his right foot appears pale and cool to the touch  with diminished sensation and loss of hair. Capillary refill is significantly delayed (>3s) compared to the left foot. Pulses in the right lower limb are notably weaker compared to the left. His BP is elevated at 155/90 mmHg.  The above problem representation is based on demographic and clinical characteristics frequently observed in patients with critical limb ischemia. Males  older patients  smokers  diabetics  hypertensive  lower-income individuals  prior history of myocardial infarction  and patients with peripheral arterial disease are more likely to develop this condition. Clinical presentation is usually progressive with pain at rest  numbness  and palpable temperature differences being common symptoms  along with signs such as pallor  coldness  and decreased pulses in the affected limb. Urgent intervention is often needed to restore circulation and prevent limb loss.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,82,Patient Profile - Age: 70 years old. - Sex: Male - Race: White - Occupation: Retired - Living conditions: Lives alone  in an urban area.  Presenting Issue: Critical limb ischemia in the right lower limb  present for 2 weeks. The patient complains of severe rest pain in the right foot  even at rest. He also reports of non-healing sores on his right foot and lower leg.  Demographics:  The patient is a 70-year-old white male  a retired manager. Current literature shows that critical limb ischemia mainly affects older people  with the incidence increasing with age  and it is more common in males. His race and age puts him in a higher risk category for this condition.  Past Medical History:  - Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years ago. He is on medication for managing his heart condition  including aspirin  statins and beta-blockers. - Diabetes: He has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  with irregular glycemic control. - Hyperlipidemia: The patient has known high cholesterol levels. - Smoking: He has a 40-year history of smoking  though he quit 5 years back. - Hypertension: He has been suffering from hypertension for 10 years. - Lower back pain: The patient frequently experiences lower back pain and a diminished walking capacity due to peripheral artery disease.  Relevant Information:  - Family history: Father died of a heart attack at age 65  mother had stroke at age 72. - Social history: The patient lives alone  is a widower with 2 adult children. He is a retired manager  not very physically active  and depends mainly on prepared meals. His alcohol consumption is minimal. - Review of systems: Apart from the symptoms presented  the patient reports episodes of chest tightness and shortness of breath  occasional dizziness  and increasingly frequent erectile dysfunction.  The patient's lifestyle  past medical history and demographic characteristics make him a typical patient presenting with critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,83,Patient Profile:   Mr. John Doe  72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of 35 years of continuous smoking  presents with severe rest pain in his left leg  worsening over the past three months. The pain increases during the night and often wakes him up from sleep. He also has non-healing ulcers on his left foot for the past 2 months.  Demographic characterization:  - Age: 72 years - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer - Smoking History: 35 years  15 cigarettes per day - Living Situation: Lives with wife in a suburban community - Geographic Location: Midwest U.S.  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Type-2-Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 12 years ago  poorly controlled with an average HbA1c of 8.0 in the past year - Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled well with combination of medications - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 8 years ago treated with statins - Peripheral arterial disease: Diagnosed 5 years ago  treated conservatively with medication and lifestyle changes  - History of two episodes of Transient Ischemic Attacks  6 years and 3 years ago  Present Medications:  1) Metformin 1000mg twice daily  2) Lisinopril 20mg once daily 3) Amlodipine 5mg once daily 4) Atorvastatin 40mg once daily 5) Clopidogrel 75mg once daily  Family History:  - Father died of myocardial infarction at age 65 - Mother has hypertension and type 2 diabetes  alive at age 90 - One brother died in a car accident  had history of smoking and hyperlipidemia  Completing the picture:  Mr. Doe represents a typical patient with critical limb ischemia  in line with demographic data as older age  male gender  being Caucasian and having a significant history of smoking and poorly controlled diabetes are known risk factors of the disease. His history of peripheral arterial disease and transient ischemic attacks further increase his risk.   His presentation with rest pain and non-healing ulcers coincide with typical symptoms of critical limb ischemia. His family history additionally points to a genetic tendency towards cardiovascular disease. His living situation and current medications are important considerations for any upcoming treatment plans and interventions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,84,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a 76-year-old Caucasian male who is currently residing in an urban dwelling in New York City. He is divorced and lives alone. He is a retiree and his primary language is English. He has a high school education and his primary source of income is his pension. He is a lifelong smoker  with a history of smoking one pack per day for the past 50 years and he is currently attempting to quit smoking. He has a reported history of moderate alcohol consumption  although he denies any current alcohol use. He also has a history of a high-fat diet and has been obese for most of his life.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a multi-faceted past medical history. The most significant include a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed a decade ago. He also has a 15-year history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He had a myocardial infarction 8 years ago  followed by a coronary artery bypass graft procedure. He has chronic kidney disease stage III. He also suffers from hyperlipidemia and takes daily statin therapy for it.   He has been non-compliant with his medication  frequently missing doses of his oral anti-diabetic agents and antihypertensives. He also has a history of intermittent claudication and has been hospitalized three times in the past two years for foot ulcers. His other medical conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  possibly secondary to his long history of smoking  and osteoarthritis which limits his mobility.  Family History: His familial history reveals that his father died at the age of 70 due to complications related to diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. His mother died at 68 of stroke and also suffered from hypertension and high cholesterol. He has two siblings; an older brother who is living with recognized PAD and a younger sister who has had a stroke.  Vitals: Blood Pressure: 160/95 mmHg  Pulse: 78 bpm  BMI: 30 kg/m^2  Temperature: 98.7 F  Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute  Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a grade 2 systolic murmur  decreased peripheral pulses  bilateral rales in the lungs  and bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities. There are visible foot ulcers with surrounding erythema and blackish discoloration on his right big toe  suggestive of gangrene.   The overall presentation along with the demographic data and past medical history is suggestive of critical limb ischemia being the most urgent problem that needs to be addressed to avoid the risk of limb amputation in Mr. Johnson. His risk factors include age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  family history  and hyperlipidemia which correlate with ischemic events based on literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,85,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 29  representing the overweight category. He is a long-term tobacco smoker  with a history of 40 pack-years  and continues to smoke currently. He is retired but was formerly employed in a physically demanding job that didn't involve consistent exercise routines. The patient lives with his wife and is generally sedentary  spending most of the day watching TV and undertaking minor house chores.   Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus poorly controlled by metformin. He also has Hypertension  hyperlipidemia controlled with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)  and statins  respectively.   Presenting Problem:  The patient is presenting with rest pain in the right lower extremity that intensifies at night and has been awakening him from sleep. On examination  the right lower limb exhibits decreased skin temperature  weak pedal pulses  and non-healing ulcers over the heel and toes.   Problem Summary: This is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history of diabetes and hypertension  presenting with classic symptoms of critical limb ischemia in the right lower limb  including rest pain and non-healing ulcers. His cardiovascular risk factors include smoking  sedentary lifestyle  age  hyperlipidemia  and obesity. This clinical presentation requires urgent attention due to the risk of limb loss associated with severe peripheral arterial disease causing critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,86,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Mr. James  a 78-year-old African American male  presents with symptoms aligning with critical limb ischemia. He is from an underserved socioeconomic background and resides in an urban environment.  Presenting Complaint:   He reports a 3-week history of constant  severe pain in his right lower limb that is persisting even at rest. The pain significantly escalates at night and disturbs his sleep. Furthermore  he also complains of visible skin color changes on his right leg (pale skin)  and occasional tingling sensation.   Past Medical History:   Mr. James has a known history of Type II Diabetes  Hypertension  and Hyperlipidemia. He had a Myocardial Infarction 7 years ago  for which he underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery. His diabetes has been poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet. His history also includes a 50-pack-year of smoking  but he quit 5 years ago after his heart surgery.   Family History:  Significant for a history of Cardiovascular Disease in his father and two older brothers. His mother had Type II Diabetes and Hypertension.   Relevant Physical Exam Findings:  Upon examination  right lower limb is cold to touch as compared to the left one. The pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis are not palpable in the right leg. He has visible skin discoloration changes (pallor) and his toes show signs of necrosis.   In light of the patient's complaints  history  and physical findings  a diagnosis of Right Lower Limb Critical Limb Ischemia is entertained. Investigations including Duplex ultrasound  CT Angiography  Transcutaneous oximetry are planned to assess the disease progression and devise an appropriate management plan.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,87,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 72 Race: White Smoking History: Yes - 30 pack years  Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old white male  is presenting with gradual  severe pain in his right lower leg which he has been experiencing for the past month or so. The intensity of the pain is such that it interferes with both his sleep and daily activities. He reports his leg is also noticeably cooler compared to the other. There is visible skin discoloration and presence of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. Recently  he has been troubled by claudication pain as well  which has been worsening his overall condition.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for 20 years and is a long-term smoker  with a history of 30 pack years. He has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past ten years. Patient also reports a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease 5 years prior. There is no history of heart attack or any other cardiovascular event.  Risk Factors: Given the patient's history of longstanding uncontrolled diabetes  a 30 pack-year smoking history  hypertension  peripheral artery disease and the age and gender  he has a high risk of critical limb ischemia. Such demographic and medical history place the patient at the high-risk end of the spectrum for critical limb ischemia.  This patient's problem representation prioritizes characteristic information such as demographic characteristics (age  gender  race) past medical history (diabetes  hypertension  peripheral artery disease)  and risk factors (smoking) that indicate the high possibility of developing critical limb ischemia. It also demonstrates typical symptoms reported in literature such as pain  leg coolness  skin discoloration  non-healing ulcers  and claudication.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,88,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: The patient is a 75-year-old African American male who resides in an urban area. He lives alone and has a history of low socioeconomic status. As per the literature  African American male patients of lower socioeconomic status have a slightly higher likelihood of developing critical limb ischemia.   - Past Medical History: He has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus which is poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. In addition  he suffers from peripheral artery disease (PAD)  for which he underwent a left tibial artery stenting procedure five years ago. The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels which are controlled with medication. The patient has been a smoker for the past 50 years  with no significant alcohol history.   - Family History: His father died at the age of 80 due to complications from a heart attack. His mother died at the age of 75 from stroke.   Current Clinical Presentation:  The patient presents with severe rest pain in the left lower extremity  which is worse at night and often interrupts sleep. The pain is relieved by lowering the leg. He's been feeling a numbing sensation in the same leg for the past six months. His foot appears pallor when elevated and rubor when dangled. He has a non-healing ulcer on the left big toe with blackening  dating back to two months. Upon examination  there are weak popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses. He walks with a limp and complains of coldness in his leg.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation and history  the patient potentially has critical limb ischemia of the left leg. Further diagnostic procedures such as angiography  ankle-brachial index (ABI)  and toe-brachial index (TBI) can confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.   To add more details about the patient  he currently takes Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for his hypertension  and Atorvastatin for high cholesterol. He is non-compliant with his medications and follows an unhealthy diet. He has never attended a diabetes clinic nor received advice regarding foot care. His last check-up was about a year ago. His BMI is 30  and recently he has lost about 10 lbs. due to decreased appetite. He was advised to quit smoking on several occasions  but his efforts have been unsuccessful.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,89,Patient Profile:  Name: John White Age: 73 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired automobile industry worker Residence: Urban area  Midwest  USA  Presenting Issue: John presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He complains of severe pain in his right leg  which has become constant over the past few months. John reports that the pain has become increasingly intense when he is resting  and often wakes him up at night. His leg has a pale coloration and feels cold to the touch. He has also started experiencing sores on his right foot and lower leg that are slow to heal.  Past Medical History: Dr. White is a former smoker  having quit ten years ago after a smoking career of 40 years  averaging a pack/day. He has a history of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  previously managed with medication and lifestyle changes. John is obese with a BMI of 32 and suffers from type II diabetes  which is fairly well controlled with metformin. He has a history of hypertension  treated with lisinopril  as well as hypercholesterolemia  managed with statins. John had an MI (Myocardial Infarction) five years ago and underwent angioplasty with stenting.  Family History: His father died from stroke at the age of 75  and his mother had diabetes and died of breast cancer at 82. His older brother suffered an MI at 60 and has been diagnosed with PAD.   Social History: John is a widower and lives with his daughter and her family. He doesn't drink alcohol or use illicit substances. He has a diet high in fat and calories and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Relevant Findings: Physical examination reveals noticeable pallor and coolness in the right leg compared to the left. Additional findings include diminished pedal pulses  and notable atrophic skin changes in the right foot. These findings strongly point towards critical limb ischemia  which is further validated by an Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test showing an ABI < 0.4 in the right leg  indicating severe PAD. Further diagnostic testing is required to determine the extent of arterial blockage.    This patient representation accurately reflects a typical patient with CLI  according to the demographic data found in literature. It includes all the significant risk factors associated with CLI: advanced age  male sex  Caucasian race  smoking history  diabetes  obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  personal history of cardiovascular disease  and sedentary lifestyle with unhealthy diet.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,90,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Male  Age: 70 years  Race: Caucasian Current Residence: Urban area Occupation: Retired truck driver Socioeconomic Status: Lower-middle class   Medical History: 1) Ischemic heart disease: Patient has been suffering from ischemic heart disease for the past ten years and is on several cardiovascular medications including beta blockers  statins  and aspirin. 2) Diabetes: Diagnosed 15 years ago  patient has difficulty in maintaining glycemic control. He is on a combination of metformin and insulin. 3) Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  the patient is currently taking ACE inhibitors. 4) Smoking: A heavy smoker for 30 years  but quit 5 years ago.  5) Dyslipidemia: Patient has been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels  managed with statins. 6) Peripheral artery disease (PAD): Diagnosed high ankle-brachial index ratio 5 years ago. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy.  Presenting Complaint: Patient presents with constant  extreme pain in his lower right limb  worse when the limb is elevated  and improving when limb is placed in a dependent position. The pain is associated with non-healing ulcers on the foot. A noticeable paleness of the limb is observed. Patient has a history of walking impairment over the past year. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) reported significantly reduced.  Summary:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker with a history of cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes  dyslipidemia  hypertension  ischemic heart disease  and peripheral artery disease  now presents with rest pain  skin changes  and symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia on his right leg. This strongly suggests that the PAD has probably progressed to a more severe stage  characterized by insufficient blood flow leading to tissue loss.  Consideration: Overall  the individual's lifestyle habits  ongoing conditions  and medication usage should be taken into account in planning a management and treatment plan  including addressing potential medication interactions  lifestyle modifications  and potential surgical interventions  if necessary.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,91,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male. He is a heavy smoker with a 40-pack-year history. His weight is on the heavier side with a BMI of 32  classified as obesity. He lives in an urban setting and works as a taxi driver.  Medical History: In reviewing the patient's past medical history  it becomes evident that he has a history of several chronic conditions that have been mostly well-managed with medications. The patient has long-standing hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes metformin  and high cholesterol treated with statins. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed five years ago. Furthermore  the patient has had occasional intermittent claudication symptoms such as exertional leg pain that resolves with rest but has recently become more pronounced and persistent. He also complains of severe pain in his right foot even when at rest  especially during the night.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a significant reduction in the pulses of his right lower extremity. The skin reveals pallor when elevated and turns dusky when dependent. There is noticeable temperature difference between both legs with the right being cooler. Prompt rest pain and non-healing wounds on the right foot also suggest critical limb ischemia.   Problem summary: The patient's smoking habits  obesity  hypertension  high cholesterol  diabetes  and age raise the risk of developing severe peripheral artery disease and subsequently  critical limb ischemia. His African American ethnicity also predisposes him to peripheral artery disease. The deterioration in his conditions (constant pain  pallor  mottling  and non-healing wound) points to an existing critical limb ischemia case. This hypothesis can be further validated with diagnostic tests like Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  toe pressure measurements  or imaging studies like CT angiography  MR angiography  or conventional angiography.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,92,Problem Representation:  Patient: Ms. Jenkins is a 72-year-old African American woman living in a reduced-income  urban community in the United States.   Presenting Problem: She has been experiencing severe pain in her left leg  characterized by aching and burning  for the past two weeks. This pain is consistent over time  even when at rest. Additionally  she states that her toes have developed a bluish discoloration with sores that don’t seem to heal.  Relevant Past Medical History: Ms. Jenkins has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes for about 25 years  hypertension for around 20 years  and she has been a smoker for about 50 years. Her medications include Metformin and Lisinopril. She also experienced myocardial infarction 10 years back. She has undergone casual health checks sporadically  primarily due to lack of access to health services.  Background Information/ Demographics Risk Factor: African American women  particularly above age of 70  are at a statistically higher risk of developing peripheral artery disease (PAD) which can lead to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) especially when the challenge is compounded by other factors like diabetes  hypertension  and smoking history. Also  the disparity in healthcare accessibility could have delayed the diagnosis and treatment.  This presentation of severe pain  non-healing sores  and discoloration in her leg  along with her medical history  points towards a potential diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in Ms. Jenkins. It is a severe blockage in the arteries of her lower extremities  which significantly reduces blood flow and is a serious form of peripheral artery disease. This could represent a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,93,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: A patient  Mr. Smith  is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  as the prevalence of critical limb ischemia (CLI) tends to be higher in males and typically increase with age.  Past Medical History: He is a former heavy smoker and has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing with medication. His family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at an early age and his mother suffered from a stroke at an older age. He had previously undergone a successful coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) to treat severe coronary heart disease 7 years ago. He also suffers from diabetes mellitus type 2  which is reasonably controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally  he has been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years earlier. His BMI is 30 kg/m2 indicative of obesity.  Current Problem: Mr. Smith presents with a non-healing ulcer on his left lower leg  which has persisted for three months. He reports that initially  the wound's size was small but has significantly increased. He experiences severe pain in the limb  which intensifies at rest  particularly at night and it slightly alleviates when he dangles his leg off the bed. He has also noticed a considerable decrease in muscle strength in the affected limb and has difficulty moving his toes. It is also evident that there is decreased hair growth on the leg. The skin appears shiny  dry  and there are areas of dark discoloration. Besides  his pulses in the affected limb are diminished.  Given his past medical history and clinical presentation  he should be immediately evaluated for critical limb ischemia. His history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  diabetes mellitus  PAD  and coronary artery disease  along with age and male gender  make him at higher risk of developing CLI. He should be referred to a specialist vascular or endovascular surgeon for further diagnostic evaluation and management. His condition is urgent  as CLI not only affects limb survival but also overall survival.  A clinical plan would involve lower extremity angiography to assess the vascular anatomy and degree of occlusion. After confirmation of CLI  options such as endovascular intervention  bypass grafting  or amputation  depending on the case severity  should be considered.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,94,Patient Representation:  Patient: John Smith  Age: 70  Gender: Male   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Address: Houston  Texas.  Occupation: Retired  Presenting Issue: John reports severe pain in his right foot even when he is at rest. He states that his foot often feels cold  and his brother noticed his foot turning pale. He complains of sleep disruptions due to pain related to the symptoms.   Demographics: John fits within the typical demographic for critical limb ischemia  as this condition is often prevalent in older individuals  most commonly between 60 and 80 years. Males are also slightly more predisposed. Caucasian ethnic background also fits into the typical population affected by this disease. John is a veteran with lifestyle choices that might have contributed to his condition  such as tobacco use during military service years.   Medical History: The patient is a non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) case  with suboptimal control for the past 15 years. He has a history of hypertension and a few episodes of transient ischemic attacks over the year  managed currently with antiplatelets. John was also a heavy smoker before his TIA episodes and is currently an occasional smoker.  Family History: No early cardiac disease or stroke events in parents but early peripheral artery disease in his brother.  Social History: He is a veteran and has been exposed to various stressful environments. He lives with his wife in their own home. He is mostly sedentary and used to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day  gradually reduced to three cigarettes a day.  Risk Factors: Age  Male gender  Diabetes  Smoking  Hypertension  family history of atherosclerosis.  Conclusion: The severe foot pain during rest  coldness  and paleness could indicate critical limb ischemia due to peripheral artery disease  coinciding with his risk factors: age  male gender  longstanding uncontrolled diabetes  smoking history  and hypertension. He requires an urgent vascular consult to confirm the diagnosis and to optimize therapeutic options.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,95,Patient Profile:   Mr. A is a 70-year-old African-American male with a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. He recently retired from his job as an engineer. The patient is widowed  lives alone  and has two children who live out of state.  Problem Presentation:   Mr. A presented to the clinic with progressive pain in his right lower limb over the past few weeks. He characterizes the pain as deep-seated and unrelenting  which exacerbated on walking (claudication) but now is present at rest  especially at night. He also noticed the skin on his right foot becoming darker with coldness to touch and a non-healing wound.  Past Medical History:   1. Diabetes: Mr. A was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 15 years ago  and it is currently managed by Metformin and insulin therapy. His last HbA1c level three months ago was 7.5%.  2. Hypertension: He has been hypertensive for approximately ten years  controlled by a combination of Amlodipine and Lisinopril.   3. Hyperlipidemia: Since his early 50s  Mr. A has been taking Atorvastatin to manage this condition.   4. Smoking: Mr. A had been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day since his 20s until he quit five years ago.  5. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): Detected three years ago during Doppler studies  a consequence of his long-term smoking and diabetes. Initially managed with risk factor control and exercise.   Social History:   He lives alone with assistance from a caregiver who visits daily. His diet is sporadic and mostly convenience-based foods. He quit smoking 5 years ago but had a 50-year pack history. He consumes alcohol in moderation  usually 1-2 times per week. He is sedentary and doesn’t engage in any regular physical exercise.   Family History:  His father had an ischemic heart disease and died from a myocardial infarction in his early 70s. His mother lived until her late 80s and had a history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. His older brother had a stroke in his late 60s  and his two sisters are healthy.   Based on the patient's presentation  history  risk factors (including diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia)  and demographics (older adult  male  African-American)  a provisional diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is suspected. The progression of PAD due to uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  along with a heavy smoking history  could have led to this escalation. Essential tests like ankle-brachial index  imaging studies like CT angiography or MR angiography  and arteriography would be conducted to determine the extent of ischemia and plan treatment accordingly.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,96,Demographic Profile: Patient's name: Jane Doe Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Ethnic group: Caucasian Residence: Urban area Marital status: Widowed  The literature suggests that the incidence and prevalence of critical limb ischemia are higher in the elderly population  individuals of the Caucasian ethnic group  and individuals living in urban areas. The disease also seems to affect both males and females fairly equally.  Past Medical History: 1. Smoking: Jane has a history of heavy smoking  a risk factor for developing critical limb ischemia. 2. Diabetes: Jane has been living with type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years. 3. Cardiovascular Disease: She was diagnosed with coronary artery disease 10 years ago. 4. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): PAD diagnosis made 5 years ago. 5. Hypertension: Jane has had hypertension for over 12 years. 6. Hyperlipidemia: Jane has had chronically high cholesterol levels for the past decade. 7. Family History: She has a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Considering all these details  Jane is a typical patient who presents critical limb ischemia due to her demographic details and past medical history.   The above demographic details and medical history are consistent with the established risk factors for critical limb ischemia  which primarily affects older adults with histories of smoking  diabetes  peripheral artery and cardiovascular disease  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Critical limb ischemia is frequently found in individuals with a family history of cardiovascular diseases.

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,98,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Gender: Male Age: 75 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired manual worker  Presenting Problem:  The patient is reporting ongoing rest pain in his left leg for the past few months which has gradually increased in intensity. He states the pain worsens when lying down and slightly improves when he dangles his leg off the side of the bed. He has also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left foot.  Past Medical History:  - Coronary artery disease: The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has been managing his diabetes with diet control  metformin  and a sulfonylurea. - Hypertension: The patient has been on Losartan and a diuretic for this. - Hyperlipidemia: The patient is currently on atorvastatin. - History of smoking: The patient was a 30 pack-year smoker but quit 6 years ago after his heart surgery. - Family History: His father had peripheral artery disease.   Social History:   - The patient lives alone and is independently functioning. His daughter visits twice a week for general checkups.   Review of Systems:  - General: The patient appears fatigued and looks slightly underweight for his stature. - Cardiovascular: No complaints of chest pain  palpitation  or dyspnoea on exertion. - Respiratory: No history of cough or shortness of breath.   Physical Examination:  Lower Extremities: Skin appears shiny with hair loss  non-palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses on the left side. Skin temperature reduced in comparison to right leg. An ulcer about 3 cm in diameter with surrounding erythema is present on the left foot.  Assessment:  Based on the clinical presentation and past medical history  a preliminary diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is considered. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate management.  References:  - Nehler  M. R.  et al. (2003).

Critical Limb Ischemia,6,99,Patient Identifier: # Age: 73 Sex: Male Race: African American Location: Urban Area  Eastern USA  Presenting Condition: Critical Limb Ischemia  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension - Has been managing high blood pressure for about 15 years and it is under control with medication. 2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II - Diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with metformin and insulin therapy  not very well controlled  with episodes of hyperglycemia. 3. History of Smoking - Has been a smoker for 50 years  tried quitting multiple times but unsuccessful. 4. Coronary Artery Disease - Underwent heart bypass surgery 5 years ago. 5. Peripheral Artery Disease - Diagnosed 3 years ago.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient has been experiencing muscle pain and cramps in both legs  especially when walking (claudication). Noted an ulcer on his right lower leg which has been there for about 2 weeks and shows no signs of healing. Have been feeling progressively worsening rest pain in the foot at night or during rest  often disturbing his sleep even when the limb is elevated. His spouse noticed the leg was becoming colder and his foot was turning pale.  Family History: Father had heart disease and mother had diabetes. Two of four siblings have hypertension and one of them has diabetes.  Social History: Retired auto mechanic  married  lives with his wife. Continued to smoke about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day. Drinks alcohol occasionally. His diet is largely processed foods and he has a sedentary lifestyle.  Assessment: The above mentioned symptoms along with clinical and physical examination including non-healing wound  absent pulse (not palpable) and cold limb indicates severe stage of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)  i.e. Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His unsatisfactory control of diabetes and persistent smoking habits have contributed to the progression of PAD to CLI.   Given the severity of the disease and poor response to minimal invasive intervention in the past  patient may require more intense interventions which can include aggressive medical management  endovascular intervention  or even amputation. Immediate vascular consultation is required. Risk factor modification  especially smoking cessation  tight glycemic control  and introduction to healthy lifestyle habits  must be encouraged to prevent further progression and complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,6,100,Problem Representation:  I. Demographic information: - Gender: Substantial evidence suggests that critical limb ischemia is more common in males. For the purpose of developing rich patient representation  we will consider the patient to be an 80-year-old male. - Race: According to the literature  the prevalence is highest in Hispanic populations. Our patient is of Hispanic ethnicity. - Socioeconomic status: Lower socioeconomic status has been linked with higher prevalence of critical limb ischemia. Hence  the patient is considered to belong to a low-income group.  II. Relevant Past Medical History: - Smoking: The patient has been a smoker throughout his adult life. Literature suggests that smoking increases the risk of getting critical limb ischemia. - Diabetes: The patient was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus 20 years ago and is on regular medication. Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for developing critical limb ischemia. - Peripheral artery disease (PAD): The patient was diagnosed with PAD a decade ago. PAD is often a precursor to critical limb ischemia. - Hyperlipidemia: The patient has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglyceride levels)  which is another risk factor for the condition. - Kidney disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease  which has been correlated with higher risk of critical limb ischemia. - Hypertension: He has a long-standing history of hypertension  another potential risk factor.  To summarize  we have an 80-year-old  low-income male of Hispanic ethnicity who has a past medical history of smoking  diabetes  peripheral artery disease  hyperlipidemia  kidney disease  and hypertension. This patient currently presents with symptoms that suggest critical limb ischemia. This profile is consistent with the demographic characteristics and risk factors for critical limb ischemia identified in the literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,1,Case Report: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old African American Male Patient with a History of Diabetes Mellitus and Renal Fascicle  Patient Presentation: A 68-year-old African American male patient presented with complaints of rest pain in the right lower limb  especially at night  multiple non-healing ulcers on the right foot and reported a history of occasional claudication. The patient also had noticeable pallor  cold to touch  and decreased hair growth on the right leg.   Patient History: The patient has a past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) for the past 15 years  stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)  and hypertension. He declared that he had been a smoker for most of his adult life  only quitting at the age of 60  and he confessed to an irregular medication regimen due to forgetfulness.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed decreased pulses in the right femoral  popliteal  and foot arteries. Doppler ultrasound of the limb showed moderate stenosis in the femoral artery and occlusion of the popliteal artery. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was found to be less than 0.4 in the right leg.   Diagnosis:  The clinical findings  patient's symptology  and background were enough to support the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Management and Outcome:  The patient was emergently referred to a vascular surgeon for intervention. He underwent an angioplasty and stent placement in the right femoral artery  with concurrent initiation of anticoagulant therapy. He was also referred to diabetic education and a renal dietician for appropriate management of his chronic diseases. A four-week follow-up showed marked improvement in the pain levels and a decrease in the size of the ulcers with ABI improved to 0.6 on the right side. The patient was scheduled for continued follow-up every three months to monitor the stent patency  foot care  and the management of diabetes and renal disease.   Discussion:  Primary care providers should have a high index of suspicion and prompt recognition for CLI in patients presenting with non-healing ulcers  rest pain  particularly those with DM  CKD and previous smoking histories  as they represent a high-risk group. Close collaboration with specialists (such as vascular surgeons) and early intervention may result in limb salvage.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of early identification and proper interdisciplinary management of patients with CLI  particularly among the population with risk factors. Education and management  further reinforced by regular follow-ups  are fundamental in preventing the progression of CLI while also managing the underlying causative conditions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,2,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Female Patient with Long-Standing Diabetes Mellitus and Peripheral Arterial Disease  Case Report:  Patient Identification: Our patient is a 68-year-old African American female from an urban setting. She is a retired primary school teacher and lives with her supportive husband.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was presented to the emergency department with rest pain and non-healing ulcers on her left lower leg  which had been persisting for the past three weeks.  Medical History:  The patient has been living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) for over 20 years and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents. She was previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) six years ago but did not have regular follow-ups. She also has a history of hypertension  controlled through medication. There was no known history of smoking  but she had a social history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Examination: Upon physical examination  her left lower leg had ischemic skin changes  characterized by hair loss (alopecia)  shininess  and a cool temperature compared to her right lower leg. There were two non-healing ulcers at her left dorsum foot and at the posterior medial aspect of her lower leg. Both ulcers had a pale base with minimal exudate and surrounding erythema. The patient's left foot pulses  including her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial  were not palpable.  Investigations: Laboratory investigations showed uncontrolled hyperglycemia with an elevated HbA1c level at 9.5%  suggesting poor diabetes control. The patient’s lipid profile was also abnormal. Ankle-brachial index (ABI)  performed to evaluate the severity of the PAD  indicated critical limb ischemia with an ABI of 0.4. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the PAD  demonstrating significant stenosis in the left lower extremity.  Management: The patient was admitted and initially started on systemic antibiotic therapy due to signs of a superimposed infection on the ulcers. With her ABI and symptoms  our vascular surgeon recommended lower limb angiography  followed by possible intervention. She was also referred to a diabetic nurse specialist for optimization of her diabetes management.  Summary:  This case epitomizes the typical disease course of uncontrolled DM leading to late complications  such as PAD and ultimately  critical limb ischemia. It emphasizes the significance of optimal diabetes control for preventing vascular complications and highlights the importance of regular follow-ups in patients with PAD.  This report addresses an African American patient  whose demographic is often underrepresented in literature but overrepresented in raw data for peripheral arterial disease and diabetes populations  thus highlighting the importance of addressing ethnic disparities in healthcare. Future research should focus on reducing such disparities to offer optimal care for diverse patient populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,3,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-year-old Caucasian Female with Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus  Patient Information:  A 72-year-old Caucasian female.  Reason of Hospitalization: The patient was admitted to the hospital due to unbearable pain in the left lower limb. The pain was continuous and noticeably increased upon movement.  Chief Complaints: Unremitting pain in the left lower limb  which became worse upon elevation. The patient also noted the skin in this area looked paler than the rest of her body and had a cold to touch feeling.  Medical History: The patient has a substantial history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  uncontrolled and diagnosed 15 years ago. Her sugars measured on an average between 180-200 mg/dL  with occasional reports going above 250 mg/dL. She has been prescribed insulin but admits to irregular administration. Other medical histories include hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and former tobacco use  which she quit 10 years ago.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient’s left foot was pale with signs of peripheral cyanosis  low temperature  and loss of hair on the limb. Pulse was absent on the dorsalis pedis and popliteal arteries  and weak at the femoral artery.  Lab Results: Blood work revealed an elevated fasting blood sugar level of 220 mg/dL and a HbA1c of 8.3%. The lipid profile was abnormal with a higher level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.4 in the left leg indicating severe peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Imaging Results: Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) showed extensive calcification and blockages in the arterial tree of the lower limb  especially the left superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. A runoff study also revealed compromised flow in the tibial arteries.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's history  physical examination  lab results  as well as imaging studies  she was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of PAD.  Treatment Procedure: The patient was counselled about her diagnosis and recommended for a revascularization procedure. After discussing the risks and benefits  the patient consented for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the left leg arteries. An initial plain balloon angioplasty of the left femoral-popliteal arteries was performed  which resulted in significant improvement of the blood flow.  Follow Up and Prognosis: The prognosis of CLI is generally poor due to the advanced nature of the disease and associated comorbidities. The patient was counselled about the importance of preventing recurrence with aggressive control of diabetes  dyslipidemia and antiplatelet therapy. A rehabilitation program  including exercise and foot care was recommended. She was scheduled for regular check-ups to monitor her condition and the effectiveness of the therapy.  Conclusion: This case report emphasizes the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of CLI  especially in patients with a long history of uncontrolled diabetes. It also highlights the need for patient education on maintaining regular insulin therapy  optimising glycaemic control and sustainable lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of PAD progression.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,4,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Elderly Diabetic Patient: Assessment  Management and Outcomes  I. Patient Information   The patient is a 75-year-old African American male who was admitted to the hospital with severe pain in his lower right limb  which had been worsening over the past six months. The assessment also indicated that he had non-healing ulcers on the right foot. The patient lived alone and was retired. No history of alcohol or substance abuse was recorded.  II. Medical History  The patient had a long-standing history of type II diabetes along with hypertension  obesity  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He had a 30-pack year smoking history but quit smoking around 15 years ago. He was on insulin  antihypertensives  aspirin  and statins for his existing conditions. His previous treatments for PAD included angioplasty and stent placements  but his symptoms had gradually worsened  leading towards the current events.  III. Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient’s right foot was cold to touch and had a bluish discoloration  suggestive of cyanosis  with palpable sciatic but non-palpable distal pulses. Ankle-brachial index was evaluated to be less than 0.4. He had a BMI of 35  indicative of obesity. Apart from his lower limb  physical examinations were unremarkable.   IV. Investigations  The initial laboratory tests revealed a high white cell count and an elevated C-reactive protein  indicating inflammation or possible infection. Fasting blood sugar level was 210 mg/dl and HbA1c was 8.6%  indicative of uncontrolled diabetes. The patient was tested negative for COVID-19. Imaging included duplex ultrasonography which demonstrated significant blockage in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. A lower extremity angiogram further confirmed severe multi-segment arterial disease.  V. Treatment  The patient was initially managed with intravenous antibiotics  strict glycemic control  and analgesics. A multidisciplinary foot team was convened and after assessing the patient's condition and potential risks for intervention  a decision was made to perform a bypass operation. After the surgery  the patient was managed with regular wound care  and his medications were reviewed and regulated as per the requirements.   VI. Outcome and Follow-up  Post-operative recovery was fair  with marked improvement in the patient’s foot pain. However  wound healing was slow presumably due to the longstanding diabetes. Patient was scheduled for regular follow-up visits for assessment and dressing of his ulcers  and a home-care nursing service was arranged for the interim period. Regular diabetes care including dietary advice was provided  and behavioral therapy was also recommended to encourage the patient towards a healthier lifestyle.  This case highlights the importance of early detection  multidisciplinary management  and close follow-up of patients with critical limb ischemia  particularly those with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. Prompt diagnosis and immediate intervention can help to prevent severe complications  including limb amputation or even fatal outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,5,Title: A Case Report on Critical Limb Ischemia in a 70-Year-old White Male with a History of Diabetes and Smoking   Abstract:   This case report describes a Caucasian male patient aged 70 who presented with critical limb ischemia complicated by long-term diabetes and a history of smoking.   Case Presentation:  Mr. Robert is a 70-year-old male of Caucasian ethnicity with an established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled for more than 10 years. He hailed from a small suburban town and was an active smoker  with a history of 30-pack years.   He was brought in by his son with a three-week history of rest pain in his right lower extremity  particularly at night  coupled with non-healing ulcers on his right foot and lower leg. The pain had escalated over the past seven days  resulting in extreme discomfort and inability to walk. He had not been experiencing any chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or fainting spells.  Past Medical History:  His medical history was significant for a long-term battle with a poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral arterial disease  and hypertension. He had been on metformin (1000mg twice daily) and insulin (10 units at night). For his hypertension  he was on amlodipine (5mg daily). His lipid profile showed high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels  which were managed through atorvastatin (20mg daily).  Initial Diagnosis and Treatment:  Upon examination  the right limb was visibly pale  cold to touch  with diminished pedal pulses. Acute critical limb ischemia (CLI) was suspected  hence multi-modal non-invasive vascular imaging involving an ankle-brachial index (ABI) and contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography were performed and confirmed severe peripheral artery disease with right lower extremity occlusions.  He was subsequently started on intravenous Heparin for anticoagulation  and high-intensity statin therapy was initiated for lipid management. However  considering the evidence of severe unrelieved ischemia and infection of the leg ulcers  the patient was counseled for an urgent endovascular revascularization procedure.  Conclusion:  This case exemplifies the relationship between poorly managed diabetes  smoking  and the onset of critical limb ischemia  underlining the importance of these risk factors in the pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease. An early diagnosis and appropriate medical intervention are crucial to prevent limb loss and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality in such cases. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,6,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in Elderly Latino Female Patient with Past Medical History of Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension   Patient Information: The patient is an 80-year-old Latino female who resides in an Urban center of California in the United States. A Spanish-speaking monolingual patient  she has been living with her eldest son and his family following the demise of her husband ten years back.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the last 15 years and essential hypertension for 20 years. She has attended regular follow-ups for these conditions and has been managed on Metformin 500mg twice a day  Lisinopril 20mg once a day  and Amlodipine 10mg once a day. She was non-smoker and non-alcoholic and had no known allergies. There was no known familial history of cardiovascular diseases.   Presenting Complaints and Examination: The patient was brought to the emergency department with complaints of severe rest pain in the lower legs  intermittent claudication  and discoloration of the skin (from her knees down to her feet). On examination  both feet were cold with delayed capillary refill time. There were ulcers over her left heel and right great toe. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable in both lower extremities. Ankle-brachial index was undetectably low.  Diagnostic Intervention and Results: An immediate ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was obtained and was less than 0.40 on left and right. Three-phase Bone Scintigraphy showed an absence of perfusion and blood pooling in both lower limbs. Additional imaging included Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)  indicating extensive atherosclerotic changes in the infra-renal aorta  both common iliac arteries  femoral arteries and both the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) likely secondary to her poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. She was started on aspirin 75mg  a statin  and cilostazol 100mg twice daily. After consultation with the vascular surgery team  a decision to perform bilateral lower limb bypass surgeries was made. The patient was informed and explained thoroughly about the procedure in her native language. Her son gave consent on her behalf as she was deemed unfit due to poor mental state.  Follow Up and Outcomes: The patient tolerated the surgical procedure well  and her post-operative period was uneventful. As part of her post-operative care  she was prescribed a stringent blood glucose control regimen which was closely monitored. Repeat ABPI done six weeks post-surgery was > 0.90 on both sides. She responded well to the treatment and reported significant pain relief and improved movements at the two-month follow-up. The discoloration of her feet had also become much less conspicuous.   Patient Perspective:  Despite the language barrier  the patient expressed gratitude to the medical team for relieving her of the immense pain she was dealing with.  Conclusion: This case report illustrates the severe outcome of chronic uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension leading to critical limb ischemia in an aged Latino woman. It also underscores the importance of close monitoring  better control of underlying conditions  and the role of timely surgical intervention in the management of CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,7,Title: Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in a 58-year-old Hispanic Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe peripheral artery disease that threatens limb viability. Characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene  CLI requires prompt treatment to prevent severe outcomes  including amputation or death. Highlighted herein is a case of CLI in a 58-year-old Hispanic male patient.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 58-year-old Hispanic male from a rural community in New Mexico  USA. He presented with a seven-week history of severe  continuous right lower leg pain primarily at rest  non-healing ulcerations on his big toe and the distal part of the foot. He is a 40 pack-year smoker  has type II diabetes well controlled with metformin  and a known diagnosis of hypertension treated with lisinopril. He also reported intermittent claudication after walking 50-60 meters. His body mass index was within norm (24.5 kg/m2). No allergies were documented. Family history revealed premature heart disease in his father.  On physical examination  the foot was pale and cool to touch with decreased hair growth. Pedal pulses were absent  and distal sensation was significantly reduced. The ulceration on the big toe was about 2 cm in diameter with some necrotic tissue  showing signs of infection.   Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity revealed poor distal flow with monophasic waveforms. The Ankle-brachial index was 0.4  confirming severe arterial disease. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated significant atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal portion of the right popliteal artery and its branches.  Management and Outcome: In virtue of CLI diagnosis  the patient underwent successful stenting of the right popliteal artery. His postoperative period was uncomplicated  with significant improvements noted in the follow-up visits. Oxycodone was prescribed for pain relief  and antibiotics were given to control infection. On follow-up examination at 12 weeks  the patient's foot ulcer showed significant healing  and limb pain was significantly reduced.   Conclusion: Critical limb ischemia  as illustrated by this case  can cause significant morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate interventions are crucial. Lifestyle modification  strict glycemic control  and cessation of smoking are also essential for long-term outcomes. This case signifies the importance of comprehensive vascular assessment in patients with certain risk factors such as aging  smoking  diabetes  and hypertension.

The patient lives with her husband  is a retired teacher  has Medicare  and is overall ambulatory with the help of a walking cane.   Presenting Complaint:  She complained of an onset of persistent rest pain in her right lower limb that disturbs her sleep. Along with the pain  she had noticed an increasing discoloration of her toes over the past three weeks. The patient also mentioned a history of non-healing ulcer on her second toe for around one month.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a ten-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which is managed with metformin and regular insulin injections. She also has peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed five years back  maintained on aspirin and lipid-lowering drugs. She is a former smoker  having quit 20 years back  and has mild hypertension controlled with medication. In the past  she had a transient ischemic attack with complete recovery and no known allergies.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the right foot was cooler than the other  with diminished sensation. Peripheral pulses in the right lower limb were faintly palpable  while the skin of the right foot and shin was shiny and showed a dusky discoloration. An ulcer  approximately 1.5cm in diameter  was present on the dorsum of the second toe which was associated with underlying necrotic tissue.  Investigation Findings:  Laboratory workup demonstrated HbA1c of 7.9%  indicating suboptimal glycemic control. Lipid profile showed the patient's low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as high. Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was significantly reduced at 0.35. Doppler ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the patient's right superficial femoral artery.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings  the history of diabetes and PAD  and supported by non-invasive vascular studies  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Treatment & Follow-up:  The patient was advised for immediate hospitalization. Following multidisciplinary discussions between the vascular surgeons  podiatrist  and endocrinologists  she underwent revascularization via angioplasty. Post-operative period was uneventful  and a marked improvement was seen in limb perfusion. Post surgeries  the right foot was warmer  with the color having returned to near normal.  The patient was enrolled in a comprehensive diabetes management program to optimize her HbA1c levels and manage her peripheral arterial disease  which included nutritional counseling  foot care education  and adjustments in her medication for better glycemic control.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the successful management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a patient with a significant medical history.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,9,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old with Diabetes and History of Smoking  Abstract: This case report describes a 72-year-old African American male with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and long-term smoking  who presented with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  highlighting the importance of early detection and prompt management of CLI in high-risk populations.  Case Description:  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male  with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin for the past 10 years. He is a self-reported smoker for 50 years  averaging one pack per day and has a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He denied alcohol consumption and illegal drug use. The patient's family history contains significant incidents of cardiovascular diseases.  Clinical Findings and Timeline: This patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of rest pain and non-healing ulcers on the left lower limb that had persisted for the past few weeks. He also reported changes in skin color to a purplish hue and coldness of the foot. These symptoms were progressively worsening and disturbing his sleep.  Diagnostic Assessment: On physical examination  the left foot was cold with weak pulses  and two non-healing ulcers were found. One ulcer located on the plantar surface of the foot measured approximately 2 cm in diameter; another ulcer on the medial aspect of the left ankle measured 1 cm. Duplex ultrasound showed reduced blood flow in the left lower limb. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia revealing multiple significant stenoses in the left common and external iliac  superficial femoral  and popliteal arteries. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels were noted to be elevated at 200 mg/dL and 7.9%  respectively.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent successful endovascular revascularization  including angioplasty and stent placement for the affected vessels. His blood sugar control was managed by intensifying his anti-diabetic regimen with the addition of insulin therapy. He was also given smoking cessation counseling and prescribed medications to help quit smoking.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Post-intervention  there was improved blood circulation in the left lower limb with significant relief from rest pain. His ulcers registered noticeable improvements over the subsequent weeks of follow-up. The patient was readmitted after six months due to non-compliance to anti-diabetics and had high glucose levels noted. There was no recurrence of CLI.  Patient’s Perspective: The patient was relieved with the resolution of pain and expressed his regret for not quitting smoking earlier. He acknowledged the importance of managing his diabetes and gave assurance of adherence in the future.  Conclusion: CLI can cause significant morbidity if left undiagnosed or untreated  primarily in high-risk groups such as long term smokers and diabetic patients. This case highlights the importance of early detection and prompt revascularization in managing CLI and the need for strict glycemic control and smoking cessation to avoid recurrence. It also emphasizes the need for effective patient education and adherence to lifelong lifestyle modifications. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,10,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 66-year-old Hispanic Male   Demographic Information  Patient identifies as a 66-year-old Hispanic male currently living alone. He is a retired factory worker and a widower with two adult children. The patient is a long-term smoker with a 40-pack year history and  despite numerous advice  continues to smoke at least half a pack daily. His body mass index falls within the obese range (BMI of 31). He is bilingual  but prefers to communicate in Spanish and has a high school level of education. His current fiscal situation is low-middle class.   Past Medical History The patient has a significant clinical past medical history. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago  which remains sub-optimally controlled with glycaemic indicators HbA1c consistently > 8%. He suffers from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed three years ago  which has shown continued progression despite a combination of pharmacotherapy and supervised exercise program.  The patient also has a history of hypertension  under treatment for the last eight years  and dyslipidemia  under control through diet and medication. Four years ago  he suffered a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is on dual anti-platelet therapy since then.  Presenting Condition The patient presented to vascular clinic following referral from the diabetes service due to increasing pain in his right foot over the past two months. The pain is persistent but critically worsens at nighttime. He has developed ulcerated lesions on his toes that are not showing any signs of healing.  Examination and Diagnosis Clinical examination revealed a cold right foot with diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right foot exhibited a dusky discoloration indicative of cyanosis. Doppler Ultrasound confirmed right distal artery stenosis with severely compromised blood flow and ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.45  suggestive of severe PAD. The above clinical presentation in conjunction with Doppler confirmation led to the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  In view of the obesity  uncontrolled diabetes  persistent smoking  and existing cardiovascular problems  he is at high risk for limb loss and increased mortality. He has been recommended for an immediate intervention for revascularization and aggressive management of his risk factors.  This case reiterates that CLI is a serious condition  prevalent in elderly  Hispanic  and male populations that are smoking dominated. Being a late manifestation of PAD  it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hence  the patient's behavioral modification and rigorous treatment of underlying comorbidities become instrumental in clinical management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,11,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-Year-Old Female with History of Diabetic Type 2- A Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American female presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of severe pain and non-healing ulcers in her right lower extremity. The patient resides in an urban low-income neighborhood in uptown New York. She's retired  lives alone  and is managed by her daughter.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus approximately ten years ago. Sub-optimal control of her diabetes was noticeable due to her poor compliance with her diabetic medication (Metformin  500mg BID) due to socio-economic barriers. She has significant history of hypertension controlled by Lisinopril (10mg QD)  hyperlipidemia managed by atorvastatin (20mg QD)  and top of moderate chronic kidney disease. The patient also reported being a former smoker  she smoked about a pack a day over a span of 30 years before quitting five years ago. She denied any history of substance abuse.  Recent Clinical History: Examination led to the findings of diminished pulses and coldness in the right foot along with ischemic skin changes such as trophic changes in nails and skin  and non-healing ulcers over the lateral aspect of her right foot. Additionally  ankle-brachial index (ABI)  a diagnostic test used for peripheral artery disease (PAD)  showed a value less than 0.3 in the right lower extremity indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI). A color-Doppler ultrasound revealed significant blockages in the femoral and popliteal arteries on the right side.  Treatment and Outcome: This concluded that the patient was suffering from CLI due to severe PAD  a common yet severe complication seen in long-term diabetes. Subsequently  the patient underwent endovascular treatment which included balloon angioplasty and stenting of the blocked arteries which led to an improvement in her symptoms. She was then put on antiplatelet medication and statins in addition to optimizing her diabetes and blood pressure medications.  Conclusion: This case highlights the necessity for early detection and treatment of PAD in diabetes to prevent progression to CLI. Improving access to healthcare and ensuring adherence to treatments can greatly reduce the risk of severe complications in underprivileged communities. Furthermore  it also illustrates the interconnected relationship of non-compliance due to social determinants of health and poor prognoses in chronic conditions. Data indicates a high prevalence of PAD among African-American females due to a higher incidence of risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension and smoking. Hence  targeted interventions in such demographic groups may also aid in reducing the burden. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,12,Title: Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Female with History of Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Case Report  INTRODUCTION  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the severe form of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)  is often detected in elderly populations with high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. This case report describes a patient with pre-existing PAD presenting with severe CLI.  CASE REPORT  Patient Details:  Mrs. X is an 81-year-old Caucasian female from a rural area  presenting in the emergency department with complaints of persistent pain in her right lower leg  foot ulceration  and a visible skin color change.  Medical History:  The patient has a notable history of long-standing hypertension  hyperlipidemia  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  previous transient ischemic attack (TIA)  and was diagnosed with PAD ten years prior. She has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 15 years ago. She was on regular medications including antihypertensives  statins  and oral hypoglycemic agents.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the right leg appeared pale with delayed capillary refill. An infected  painful  non-healing ulcer of three weeks' duration was noted on the lateral aspect of her right foot  along with gangrenous changes of the great toe. Loss of distal pulses in the affected limb was also noted.   Diagnostic Assessments:  Laboratory findings showed elevated leukocyte count and C-reactive protein  indicating systemic inflammation. Duplex ultrasound confirmed the absence of arterial flow in the right femoral  popliteal  and tibial arteries  suggesting a severe blockage. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was below 0.4  strongly supporting the diagnosis.   Therapeutic Interventions:  The multi-disciplinary team opted for emergent revascularization. She underwent a successful femoral-tibial bypass surgery. The gangrenous toe was amputated. Post-operative recovery was complicated by wound infection  managed with systemic antibiotics.  Outcomes:  Despite numerous setbacks  Mrs. X showed improvement with reduced pain and no further progression of ischemia. She received rehabilitation and instructions on foot care. Long-term antiplatelet and statin therapy were continued.  Discussion:  This case highlights the complexity and significant cardiovascular risk in patients having PAD  which may cause CLI. Aggressive multi-factor cardiovascular risk management is crucial.   Conclusion: Early identification of PAD  aggressive risk factor modification  patient education  and appropriate intervention can substantially improve the outcomes and decrease the risk of amputation in patients with CLI.   Patient Consent: Informed consent was taken from the patient for the treatment procedure and publication of the case report. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,13,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which significantly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. CLI is often found in the elderly population  smokers  and people with diabetes.  Patient Information: The patient is an 83-year-old African American male with a past medical history of type-2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking (40 pack years)  and previous transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot.  Clinical findings: The patient presented in the clinic complaining of excruciating pain in his right lower leg  consistent with rest pain. He had a non-healing ulcer (2 cm in diameter) on his right heel present for 2 months. Examination revealed an absent right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. The right foot was cool  with loss of hair on the toes and shiny atrophic skin. A femoral pulse was palpable on the right side.   Diagnostic Assessment: Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) Score was found to be 0.5 on the right side indicating severe arterial disease. Duplex ultrasound showed significant stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and occlusion of all three infrapopliteal arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention: Given the patient's age  co-morbidities  and arterial disease's severity  the decision was to initiate conservative management with analgesics  stringent glycemic control  stop smoking  and regular dressings for the ulcer. The patient was not suitable for surgery (revascularization or amputation) given his comorbidities and ASA score of 4.   Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient’s pain was managed effectively with analgesics. His foot ulcer  however  only showed minor improvements after 1 month of conservative treatment. Given the persistent ischemia and risk of systemic infection  the patient was counseled about an above-the-knee amputation. However  he refused any surgical intervention. The patient opted for palliative care and was referred to the palliative care team.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed understanding of his medical condition and its poor prognosis. He emphasized his wish to avoid major surgeries  preferring comfort and quality of life even if it meant living with CLI. His family supported his decision.  Informed Consent:  The patient's consent was taken before submitting this case report.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the difficult decisions that arise in managing patients with CLI who are not suitable candidates for surgical intervention. Bundled conservative measures may temporarily alleviate symptoms  but the prognosis remains generally poor without revascularization. This case also underlines the need for more research to find better conservative interventions for CLI in elderly  multi-morbid patients. Furthermore  diabetes being a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and eventual CLI demands stringent sugar control and regular foot care in these patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,14,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 64-Year-Old African-American Female with a History of Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension.  Abstract: We report a case of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a 64-year-old African-American female with a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension. Despite the complexities involved in treatment  the patient showed significant improvement with the combined approach of revascularization surgery and rigorous control of her blood sugar and blood pressure levels.  Case Presentation: Ms. A  a 64-year-old African-American female presented to the vascular clinic with a two-month history of severe  continuous pain in her right lower limb  primarily in the foot which worsened at night. She reported unhealed sores on her right foot. The patient had a long-standing history of T2DM  for which she was taking metformin; and hypertension  controlled with ACE inhibitors. However  the patient reported non-compliance with medication and diet.  Physical examination revealed signs consistent with CLI: palpable but weak femoral pulse  non-palpable popliteal and foot pulses  cool skin  and hair loss on the lower leg. Her right foot showed ulcerations on the heel and great toe  evidence of necrotic tissue  and no signs of infection.  Investigations: Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurement was critically low. Subsequent Doppler ultrasound confirmed severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) with multiple occlusions and stenosis in superficial femoral  popliteal  and tibial arteries. Blood sugar levels were high  and HbA1c was 9.6%  indicative of poor glycemic control. Blood pressure was also raised.  Management: Initial treatment was focused on control of T2DM and hypertension. The patient was switched to insulin for better glycemic control and her hypertension medication was adjusted. For the treatment of CLI  the patient underwent revascularization surgery which included a femoropopliteal bypass graft.  Outcome and Follow-Up: There was a significant improvement in the symptoms post-revascularization surgery. Tissue healing of her ulcers was observed at one-month follow-up and completely healed by the third month. Blood sugar and blood pressure levels were well regulated. The patient was advised to maintain strict medication compliance and follow a diabetic diet. Regular follow-ups were recommended for the ongoing management of diabetes and hypertension  as well as for early detection of possible future complications.  Discussion: This case underscores the importance of maintaining good control over T2DM and hypertension  both of which are known risk factors for PAD  and by extension  CLI. Early recognition of the symptoms and intervention in such patients can potentially prevent or delay debilitating complications such as limb amputation. Regular follow-ups  medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of managing such cases.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,15,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-year-old Male with Uncontrolled Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the most severe form of peripheral artery disease with poor prognosis and high mortality. Diabetes and renal disease are common comorbid conditions associated with CLI.  Patient Information:   We present a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a former smoker and residing in an urban setting. His medical history includes uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for the past 20 years  and Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) stage-3 resulting in intermittent hemodialysis for the last five years. He presented to our vascular surgery department with a six-month history of rest pain and non-healing ulcer on his left foot. His BMI was recorded as 27.5 Kg/m^2. He lives alone and is fully independent.   Clinical Findings:   Physical examination revealed a cold left foot with an evident  non-healing ulcer (2cm x 2cm) on the dorsal aspect  near the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint. His left pedal pulses were absent  while right foot pulses were palpable but reduced. Pain was accentuated at rest and worsened when the limb was elevated.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  registering under 0.4 on the left side  indicating severe ischemia. Duplex Ultrasound Scan (DUS) of the lower limb arteries confirmed multilevel occlusive disease with significant stenosis in the left superficial femoral and popliteal arteries  along with occlusion of the anterior tibial artery. Blood tests also showed elevated levels of HbA1C and serum creatinine  indicating uncontrolled diabetes and worsening renal function  respectively.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initiated on aggressive wound care along with optimization of his diabetes and renal functions. After multi-disciplinary team discussions and informed consent  the patient underwent successful endovascular treatment revascularization for his left limb with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the stenosed segments.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient had an uneventful post-operative period with significantly improved rest pain. Repeat ABI showed improvement to 0.78. At the three months follow-up  his wound showed considerable healing  and no further surgical intervention was required. His diabetes and kidney disease were managed with insulin and appropriate modifications in his dialysis prescription.  Patient Perspective:  The patient confided that the pain was debilitating  limiting his mobility and thus  his independence. He was grateful for the intervention which alleviated his suffering and improved his quality of life.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of prompt recognition and aggressive management of CLI  especially in patients with comorbid diabetes and renal impairment. It also highlights the key role of endovascular revascularization as a viable treatment option for appropriately selected patients with CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,16,Title: A Case of Rapidly Progressing Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Diabetic Patient  Demographic Information: Patient: Mr. James Thompson Age: 72 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Marital Status: Widowed Occupation: Retired Factory Worker Insurance Status: Medicare Living Situation: Lives alone but has consistent home care support Tobacco Use: Former smoker (stopped 10 years ago) Alcohol Use: Light drinker (occasionally)  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with severe pain in the lower left limb  especially at rest. The pain started gradually over 6 months  progressively worsening over recent weeks to the point where Mr. Thompson had trouble sleeping. His left foot appeared discolored  nearly purplish  and colder than the right foot. There were non-healing ulcers on his left toe.  Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history including: - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 25 years - Hypertension for 20 years - Coronary Artery Disease with myocardial infarction 10 years ago - Peripheral Arterial Disease diagnosed 8 years ago - History of chronic renal disease He is currently on metformin  lisinopril  metoprolol  and aspirin.  Clinical Findings:  Peripheral pulses including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries were absent in the left leg. There was discoloration and temperature asymmetry between both limbs. Painful non-healing ulcers were present on the tip of the left great toe. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) for the left leg was 0.4 (normal ABI range 1.0-1.4).  Diagnosis: Given the patient’s clinical findings  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the severe stage of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).  Management and Outcome: Mr. Thompson was immediately initiated on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin and underwent a successful left lower limb angioplasty and stent placement. The vascular surgical team was consulted for evaluation and wound care specialists for managing his foot ulcer. Comorbidities were optimized with essential medication adjustments.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and management of CLI  especially in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes  hypertension  and history of peripheral and coronary artery disease. Timely aggressive intervention can prevent limb amputation and improve outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,17,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-Year-Old Male with Prior History of Smoking and Diabetes Mellitus  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to a 40-year history of smoking  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease. He is a retired factory worker and lives with his wife in rural Nebraska. He admits to an occasional consumption of alcohol.  Presenting Concerns: The patient presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of worsening rest pain in his right lower limb. He also reported the presence of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot  which he first noticed about a month ago. Upon examination  there was an evident decrease in peripheral pulses in the right limb and the leg was cool to touch with a visible necrotic lesion on the foot.  Investigations: The patient's resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.4 in the right leg and 0.9 in the left leg (normal is 1.0-1.4)  confirming lower limb ischemia. An angiogram revealed long segment occlusions of both the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries on the right side. Laboratory investigations showed poorly controlled diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1C of 9.5% and a mildly elevated creatinine level indicating possible nephropathy. An EKG showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes.   Diagnosis: Considering his medical history  physical exam findings  ABI values  and angiographic report  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was confirmed.  Treatment and Outcome: The vascular surgery team recommended a right lower limb bypass surgery given the severity of the ischemia and the presence of tissue loss. In addition  his diabetes management was escalated with the addition of insulin to his oral hypoglycemics  his antihypertensive medications were adjusted  and effort was relentlessly put into his smoking cessation education. The patient consented to the treatment plan and underwent successful revascularization.   His post-operative course was complicated by a chest infection  likely secondary to his chronic COPD and recent smoking history  which was managed successfully with antibiotics. Postoperatively  his foot ulcer began showing signs of healing and his rest pain gradually improved.  Take-home message: This case highlights the significant impact of risk factors such as smoking and poorly controlled diabetes on the development of critical limb ischemia. It emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive risk factor management in preventing major adverse limb events in patients with peripheral artery disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,18,Title: Management of Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in a 70-year-old Male Patient with a Long-Term Smoking History  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe clinical presentation of peripheral artery disease (PAD) that is accompanied by severe resting pain  chronic non-healing ulcers  and/or gangrene in the affected limb. We report a case of a 70-year-old man presenting with CLI involving the right lower limb.  Case Presentation: A 70-year-old African American man  retired dock worker  visited the vascular clinic with complaints of severe  persistent pain in his right lower limb. He also presented with large  non-healing ulcers on his right foot and ankle  which had been worsening over the past six months. He reported a history of 50 pack-years (a measurement of smoking intensity) and hypertension. He denied any prior history of PAD  coronary artery disease  or cerebrovascular accidents. The patient lives alone  does not drink alcohol but has a long history of tobacco use  and is only conveniently mobile within his house due to pain.  Examination revealed a significantly diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse in the right foot. Nevertheless  the left foot had regular pulses. Critical limb ischemia was suspected based on the clinical features and history.  Investigations: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed for both limbs. The right limb ABI was found to be significant at 0.4 (normal range: 1–1.4). Furthermore  vascular duplex ultrasonography and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) identified severe stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and multiple occlusions in the distal right popliteal artery  confirming the diagnosis of CLI. A complete blood count  metabolic panel  and lipid panel showed stable diabetic control  kidney function  and a slightly elevated cholesterol level  respectively.  Treatment: The patient was started on an optimized medical therapy including aspirin  a statin  and an antihypertensive medication. Owing to the critical nature of the ischemia and poor response to conservative treatment  the patient was referred for revascularization. A right superficial femoral artery stenting was performed. Post-procedure  he experienced significant relief from the severe pain.  The patient was also provided with extensive wound care for his non-healing foot ulcers  along with strict instructions to quit smoking.   Follow-Up: Follow-up at one and three months post-treatment revealed significant healing of his foot ulcers. ABI measurement was also performed  which improved to 0.9 in the right limb. Further control of his hypertension and dyslipidemia was achieved.  Conclusion: This case serves to underscore the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment of CLI in symptomatic patients  especially smokers. Patient adherence with intense wound care  strict tobacco cessation instruction  aspirin  statin  and antihypertensive therapy  along with successful revascularization can contribute to CLI management and prolong limb survival.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,19,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 63-year-old African American Male with Long-Standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Peripheral Arterial Disease  Case Presentation:  Patient Details: A 63-year-old African American male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (diagnosed 15 years ago)  controlled hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed 3 years ago. He has a long history of smoking  amounting to a pack per day for the past 30 years but had quit smoking two months back. He is an alcohol consumer but in moderation. Family history includes a father who suffered from stroke and mother with T2DM.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with an escalating pain in the right lower limb  primarily in the calf and foot region  noticeable at rest and disturbing his sleep. He also noticed some non-healing ulcers on his right foot and evidence of tissue loss in the form of gangrene involving the distal phalanx of the right great toe.  Clinical Examination: The clinical examination revealed a decreased popliteal and absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the right side  but feeble in the left lower limb. There was loss of hair growth on the right lower limb  a sign of chronic ischemia. The patient's right foot was cooler than the left  with multiple small non-healing ulcers and ischemic changes were evident with a pressure ulcer on the heel. Also present was a black  mummified right great toe (dry gangrene).  Investigations: Complete blood count  renal function test  and HbA1c were done. Duplex ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in the lower limbs  revealing extensive atherosclerotic changes. A computerized tomography angiogram highlighted critical stenoses in the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery with reconstitution of tibial vessels through collateral circulation.  Diagnosis and Management: A diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to poorly controlled T2DM and PAD was made. The patient underwent angioplasty with stenting of the right superficial femoral artery. His Diabetes mellitus was managed with insulin while his hypertension was kept under control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. At three months follow-up  his limb pain resolved  and ulcers and gangrene did not progress any further.  Discussion: This case exemplifies how CLI often presents late in African Americans with T2DM and PAD. Smoking and uncontrolled T2DM were likely key factors that accelerated the progression of PAD to CLI. As CLI is associated with high rates of amputation and mortality  there needs to be an emphasis on early detection and management of risk factors  especially in high-risk racial/ethnic groups.   Conclusion: Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe and late-stage complication of Peripheral Arterial Disease that carries a significant risk for limb loss if not appropriately treated. Meticulous control of blood glucose levels  antiplatelet  and lipid-lowering therapy  along with regular surveillance  is vital in preventing progression of PAD to CLI in patients with T2DM. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,20,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 70-year-old Type 2 Diabetic Female Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral artery disease  is a burgeoning health issue with a high risk of limb amputation and mortality. Its major risk factors include diabetes  smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. We report a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with CLI.  Case Description: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the hospital with severe pain in her right lower leg. She had a history of type 2 diabetes for which she was on oral hypoglycemic agents. She never smoked and had no known history of hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Her body mass index was 28 kg/m^2  a value within the range of overweight.  Her pain began approximately six months prior to her hospital admission as a mild discomfort  but it had progressed  particularly during the last month when it began interfering with her sleep. She noticed that her right lower leg had started to change color  becoming noticeably paler than her left leg. She also noted that her pain would decrease when she would dangle her leg off of the edge of the bed.  Physical examination revealed a cold  pale  and pulseless right lower limb. The ankle-brachial index was 0.3 on the right and 1.1 on the left. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the absence of flow in her right lower limb arteries. A computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a long segment occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery with reconstitution of flow in the distal popliteal artery.  The patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. Endovascular therapy was performed with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the occluded superficial femoral artery segment. Her symptoms improved remarkably over the course of her hospital stay after revascularization treatment  and she was discharged with a follow-up plan for regular outpatient assessments.  Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia  particularly in high-risk groups like diabetics. Any symptoms of limb pain and changes in color and temperature should warrant thorough investigation for peripheral vascular disease and its severe complication  critical limb ischemia. Proper management can significantly improve the quality of life and decrease the risk of limb amputation and mortality. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,21,Title: Case Report on a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Description: A 68-year-old Caucasian male  a retired factory worker  with a previous history of diabetes mellitus (for 12 years) and peripheral arterial disease (diagnosed seven years ago)  presented with severe pain in his left lower extremity. He was a smoker for about 45 years and quit two years ago. Additionally  he had hypertension for the past 10 years and has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Presenting Concerns: The patient reported experiencing continuous rest pain in his left foot  particularly in the toes  for the last three months. The pain worsened considerably over the past two weeks  affecting his sleep and causing extreme discomfort. He had recently noticed the development of non-healing ulcers on his toes. The patient also reported a significant reduction in mobility due to pain severity.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed that the skin of the left lower extremity was notably cooler compared to the right. The color of the skin was pallor  and distal pulses in the left foot were absent. Non-healing ulcers approximately 2 cm in diameter were found on the tips of the great toe and third toe of the left foot. Pedal pulses were weak  and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements confirmed low blood flow in the left lower extremity.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Doppler ultrasound revealed significant stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery and absence of inversion flows in the left anterior tibial artery  posterior tibial artery and the peroneal artery  indicating severe ischaemic disease. These findings  in conjunction with the patient's symptoms and physical examination  pointed to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  Rutherford category 5.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy and pain management. This was followed by endovascular intervention  which included angioplasty and stent placement in the diseased segment to restore perfusion to the ischemic limb. After the procedures  his pain subsided significantly  and he reported improved quality of life. The patient’s foot ulcers showed gradual healing and antibiotic prophylaxis helped to prevent infection.  Follow-up and Outcome: On follow-up evaluation four weeks following intervention  the patient reported complete resolution of rest pain  and the ulcer showed signs of healing. ABI measurements indicated improved blood flow. The patient will continue to be monitored closely for signs of restenosis and ulcer recurrence.  Patient Perspective: The patient reported being satisfied with his treatment. His mobility improved significantly post-intervention  and he is currently engaged with a smoking cessation support group to manage his risk factors more effectively.   This case illustrates that early recognition of the symptoms of CLI and prompt interdisciplinary treatment are paramount in the successful management of this severe condition. It underscores the importance of smoking cessation  diabetes control  and the awareness of the severe consequences of arteriosclerosis to prevent the progression of this limb-threatening disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,22,Title: Surgical Management of a 65-Year-Old Female Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease  characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive vascular stenosis or occlusion. It results in ischemic rest pain  non-healing ulcers  or gangrene  leading to significantly increased risk of amputation if not managed promptly.   Patient Information: Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  with a 30-pack year history of smoking and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. She lives with her husband and is a retired schoolteacher.  Clinical Findings: She presented with a six-month history of progressive right lower extremity rest pain  combined with a two-week history of a non-healing ulcer on her right first toe. She reported pain when walking short distances  worsening in the last two weeks with a rating of 8 on the pain scale.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient’s Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was 0.40 on the right and 0.90 on the left. Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb revealed severe stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery  and occlusion of the popliteal artery and anterior tibial artery. Her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.6%.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially subjected to conservative management  including wound care and optimized medical therapy for diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. Further surgical intervention was commenced using a two-stage procedure. The first stage comprised bypass grafting of the right femoral-popliteal artery with an autologous vein. Revascularization was successful  and postoperative angiography demonstrated a patent bypass graft and re-established distal perfusion. The second-stage consisted of minor digital debridement.   Follow Up and Outcomes: The patient showed progressive improvement with the resolution of rest pain postoperatively. On her two-month follow up  her ulcer had completely healed. The ABI had improved to 0.98. She reported zero pain while walking and her HbA1c reduced to 7.1%.   Discussion: In certain instances of CLI  the intervention may not only save the limb but also improve the patient's quality of life as noted in this case. This case exemplifies the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving internists  endocrinologists  and vascular surgeons in the management of CLI in diabetics.  Conclusion: This case report underlines the crucial role of timely and appropriate intervention in managing CLI. The strategic management including surgical intervention and medical management of comorbidities can produce a significant relief of symptoms  got a proximate save of the limb  and improved the patient's quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,23,Title: Severe Peripheral Artery Disease Progressing to Critical Limb Ischemia in a Hispanic Male  Introduction:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the end-stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene. We present a case of a Hispanic male with CLI resulting from long-standing PAD.  Patient’s information:  Mr. Alvarez  a 66-year old Hispanic male patient  came to our clinic for a consult due to a worsening non-healing ulcer on the lateral aspect of his left lower extremity. The patient resides in an urban area  is married  and used to work as a construction laborer. He is currently retired and lives with his wife. His income is in the middle range  and he has health insurance.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a long-standing history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  which are managed with medications. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit 14 years ago. In addition  he has been diagnosed with PAD diagnosed approximately eight years ago.  Present Illness:  Mr. Alvarez noticed a small ulcer on his left leg approximately four months ago. The ulcer was initially not painful; however  over the last two months  it progressively increased in size and began to cause significant discomfort  especially at night. He has experienced loss of hair on his lower extremities  and he reports numbness and weakness in his legs  which have escalated recently. On physical examination  his left foot appeared cooler than the right one  and the ankle-brachial index was significantly reduced.   Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  there was a 3x3 cm ulcer with irregular margins located on the lateral lower leg  surrounded by hyperpigmented skin. Pulses were notably weak in both lower extremities  but particularly on the left - indicating poor circulation. Both feet were cool to the touch  and the left one showed signs of tissue necrosis. The patient was unable to feel any sensation in the left foot  suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.   Diagnostic Assessment:  The diagnosis of CLI was supported by clinical findings  ankle-brachial index  and peripheral arterial Doppler ultrasound showing severe multilevel peripheral arterial occlusive disease.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Revascularization was attempted  but the patient’s condition was too advanced for a bypass or angioplasty to be effective. Ultimately  given the unsuccessful revascularization attempts and rapidly advancing disease  the patient required amputation of his left lower limb.   Conclusion:  This case underlines the dire consequences of untreated PAD  particularly among Hispanic males  who have been found to bear a disproportionately higher prevalence of PAD and CLI. It highlights the need for early intervention aiming to control diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  and the importance of smoking cessation to prevent or slow the progression of PAD to CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,24,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-year-old Female Patient with History of Diabetes and Hypertension   Introduction:  The case focuses on a 72-year-old African-American female who presented with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities predominantly affecting older adults  especially those with a history of widespread atherosclerosis  diabetes  and hypertension.  Patient Information: The patient  Mrs A  is a retired school teacher living in Chicago  IL. She is a non-smoker  with a body mass index of 29  categorized as overweight. She has a 15-year history of type II diabetes managed with metformin and a 10-year history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril. She does not have any known allergies  and her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. Her father died at the age of 67 from a myocardial infarction  and her mother  aged 94  has a history of hypertension.   Clinic Presentation: Mrs. A reported experiencing rest pain for the past month  particularly in her left leg. The pain usually intensifies during the night and is temporarily relieved by hanging her leg over the edge of the bed. She also mentioned an ulcer on her left heel that started as a small wound approximately 2 months ago but has progressively worsened.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the left lower extremity was notably cooler than the right. Distal pulses were non-palpable in the left leg with decreased hair growth. The foot had a pallor appearance when elevated and became dependent rubor when placed in resting position. There was a 2.5cm ulcer on the left heel with a well-demarcated edge and a black necrotic eschar in the center  consistent with gangrene.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Diagnosis of CLI was primarily clinical  supported by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.32 on the left side. Ultrasound Doppler revealed multi-level occlusive disease in her left iliac  femoral  and infrapopliteal arteries. Duplex ultrasound and echocardiographic studies reported no proximal source of emboli. Consequently  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral arterial disease was made.  Treatment:  Endovascular revascularization was performed. She was initiated on dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin)  statins for cholesterol control  and pain management was achieved with opioids. Following the procedure  the patient was advised to attend a limb salvage program for wound care  diabetes control  and lifestyle modifications.  Conclusion:  CLI is a severe condition requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of regular screening for peripheral artery disease in high-risk individuals  particularly older adults  diabetics  and hypertensive patients  to mitigate the risk of amputation or severe disability. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,25,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Therapeutic Challenge   Introduction:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the most advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease  characterized by ischemic rest pain  nonhealing wounds  gangrene  and a considerable risk of limb loss. This case report describes a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a significant history of smoking and diabetes who presents with CLI.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian man with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-year history of smoking. He presented to the emergency department with a complaint of severe rest pain in his left lower limb. On examination  the limb was believed to have been affected by ischemia  which was pale  cold to the touch  with a nonhealing ulcer on the big toe  and absence of peripheral pulses.  Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history elucidated several underlying comorbidities. He had been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  which had been inconsistently controlled with metformin. The patient also had hypertension  treated with lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin. No history of previous cerebrovascular or cardiovascular incidents was reported.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented with a three-day history of severe unremitting rest pain in the left lower limb  particularly in the foot region  which got worse at night. The pain was severe enough to disturb his sleep and OTC pain relievers had not provided any relief. In addition to pain  discoloration  numbness  an ulcer on the big toe  and decreased mobility were also observed.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination findings included critical limb ischemic signs such as pallor  poikilothermia (cold to touch)  pulselessness  and paraesthesia. A nonhealing ulcer was observed on his big toe. Peripheral pulses including the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were absent.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the patient's symptoms and history  a diagnostic workup was completed with an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Duplex ultrasound  and CT angiography. ABI was significantly decreased to 0.4. The Duplex ultrasound and CT angiography confirmed the clinical suspicion of peripheral artery disease with severe stenosis of left the posterior tibial artery and anterior tibial artery.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on pain control with opioids and high-intensity statin therapy. Subsequently  he underwent successful angioplasty with stenting of the left posterior tibial artery and anterior tibial artery. Simultaneously  the wound was treated with debridement and application of specialized wound dressings.     Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of early recognition  prompt diagnostic assessment  and effective management of CLI among high-risk populations  particularly those with diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a significant smoking history. The multi-faceted approach combining both medical and endovascular therapies proved effective in this case.    Key Words: Critical Limb Ischemia  Peripheral Arterial Disease  Diabetes  Smoking  Angioplasty.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,26,Title: Progression and Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 70-year-old Diabetic Female  Patient Information: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian woman based in Syracuse  New York with a past medical history significant for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She has had diabetes for the past 20 years and hypertension for 10 years. She has a history of smoking (up to 1 pack per day for the past 45 years) but quit 5 years ago. She does not consume alcohol or recreational drugs. Her medications include Metformin  an ACE inhibitor  and low-dose aspirin.   History of Present Illness: The patient was referred to the vascular clinic by her primary care physician due to increasing pain in her left leg  which she rated 7/10 on the pain scale. The patient noted the pain was intermittent and exacerbated when walking (claudication)  often subsiding with rest. She also reported a recent foot wound that was healing poorly.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  she was noted to have dry  cold skin on the left foot  characterized by noticeable hair loss. Her pedal pulses were diminished in the left foot compared to the right. She had a non-healing ulcer on her left big toe. There was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis  and neurologic abnormalities were not detected.  Investigations: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) assessment indicated significant reductions  particularly in the left foot. The patient also underwent a Doppler ultrasound  which revealed significant stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery  affirming the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and investigations  this patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe manifestation of PAD. Her long-standing diabetes coupled with a smoking history had likely contributed to the development of CLI.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient’s case was discussed in multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings comprising vascular surgeons  interventional radiologists  and nursing staff. The consensus was to perform an Endovascular Lower Limb Angioplasty procedure given the severity of her condition. She was also commenced on a higher dose of aspirin and a statin to manage her atherosclerotic risk factors  additionally  her diabetes was aggressively managed. Wound care was provided for her toe ulcer.   Post-procedure  she reported a significant reduction in her pain levels  and improved pedal pulse was noted. She was advised to continue her medications and engage with rehab services. Also she was referred to a smoking cessation program  and a dietary plan was formulated for managing her diabetes.   Conclusion: CLI is a common complication of longstanding diabetes and high-risk behaviors such as smoking. This case highlights the importance of aggressive risk factor management  timely intervention  and multidisciplinary care in the progress of patients with CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,27,Patient Background:  This case report revolves around a 69-year-old  African-American male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  hailing from a rural city in the mid-western United States where he is engaged in farming. He has been a smoker for approximately 45 years  averaging 20 cigarettes per day. He is married and lives with his wife  who shares the responsibility of managing their farm.   Past Medical History:  The patient has been suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years and hypertension for the past 10 years. Both conditions have been managed and controlled to some extent with medications including Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. The patient also has a habit of not taking his medicines regularly despite repeated warnings from his primary care physician regarding the potential adverse health outcomes. He has no allergies and no history of surgeries or hospitalizations. He has occasional alcohol consumption but denies illicit drug use.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with severe  rest pain in both legs  particularly his right foot  which is preventing him from sleeping and initiating movement. The pain worsens on physical exertion and relieved partially on taking rest. The patient reports a significant decrease in mobility  causing him difficulty in his day-to-day farming activities. His wife noticed non-healing sores on the foot that the patient attributed to minor farm injuries. There was associated weight loss and decreased appetite. There was no history of trauma  fever  chest pain nor shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination showed weak pedal pulses bilaterally. His right foot had superficial ulcers on the dorsum and heel  with signs of critical limb ischemia like pallor  cyanosis  and coldness distal to the ankle. His BMI was calculated at 26  indicating overweight. Other systems examination including cardiovascular and respiratory revealed no significant findings.  Investigations:  Diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was confirmed through an ankle-brachial index (ABI)  which was very low. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed significant stenosis in distal portions of both the popliteal arteries  more in the right than the left one. Blood tests revealed poor glycemic control with HbA1c of 9.6%.  Diagnosis:  The clinical presentation and findings together confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  with an underlying etiology of peripheral artery disease likely secondary to long-standing diabetes  hypertension  and tobacco use.  Management:  The patient was referred to the vascular surgery department for angioplasty and stenting. His primary care physician reinforced the importance of strict adherence to oral hypoglycemics and antihypertensives. Nicotine replacement therapy was started to assist in smoking cessation. A dietitian and physical therapist were included in the team for expert dietary advice and personalized exercise plans. He was treated conservatively with analgesics  antiplatelets (aspirin)  and statins (atorvastatin).  Future Monitoring:  The patient is planned for regular follow-ups with endocrinology  vascular surgery  and primary care to monitor his vascular status  pain management  and glycemic and hypertension control. The necessity for cessation of smoking  adherence to medication  and regular exercise were discussed with the patient. The importance of wound hygiene and care was also emphasized to avoid future complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,28,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-year-old African-American male with Cardiovascular Comorbidities  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male  retired  living in an urban area with his wife. As per CDC statistics  the African-American community has a relatively higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) such as Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  cardiovascular comorbidities reflected in this case.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with non-healing sores and increasingly frequent episodes of rest pain in his right lower limb for the past 6 months. His symptoms remained unresolving with increasing right lower limb pain severity  precipitating a clinic visit.  Background: The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension  controlled by Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. He has a 7-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with Metformin. He has also been managing hyperlipidemia for eight years with Atorvastatin. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his late father facing a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 68  and his older brother undergoing an angioplasty at the age of 73. The patient has a 15-year pack history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol and denies any illegal recreational drug use.   Medical Examination: Clinically  his lower extremity pulses were diminished in his right lower limb with pallor upon elevation and dependent rubor. The ischemic rest pain was predominantly localized in his right foot. On examination  the right foot showed dystrophic nail changes  hair loss  and a non-healing ulcer on the plantar aspect of the right big toe. Observations were consistent with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford grade IV).  Diagnostic Assessment: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  which resulted in a reading of less than 0.4 in the right lower limb  strengthening the suspicion of severe PAD  a precursor to Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI). A subsequent CT Angiography revealed extensive femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal atherosclerotic disease in the right lower limb. Laboratory investigations did not reveal any significant abnormality  and the patient was deemed fit for intervention.  Treatment: The patient was started on a regimen of clopidogrel and high-dose statins and was referred for revascularization. Endovascular therapy involving balloon angioplasty was planned due to extensive infrapopliteal disease.  Follow-Up: Integrating medical management  angioplasty  and diabetes control  the patient demonstrated progress with reduced pain severity and improvement in the non-healing ulcer. The patient was educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications  wound care  and glycemic control. The patient will receive consistent follow-ups to manage the condition.  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and prompt management of critical limb ischemia  especially in patients with well-known risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia — all of which are common in the African-American population.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,29,Title: Acute Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 70-Year-Old Male with History of Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease (PAD) often seen among elderly patients with a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia.  Patient Information: We report the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male patient  living in a suburban region of the United States  who presented with signs and symptoms indicative of CLI. He is a retired corporal and had a 30-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He has a documented history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia.  Clinical Findings: The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of rest pain in his right lower extremity  specifically in the calf  that markedly increased over the past week. The pain persisted even at rest and was reported to be more severe at night. He noted a progressive worsening color change of his right foot to pale and cold to touch. Additionally  he reported no sensation in his right foot but had a constant burning sensation.  Timeline:  1) Patient with chronic uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension for ten years. 2) Five years ago  he started to experience intermittent claudication. 3) Six months ago  he noticed skin color changes on foot. 4) One week ago  severe rest pain and cold foot noticed.  Diagnostic Assessment: Physical examination revealed a weak pulse in the right femoral and popliteal regions  and absent in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery. Skin on right extremities showed changes  such as dryness and thinning  with apparent atrophy. An angiogram  Doppler ultrasound and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) tests were done which confirmed the diagnosis of CLI.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of the right superficial femoral artery to restore blood flow. He was also started on antiplatelets  statins  and metabolic therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Complete wound healing occurred four weeks after the intervention; follow-up duplex ultrasound scans demonstrated good flow through the treated artery. Rest pain and claudication resolved.  Patient Perspective: The patient mentioned that he never associated his smoking history and uncontrolled diabetes with his symptoms. Since he lives alone  it was challenging to manage and monitor his condition adequately.   Discussion: This case illustrates the acceleration of PAD to CLI where high-risk factors  such as diabetes and smoking  existed. It reinforces the importance of early recognition  management of afflictive conditions and patient education  with a focus on those living alone.   Conclusions: Efficient management of CLI includes aggressive control of modifiable risk factors  timely revascularization  and early detection to prevent progression to major amputations and life-threatening complications. Public health strategies focusing on effective patient education may potentially improve outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,30,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic Patient with Chronic Renal Failure  Introduction: This case report tracks the clinical progress of a 62-year-old African-American male patient diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  diabetes mellitus type II  and chronic renal failure.  Patient information: The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male  retired  a non-smoker and resident of a suburban community.  Presenting complaints: Patient presented to the outpatient care unit complaining of progressive bilateral lower limb pain lasting for several months  worsening over the last week. Pain was prominent at rest and disturbing his sleep. He also reported coldness of the feet and loss of hair on the lower parts of the legs.  Past medical history: The patient has a documented 15-year history of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure stage IV. He also has a 6-year history of peripheral artery disease and was medically managed. The patient had an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor allergy but no reported history of coronary artery disease or stroke.  Clinical findings: On examination  both feet were cool to touch  peripheral pulses were absent  and capillary refill time was delayed. Findings were consistent with Rutherford Stage IV CLI. The ankle-brachial index was 0.28 bilaterally. Ulceration or gangrene was not present  but significant atrophy of the skin and underlying muscles were observed.   Diagnostic assessment: Duplex ultrasound showed extensive atherosclerotic lesions in both the superficial femoral arteries and popliteal arteries. Further diagnostic angiography confirmed multi-segment disease with infrapopliteal occlusions and severely compromised distal run-off. Blood tests revealed HbA1c at 9.6%  suggesting suboptimal glycemic control. Renal parameters were consistent with his known stage IV chronic renal disease.   Therapeutic interventions and follow-up: Given the patient's comorbid conditions and the extent of the vascular disease  revascularization options were limited. After a discussion with an interdisciplinary team consisting of a diabetologist  vascular surgeon  and nephrologist  it was decided to initially manage the patient conservatively. Aggressive glycemic  blood pressure  and statin therapy were initiated. Prostaglandin analogs were used for symptomatic relief.   Conclusion: This case exemplifies the complexities and challenges managing patients with CLI  especially in the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Such patients require careful evaluation  aggressive risk factor management  and a collaborative approach to decision making.  This case report serves as an empirical evidence of the need for early and aggressive management of diabetes  kidney disease  and peripheral artery disease to prevent severe disability-like CLI. It further necessitates the need for stringent follow-up protocols  early referral for specialist opinion  and timely therapeutic interventions. Further large-scale studies are required to strategize better therapeutic options for similar cases.

He also mentioned intermittent claudication worsening over the last six months with a decreased ability to walk more than 100 feet before needing rest due to pain.  Medical History: The patient has a 15-year history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HbA1c: 9.0%) and Hypertension. He has also been diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3) and has a history of smoking (30 pack-years). His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  Atorvastatin  and Aspirin.  Examination: On physical examination  the patient had a gangrenous wound on his right distal calf with areas of dry necrosis. Lower extremity examination revealed decreased sensations  diminished distal pulses in both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries  and pallor on elevation of the right foot.  Investigations: Duplex ultrasonography of the lower limbs confirmed moderate to severe peripheral artery disease with notable stenoses in his right superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was recorded to be 0.3 in the right lower limb  indicating critical limb ischemia.   Treatment: Due to the presence of critical limb ischemia and a non-healing wound  the patient was admitted to the vascular surgery department for a below-knee amputation. The operation was successfully performed without any immediate complications. Post-operation  the patient was started on a comprehensive rehabilitative program and was educated on lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation  stringent glucose control  and a balanced diet.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of aggressive management and early recognition of peripheral artery disease in a high-risk population  such as African American patients with poorly controlled diabetes. These patients require prompt aggressive medical therapy and occasionally surgical intervention to prevent limb loss.   Follow-up: The patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day and was scheduled for a follow-up after two weeks. At the two-week follow-up  the patient was noted to be healing well and adapting to his prosthetic limb.  Learning points: Critical limb ischemia is a severe condition with high morbidity and mortality rates  especially in patients with diabetes. Early recognition  aggressive medical therapy  and in severe cases  surgical intervention  offer the best possibilities for limb salvage and improved survival rates. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,32,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old Diabetic Male: A Case Report  Patient Information: A 68-year-old African American male patient from an urban community presented at the hospital complaining of severe and continuous pain in his left lower limb  especially his foot. The patient is retired and a widower  who currently lives alone.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of poorly controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus over the last 13 years  with an unattended HbA1c level consistently over 8.0% for the past year. He is also known to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with a 25-year history of smoking two packs per day  though he quit five years ago. There is no known history of any allergies.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed coolness  pallor  and weakening of the dorsalis pedis pulse in the left foot  with the presence of intermittent claudication and non-healing ulcers. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was found to be 0.45 on the left side. The patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 29. Comprehensive systemic examination was unremarkable  with no evidence of reduced perfusion in the cerebral or coronary arteries.  Diagnostic assessment: High-resolution color Doppler and CT angiography of the lower extremities revealed significant atherosclerotic blockages in the left lower limb  particularly in the femoral and tibial arteries consistent with critical limb ischemia. Laboratory investigations showed poorly controlled diabetes and dyslipidemia.  Therapeutic intervention: Immediate surgical intervention was planned in the form of a lower limb angioplasty and possible placement of a stent. Glycemic control was aggressively pursued with the re-evaluation of his antidiabetic medications. His antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications were also reviewed and adjusted as needed.  Follow-up and outcomes: Post-operatively  the patient reported decreased pain and an improved pulse in the distal portion of the limb. Effective diabetic control  lipid-lowering therapy  and cessation of smoking was emphasized. Regular follow-up over six months showed improved wound healing and no recurrence of symptoms.  Patient Perspective: The patient was initially apprehensive about the amputation but was pleased with the outcome and improved quality of life post-intervention. He expressed willingness to comply with the recommended lifestyle changes to prevent future recurrence of the condition.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of critical limb ischemia  especially in high-risk patients with comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and a history of smoking  to prevent limb loss and improve patient outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,33,Patient Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information  Name: [Anonymous for confidentiality] Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Past Medical History:  The patient has a complex medical history with several contributing risk factors such as hypertension  controlled diabetes mellitus type II  wide-spread atherosclerosis  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack year history. In the past  he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) approximately 10 years ago  following a diagnosis of coronary heart disease. There is also a history of intermittent claudication  which started several years back.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient was first presented to the clinic with a non-healing wound on his right lower limb for 2 months. It was associated with intermittent rest pain which had worsened in the preceding two weeks. He reported an inability to walk more than half a block without experiencing significant calf pain. He expressed concerns about his overall quality of life being affected due to his inability to perform regular activities.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the right limb visibly displayed pallor and atrophy with an absent pulse. An ulcer measuring around 3cm in diameter was noted on the dorsum of the right foot. Both lower extremities were cool to touch  further suggesting impaired blood circulation.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was conducted that came back as 0.5 on the right leg  suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The Duplex ultrasound displayed severe obstruction in the right limb's superficial femoral artery. Imaging reports showed severe arterial occlusions in the limb. A computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) of the lower extremities further confirmed significant atherosclerotic disease throughout the infra-popliteal arteries. Complete blood count  lipid profile  and random blood sugar were within normal limits.  Considering the clinical findings and investigations  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made due to chronic total occlusions in the right lower extremity.  Treatment and Follow-up:  Initially  the patient was started on conservative management with optimal medical therapy including antiplatelet  statin  and optimal diabetes control. Given his symptoms and the degree of occlusion  peripheral angioplasty was performed. The intervention was successful and post-procedure  there was a notable increase in the ABI with adequate perfusion to the lower extremities.  Following the procedure  the patient was enrolled in a supervised exercise program to improve mobility  and routine follow-ups were planned to monitor wound healing and progress. On recent follow-up  the patient reported a significant reduction in rest pain and improved ability to walk without discomfort.  This case underlines the importance of early detection and intervention in patients presenting with CLI to prevent severe complications such as limb loss and to significantly improve patient’s quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,35,Title: A Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 62-year-old Vietnamese Female Patient  Introduction:  This case study explores the presentation  diagnosis  and management of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in a 62-year-old Vietnamese woman  Mrs. T. Nguyen  with a past medical history of heavy smoking  diabetes mellitus  and hypertension.  Case Presentation: Mrs. Nguyen presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  recurring pain in her left foot. The pain had been progressively worsening over the past four months  affecting her sleep and daily activities. Examination revealed a cold  pulseless left lower limb with notable color changes. Additionally  Mrs. Nguyen reported foot ulcers that have not healed for more than three weeks. She has a 30-year smoking history  poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus for fifteen years  and hypertension for the last ten years.  Clinical Findings:  Upon her first evaluation  Mrs. Nguyen's blood pressure was 145/92mmHg  blood glucose was 250 mg/dl  and BMI was 24.7. A bedside Doppler ultrasound confirmed absent pulses in the left foot and decreased flow in the left popliteal artery. An angiogram demonstrated occlusions in the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery along with significant stenosis in infrapopliteal vessels modeling a multi-level peripheral artery disease.  Diagnosis:  Given her clinical presentation  previous medical history  and the results of our investigations  Mrs. Nguyen was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Firstly  Mrs. Nguyen’s blood glucose and blood pressure were aggressively managed. After stabilization  she underwent successful angioplasty to address occlusions and restore the blood flow to her lower limb. An endovascular approach was chosen due to her comorbidities. A stent was placed in the left superficial femoral artery. Furthermore  she was advised to quit smoking and prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Mrs. Nguyen showed considerable clinical improvement at her one-week post-op check. Her foot pain had significantly reduced  and her foot ulcers showed signs of healing. She enrolled in a smoking cessation program and diabetes self-management education sessions. In later follow-ups  she demonstrated improved control over her diabetes and hypertension. At her six-month follow-up  her foot ulcers had completely healed  and she reported no claudication or rest pain.  Conclusion: Critical limb ischemia is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease. CLI has a higher prevalence in patients with comorbidities such as smoking history  diabetes  and hypertension  as with Mrs. Nguyen. Early recognition  aggressive management of risk factors  and a proper vascular intervention can mitigate limb loss and improve patients' quality of life.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,36,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 73-Year-Old Male   Demographics  The patient  Mr. X  is a 73-year-old male of Asian descent who is a resident of an urban community in San Francisco  California. He is a retired engineer  a widower with three adult children  and has a support network in place. He has Medicare insurance and adequate financial resources to support both his living and medical expenses.  Past Medical History  Mr. X has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled by oral medications for the past decade. He also has a 40-pack-year smoking history but has been abstinent from tobacco for five years. He does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs. His past surgical history is notable for an appendectomy in his 30s.   Presenting Problem  Mr. X presented with escalating symptoms of rest pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the foot. His pain  characterized as sharp and intense  intensifies at night and is relieved slightly by dangling the limb. Over the period of last two weeks  he also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left great toe. He denies any trauma  fever  or discharge from the wound.  Physical Examination   The patient appeared to be in moderate distress due to pain. His blood pressure on presentation was 160/90 mm Hg  pulse rate was regular at 72 beats/minute  respiratory rate was 18 breaths/minute  and body temperature was 98.6°F. Local examination of his left foot revealed a trophic ulcer on the dorsal aspect of the great toe  surrounded by calloused skin. Palpation revealed diminished pulses in left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed approximately 70% stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery and complete occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery.  Diagnosis  Based on the clinical presentation and the results of objective tests  Mr. X was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) of his left limb.  Clinical Course and Treatment  Mr. X was admitted to the vascular surgery unit and started on conservative management initially with adequate pain control  emollient applications for foot care  and strict glycemic control for diabetes. Considering the extent of arterial blockage and the risk of limb loss  he underwent a successful left lower limb revascularization procedure. This significantly improved his symptoms  and he was eventually discharged home with a multi-disciplinary follow-up plan for wound management  diabetes control  and lifestyle modification counseling.   This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and multi-disciplinary management of CLI  particularly among elderly patients with a long-term history of risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,37,Title: Successful Revascularization in a Male Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia and Multiple Comorbidities  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 73-year-old African American male  presenting with a two-week history of excruciating pain in his right foot. He is a retired manual laborer  living in a semi-rural area with his wife of 50 years. He is an ex-smoker with a 45-pack-year history but has abstained for the last 15 years. His BMI is 30  indicating obesity.  Past medical history reveals an intricate medical condition with significant comorbidities. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin for about 20 years  hypertension for 15 years  chronic kidney disease stage III for ten years  and peripheral artery disease for five years. He has a history of non-compliance to medication due to his limited understanding of the diseases.  Upon physical examination  the skin of the patient’s right foot was notably pale with areas of non-healing wounds on the dorsum. An absent dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior pulse was noted. There was reduced tactile and pain sensation  indicative of peripheral neuropathy. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  resulting in a value of 0.5  confirming the presence of severe peripheral artery disease.   The patient underwent angiography  which showed severe multi-level stenosis  occlusion in the right lower limb arteries  the right popliteal artery  and its distal branches. The clinical picture raised suspicion for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Treatment:  After obtaining informed consent  we proceeded to an endovascular revascularization procedure. Balloon angioplasty was performed. Post-procedure  the patient had immediate restoration of blood flow to the affected region with the recovery of pulses. He was discharged home on antiplatelet drugs and statins with modifications to his existing hypertensive and diabetes treatment.  Follow-up:  The patient was reviewed in the vascular clinic at one month  three months  and six months post-procedure. He experienced a significant reduction in pain and ulcer healing. No further sequelae of CLI were noted. His ulcers had healed noticeably by the six-month follow-up  and pain was significantly reduced.  Conclusion:  Successful management of CLI in a high-risk patient requires effective collaboration and communication among multidisciplinary teams. Early recognition  risk factor modification  and appropriate revascularization are key to preventing limb loss in CLI. Despite the challenges posed by multiple comorbidities  our patient achieved a favorable outcome  illustrating the importance of individualized therapy. This case underscores the importance of regular follow-up care in ensuring medication adherence and health education  particularly in patients with low health literacy.  Notes:  The patient represents the general demographics of CLI patients – older  male  African American with multiple comorbidities.

It is common for these patients to reside in semi-rural or rural areas  facing geographical challenges to healthcare access. The case underscores the importance of recognizing CLI as a severe form of PAD and understanding its associations with overall cardiovascular risk. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,38,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 63-Year-Old African American Female with a Previous Medical History of Diabetes Mellitus & Hypertension  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe peripheral artery disease manifestation indicative of significant systemic arterial atherosclerosis. The prevalence is relatively high amongst elderly persons  particularly those with cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and a history of smoking.  Case Presentation: A 63-year-old African American female was admitted to the hospital presenting with severe rest pain in her left lower extremity  ulceration on her left foot  and coldness in the limb  lasting for the past three weeks. She has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years and hypertension. The patient was a former smoker with a 40 pack-years’ history but quit five years ago. The patient also reported a significant inability to walk short distances without experiencing intense pain  significantly impairing her physical and emotional quality of life.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient's left foot was pale with poor capillary refill and had a pulseless dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery. Vibration perception and monofilament sensation were decreased on the left foot. A non-healing ulcer measuring 2 cm in diameter was seen on her left metatarsal. The right lower extremity was normal. Her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate 85 beats per minute  body mass index (BMI) 28.5  and random blood glucose level 200 mg/dL with HBA1c at 9%.   Investigations:  The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was recorded at 0.50 in the left limb  suggestive of moderate to severe arterial disease. Her serum cholesterol levels were slightly elevated. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated significantly decreased blood flow in the left lower extremity. CT angiography showed multiple focal severe stenoses in the left infra-popliteal arteries.  Management: Following multidisciplinary team discussions  the patient was considered for endovascular revascularization. She received medical management for her diabetes and hypertension  aiming for tighter glucose and blood pressure control. Comprehensive wound care  including debridement and the use of appropriate dressings  commenced. She was started on statins  antiplatelet therapy  and low molecular weight heparin. The patient's pain reduced significantly while the ulcer showed signs of healing post-revascularization.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of continuous management and strict control of risk factors among patients with CLI  especially in individuals with a high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. Prompt recognition  multidisciplinary team involvement  and aggressive treatment significantly improved the patient’s quality of life and limb prognosis. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,39,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Asian Female with Type 2 Diabetes and Coexisting Peripheral Artery Disease: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  often resulting from profound atherosclerotic vessel obstruction. It is commonly observed in individuals with a history of smoking  obesity  diabetes  and hypertension. CLI presents with rest pain  non-healing ulcers  or gangrene in the extremities  particularly the lower limbs.  Case Presentation: The subject of this case report is a 78-year-old Asian female  residing in a suburban community. She is a nonsmoker and denies alcohol consumption. The patient has a documented medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus under management for the past 20 years  hypertension managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and a recently diagnosed PAD.   She visited her primary physician with chief complaints of progressive pain on her lower left limb at rest  which intensifies at night. On physical examination  the patient's left foot was noticeably cooler than the right  pallor was observed on elevation  and the foot showed delayed capillary fill time. A non-healing ulcer was found on the left heel. The dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable bilaterally. Peripheral neuropathy was evident  as she reported decreased sensation in her lower extremities.  Management: On the basis of the patient's symptoms  clinical history  and physical examination  a presumptive diagnosis of CLI was made. The patient was referred for an ankle-brachial index (ABI) which yielded a measurement of 0.4 (Normal > 1.0) in her left leg. Doppler ultrasound showed significantly reduced blood flow in the left lower limb. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of CLI  and the patient was promptly referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation and recommendations on potential intervention.  Conclusion: This case highlights the intricacies of managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and the interrelation among such conditions  PAD  and ensuing CLI. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are often at a higher risk of atherosclerotic changes  and more so when co-existing with hypertension. As this case exemplifies  routine examination and prompt attention to symptoms related to peripheral circulation in high-risk individuals could aid early diagnosis and potential prevention of severe complications such as CLI. Treatment goals should be aimed at addressing the underlying risk factors  facilitating wound healing  relieving ischemic pain  and preserving limb functionality.  Ethical Approval: All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,40,Title: A Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Post-menopausal African American Female with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Renal Failure  Abstract: Presented is a case of a 68-year-old African American female with a history of poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure who was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The complexity of the case was compounded by the patient's previous diagnoses and her limited access to healthcare services due to socioeconomic constraints.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient  Mrs. L  is a 68-year-old African American female who presented with severe pain in her right lower leg that started six months ago. Mrs. L has been suffering from diabetes for almost 20 years and chronic renal failure for approximately five years. Both conditions are managed with medication; however  her adherence has been sporadic due to financial constraints and lack of access to regular healthcare services. Mrs. L is a retired blue-collar worker and lives alone. She is a widow with five adult children with only occasional family support.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  her right leg appeared ischemic with a cold  dusky appearance along with some necrotic tissue in the toenail beds. Mrs. L had diminished pulses in her right lower extremity and absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. She presented with a resting pain score of 8 on a 10-point scale  and her ankle brachial index was at 0.50 for her right leg.  Diagnostic Assessment: Duplex ultrasound confirmed the presence of multi-level obstructive lesions  consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia. Lab test results showed elevated blood glucose levels and serum creatinine  indicating uncontrolled diabetes and chronic kidney disease progression. Given her clinical presentation and subsequent results from her diagnostic tests  she was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Therapeutic Intervention & Follow-up: Due to the grave nature of Mrs. L's CLI  revascularization was deemed necessary. Given her history of diabetes and renal failure  meticulous pre and post-surgical care was required. Unfortunately  she underwent an above-the-knee amputation due to the severity of the ischemia. After surgery  Mrs. L was monitored closely in the hospital for a fortnight  and there were no immediate post-operative complications. She was discharged and was slated for ongoing follow-up appointments  and would be introduced to rehabilitation services for her new prosthesis.  Conclusion: This case highlights the challenges in managing CLI in a patient with co-morbid conditions of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. It emphasizes the need for early detection and diligent management of systemic conditions that can accelerate the progression of peripheral arterial disease  ultimately leading to CLI. Furthermore  it reinforces the socioeconomic barriers that many patients face in managing their health effectively. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,41,"Title: """"Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Patient with Multiple Co-Morbidities: A Case Report""""  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) demands urgent action due to its connection with high morbidity  mortality  and amputation risk  especially in patients with multiple health concerns that complicate treatment. CLI is a prevalent condition in elderly patients  often associated with peripheral arterial disease  diabetes mellitus  and a history of smoking.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 78-year-old African American male  weighing approximately 70 kg  was presented to the emergency department with severe rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his right lower leg. Symptoms had been escalating over the past three weeks. It was noted on examination that there were signs of tissue loss and gangrene present distally  confirming a Rutherford stage 5 of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient was a former smoker with a 40-pack year history but had quit smoking approximately ten years ago.  Medical History: The patient's medical history involved multiple co-morbidities  including type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago  hypertension  stage III chronic kidney disease  and a previous heart attack around five years ago. He was on insulin  metformin  carvedilol  and amlodipine  for his respective conditions.  Investigations: After his initial consultation  the patient underwent an ankle-brachial Index (ABI) which measured less than 0.4. A subsequent duplex ultrasound confirmed significant blockages in his right superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. These findings  combined with his severe symptoms and signs of tissue loss  led to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Management and Outcome: Given the patient's multiple co-morbidity and CLI stage  the risk of invasive surgery deemed too great. Thus  the patient was managed with medications  including dual antiplatelet therapy and statins  and with the assistance of adequate pain control. Supervised exercise therapy and wound care were initiated. His condition was closely monitored  but unfortunately  despite best efforts  the patient eventually required a trans-tibial (below the knee) amputation due to a lack of sufficient improvement and the progress of gangrene.  Discussion: This case highlights the complexities in managing CLI in elderly patients with co-morbidities and emphasizes the importance of taking prompt actions to slow disease advancement and improve the patient's quality of life. However  substantial challenges remain  as shown in this case  as vascular surgery options might not always be applicable. This case indeed reiterates the need for the development of more comprehensive and innovative strategies to manage such clinical scenarios.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,42,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65 Year-Old Male with Previous Vascular Pathology and Diabetes  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  typically affects older adults and is frequently associated with systemic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. This report describes a case of a 65-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes and vascular diseases  who presented with CLI.  Case Presentation: Mr. A. S.  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the outpatient vascular clinic with a two-week history of increasing pain in his right lower extremity  primarily at rest. He reported an associated coldness of the right foot with noticeable color changes  and intermittent claudication.  Past Medical History: A.S. has managed type-2 diabetes for 20 years and was diagnosed with PAD five years ago. He also has a 10-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication. Due to the PAD  he had undergone a right femoral-popliteal bypass procedure three years ago. He has a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years  but quit smoking two years ago.  Clinical Findings: On physical exam  his right foot was pale and cool to touch  with diminished pulses in the right popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries. There was no noticeable edema but his right foot showed areas of dry gangrene on the toes. Neurologic examination demonstrated decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally  with the right side showing a more marked reduction.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory results  including complete blood count  liver and renal function tests  were within normal limits except for fasting blood glucose (180 mg/dl) and HbA1C (8.5%). An ultrasound Doppler study revealed severe stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and occlusion in the popliteal artery. A diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was confirmed.  Therapeutic Intervention: Despite the patient's high surgical risk  due to his diabetes and a previous bypass  a decision on revascularization strategy to salvage the limb was made. The patient underwent successful angioplasty and stenting. His diabetes and hypertension management were optimized  and he was referred for specialized wound care.  Follow-Up and Outcome: At subsequent visits  A.S. reported an improvement in rest pain  with gradual healing of ischemic ulcers. Further vascular follow-ups were organized  along with aggressive monitoring of his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The patient was also enrolled for smoking cessation support and patient education on foot care.  Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay of diabetes  vascular pathology  and CLI. Timely revascularization along with optimizing management of systemic conditions can lead to improved outcomes in this high-risk population.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.

His pain was exacerbated by motion and relieved with rest. He claimed that he had difficulty walking due to non-healing sores and wounds on his right leg  causing him to limp. He reported no history of trauma or injury. Additionally  he mentioned experiencing coldness in the affected limb along with discomfort at night. He was a retired laborer living with his wife  one of the 58.6 million Hispanic people in the United States  representative of the U.S. demographic population.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years  managed with metformin and insulin injections. He was also a chronic smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. Additionally  he had hypertension treated with lisinopril and atherosclerotic heart disease without any history of percutaneous coronary interventions. His family history revealed that his father suffered a myocardial infarction at age 57 and his older brother had underwent a lower limb amputation due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). He admitted to occasional alcohol consumption and denied use of any illicit drugs.  Examination and Investigations: On physical examination  his right lower extremity was cool to touch compared to the contralateral limb  and foot pulses were absent upon palpation. His leg demonstrated pallor on elevation and dependent rubor. Doppler ultrasound showed notably decreased blood flow in the arteries of the right leg.  An angiogram confirmed chronic total occlusion of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery  suggesting the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the severe stage of PAD. Blood tests including complete blood count  coagulation profile  kidney function tests  and lipid profile were all found to be within normal limits. HbA1c was elevated (9.0%)  indicating poorly controlled diabetes.  Treatment and Follow-Up: The patient was initially stabilized with pain management and was promptly referred to the vascular surgery department for further intervention. An aorto-bi-femoral bypass surgery was reasonably successful  followed by an intensive rehabilitation program. Postoperatively  the patient was advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption. An endocrinologist was also consulted for better diabetes control.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the risks associated with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and smoking in patients with CLI. Early identification  aggressive management of these risk factors  and the interprofessional approach in the care of such patients are imperative to improve clinical outcomes and curtail the progression of the disease.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,48,Title: A Case Report on the Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 63-year-old Female  Introduction:  We present a case of a 63-year-old female displaying clinical symptoms suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The patient was in relatively good health until the ascertainment of the disease. This case provides an insight into the diagnostic pathway and treatment strategies of CLI in aged female patients.  Case Presentation:  The patient was a 63-year-old Caucasian female who presented with a complaint of severe pain  claudication and ulceration on her left foot which worsened over several months. The patient's pain was noted to be consistent and increased significantly with activity affecting her mobility and quality of life. She reported no tobacco or illicit drug use but did consume alcohol modestly and responsibly. She had a body mass index (BMI) of 26.5kg/m2 denoting overweight.  Medical History:  The patient's medical history included well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes which were being managed effectively with antihypertensive medication and metformin respectively for about five years. She had a history of intermittent claudication for a year. No family history of peripheral arterial disease or ischemic heart disease was reported.   Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  the patient’s left foot appeared pale with diminished pulses in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. An ulceration measuring approximately 1.5 cm was noted on the left foot's dorsal surface  surrounded by erythema and induration. A Doppler ultrasound performed indicated severely compromised arterial flow in the lower extremity.  Due to the severity of symptoms and her history of diabetes and hypertension  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was considered. Angiography was performed which confirmed obstruction in distal left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery with no flow in the pedal arteries  supporting the diagnosis of CLI.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Conservative management with anti-platelet therapy  statins and foot care education was initiated. However  considering the complete obstruction  the multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with revascularization. The patient underwent successful endovascular surgery — angioplasty and stenting of the femoral artery. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated post-procedure.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient followed up at 1  3  and 6 months post-procedure. She reported significant relief from rest pain and showed signs of wound healing at each follow-up. The patient was able to resume most of her regular activities by the third follow-up. Further  she was instructed to continue her medication regimen and undergo regular follow-up to monitor the condition  given the risk for recurrent ischemia.  Conclusion:  This case enriches the existing literature on the effective management of CLI in aged diabetic females with hypertension and highlights the need for timely diagnosis and intervention in these patients. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,49,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old African American Male: A Case Report   Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  most often a consequence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  is a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which markedly reduces blood-flow. This report highlights a case of a 68-year-old African American male with CLI and the subsequent clinical management.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male who resides in New York City. He is a retired civil servant with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for 12 years  hypertension for 10 years  and a 20 pack-year history of smoking. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril and low-dose Aspirin. The family history includes T2DM and hypertension. The patient is not obese (BMI of 26)  and a non-drinker.   The patient presented to the vascular clinic with a 1-month history of severe  worsening pain in his right lower leg  even at rest  associated with non-healing ulcers on his right foot. Upon examination  absent pulses were found in his right foot along with evidence of tissue loss. Emergent lower extremity angiography revealed extensive atherosclerotic disease with complete occlusion of the right SFA (Superficial femoral artery) and popliteal artery.  Management and Outcome: Given his high cardiovascular risk and critical symptoms  an endovascular first approach was employed. A successful infrainguinal angioplasty was performed  resulting in improved perfusion to the affected leg. Post-procedural care included dual anti-platelet therapy  glycemic control  statin for lipid control  and rigorous wound care to facilitate ulcer healing. Patient's pain improved significantly with advancing wound healing observed at the 4-week follow-up. Smoking cessation was forcefully recommended for the prevention of disease progression.  Discussion: CLI is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality  especially among African-Americans  who show a higher prevalence of PAD. This case highlights the vital importance of risk factor modification and timely intervention in the management of these patients. In combination with a patient-centered approach  this case underscores the need for comprehensive secondary prevention strategies for risk reduction and disease progression in the African American community.  Conclusion: This case report underscores the unique complexities when managing patients from high-risk  underserved populations  like African-Americans. A patient-centered and comprehensive secondary prevention strategy must be a crucial component of CLI management to improve limb salvage rates and slow disease progression.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,50,Title: Case Report: Bilateral Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient   Patient Information: A 79-year-old Afro-Caribbean female patient presented with severe pain in both lower extremities  worsening over the course of three weeks. The patient resided in a suburban area  was a widow  and lived with her daughter's family. She had been a primary school teacher by profession  with a history of moderate tobacco and alcohol use. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 18 years prior and hypertension for approximately 10 years. There was no family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) or any other vascular disorders.   Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Assessment: The patient exhibited rest pain  non-healing ulcers on the feet  and impaired mobility  indicative of Rutherford class 5 critical limb ischemia (CLI). She reported intense pain in both legs  magnified during the night. Physical examination discovered diminished peripheral pulses  with skin being cool to touch  dry gangrene of digits in the left foot and non-healing ulcers on the dorsal aspect of the right foot. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was calculated to be less than 0.40 bilaterally  and Doppler ultrasound revealed occlusions in proximal  middle  and distal segments of both lower limb arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention  Follow-up  and Outcomes: The initial management included administration of analgesics for pain relief  and intensive control of blood glucose levels  blood pressure  and lipids. After discussion with the vascular surgeon  it was decided that the patient was a high-risk candidate for revascularization procedures due to age  diabetes  and hypertension. Therefore  the treatment strategy included the initiation of potent antiplatelet therapy  statin therapy  and a diabetes management plan including insulin and metformin. Limb salvage attempts were made via wound care management including debridement  biologic wound coverings  and off-loading techniques to promote wound healing.  After six months of rigorous follow-up and frequent modification of medications  the patient reported moderate pain relief and a significant improvement in overall mobility. The ulcers showed signs of gradual healing  and there were no further episodes of gangrene or need for amputation. The patient continues to remain under intensive management and surveillance.   Conclusion: This case highlights the complexity and challenges faced in managing an elderly patient with bilateral CLI with significant comorbid conditions. Timely identification  holistic approach  and rigorous control of risk factors could possibly prevent amputation and improve quality of life in such patients. Further research is needed to develop better treatment strategies and to understand disease progression and outcomes better in similar subsets of patients.   Confidentiality: Respecting the patient’s rights  any identifying information has been changed to maintain anonymity. The patient provided verbal and written consent for the usage of her medical history.   Keywords: critical limb ischemia  elderly patient  diabetes  hypertension  peripheral artery disease.

Age: 52 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Truck driver Residence: Rural Georgia  Introduction:   Mr. E. R  a 52-year-old Caucasian male presented with severe  debilitating pain in his right calf which had been escalating for the past six weeks. The pain was persistent even when at rest and particularly more severe at night. He also reported skin discoloration and a non-healing wound on his right heel.   Past Medical History:   The patient has a 20-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is also a heavy smoker for more than 30 years with an estimated pack year history of 60.   Clinical Examination and Diagnosis:   On examination  his right lower limb was cold with markedly diminished pulse. His right foot appeared discolored with a poorly perfused  non-healing ulcers on the heel. The rest of the examination  including cardiovascular and neurological examination  were unremarkable. The clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was confirmed through an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) test  which revealed a value <0.3 in the right foot  which is indicative of severe arterial disease.   Management:   Given the severity of CLI and the risk factors at play  the multidisciplinary vascular team decided to proceed with angiography that confirmed multifocal significant artery disease in the right leg. The patient underwent successful revascularization using balloon angioplasty and placement of drug-eluting stents  followed by intensive wound management. Aside from the necessary medical intervention  the patient was counseled to undertake serious lifestyle modifications  including regular blood glucose level monitoring for diabetes management  cessation of smoking and increased physical activity.  Summary:  This case highlights the costly impact of uncontrolled diabetes and chronic smoking  both of which are significant contributors to the development and progression of peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia. There is an urgent need for proactive patient education and both targeted and systemic interventions in order to reduce the burden of CLI  particularly in demographic groups represented by the patient described in this case report.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,52,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged African American Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the severe stage of peripheral artery disease  compromises the extremities' blood supply  leading to progressively worsening symptoms  ranging from rest pain to tissue loss  making timely diagnosis and treatment imperative.  Patient Information:  We present a case of a 52-year-old African American woman  a resident of North Carolina  who was admitted to the hospital with severe rest pain in her left leg along with ulcerations on her foot  indicative of advanced stages of CLI. She is a retired school teacher  non-smoker  and non-alcoholic. Her family history shows that her father had a myocardial infarction at age 60  and her mother has hypertension.  Clinical Findings:  The patient reported escalating pain in her left leg over the past few weeks  particularly at night worsening her sleep. She also noted the gradual darkening of her left foot's toes with a nonhealing ulcer on her left heel. She has no history of trauma or injury to the left limb. Her BMI was 32 kg/m2  indicating obesity.  Medical history:  She has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  poorly controlled with oral antidiabetic agents. She was diagnosed with hypertension four years ago and has been on antihypertensive medications. She has no known allergies but takes daily aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention.  Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  her left foot showed signs of tissue necrosis with a dry gangrenous left fifth toe and a non-healing ulcer on the heel. Pulses in the left lower extremity were non-palpable with a significant decrease in the capillary filling time. Ankle-brachial index of the left limb was 0.40 suggestive of severe ischemia. Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenosis in her left limb's peripheral arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention:  She was started on aggressive control of her blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Based on the extent of arterial blockage seen in the imaging studies  the patient underwent endovascular intervention with successful angioplasty and stenting of the major occluded segments of her left lower limb arteries.  Follow Up:  Her symptoms improved significantly post the intervention with pain score reducing by 50% on the second post-op day. At the one-month follow-up  the ulcer showed signs of healing  and pain had significantly reduced  restoring her sleep cycle.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of identifying and aggressively managing risk factors like diabetes and hypertension in patients with CLI to prevent disease progression and complications. Community awareness about peripheral artery disease should be promoted  especially among high-risk populations  so that early signs and symptoms are not overlooked  ensuring timely intervention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,53,Title: Chronic Limb Ischemia in a Middle-aged Male Patient with an Established History of Type 2 Diabetes and Smoking: A Case Report  Introduction:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe condition characterized by chronic ischemic at-rest pain  ulcers or gangrene in one or more limbs predominantly caused by atherosclerosis. It's an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  carrying a poor prognosis with an increased risk of limb amputation and cardiovascular morbidity. CLI is often associated with comorbid conditions like diabetes and smoking. This case report brings forth a patient with a prolonged history of smoking and an established diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who presented with CLI.  Case Presentation:  A 57-year-old African-American man presented in an outpatient clinic with symptoms of chronic rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his left foot for the past eight weeks. As an ex-smoker  he had a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit ten years ago. Since the age of 45  he has been living with T2DM  managed with metformin and a well-regulated diet. The patient also disclosed occasional alcohol use and a sedentary lifestyle. He had a past medical history of hypertension and was on medication. No known drug allergies were reported.  On physical examination  the left foot appeared pale with two non-healing ulcers on the dorsum and heel. Decreased pulses were palpable in the left foot compared to the right one. Neurological examination suggested a decrease in sensation over the left foot. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90mmHg.  Laboratory investigations showed an HbA1C of 9.2% suggesting poor glycemic control and an elevated C-reactive protein. Lipid profile was abnormal with increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. Doppler study of the lower extremity showed severe blockage in the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.  The patient was diagnosed with CLI associated with T2DM and previous smoking based on clinical presentation  medical history  and investigation findings.  Discussion:  CLI is a serious condition associated with high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is frequently found in diabetic patients  older individuals  smokers  and those with high cholesterol levels. This patient’s past history of smoking and poorly controlled diabetes increased his risk of developing severe PAD leading to CLI.   Management was multi-faceted  including revascularization to improve limb perfusion  aggressive control of modifiable risks  wound care measures  and patient education about diabetes management  foot care and the importance of lifestyle modification.   Conclusion:  Our case underlines the importance of stringent risk factor control in high-risk individuals  timely diagnosis and early intervention for CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,54,Title: Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Caucasian Male   Patient Demographic Information:   The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired blue-collar worker and lives in an urban area of central California. He is a former smoker with a 60 pack-year history and admits to moderate alcohol use. The patient comes from a lower-middle-class socioeconomic status and reports limited physical activity.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a significant medical history including type II diabetes which is managed with Metformin  chronic hypertension controlled by Lisinopril  and high cholesterol which is regulated by Simvastatin. Moreover  the patient had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation 8 years prior to the current presentation. No family history of peripheral arterial disease was reported.  Presentation:  The patient arrived at the emergency department in a wheelchair  reporting severe rest pain in his right leg for the last 2 weeks  especially at night. He also reported numbness and a cold feeling in the right foot along with noticeable weight loss.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a pale and cold right foot with noticeable atrophy of the calf muscles. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were absent in the right foot but present on the left side. The patient showed a delayed capillary refill time of over 3s in the affected foot. Pain scales rated the rest pain at 7/10. There was no ulceration or gangrene present  however  the patient reported occasional night-time foot cramps.  Diagnosis:  Taking into account the absent foot pulses  critical rest pain  loss of subcutaneous tissue  foot pallor and muscle atrophy  along with the patient’s medical history  a clinical diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made. It was further confirmed by an Ankle-brachial index (ABI) assessment  which showed a value of <0.4 for the right leg. A subsequent Doppler ultrasound revealed severely reduced blood flow in the right popliteal artery and the anterior and posterior tibial arteries which confirmed the diagnosis of CLI.  Treatment:  The patient consented to a right leg percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent placement in the above-mentioned arteries. The procedure was successful  and the patient was discharged with instructions to take aspirin 75mg/day  and clopidogrel 75mg/day for dual antiplatelet therapy. The patient was also instructed to continue his previous medication and follow up with a vascular surgeon and a physician. He was also offered assistance to quit alcohol and physical therapy to improve mobility.  Follow-up:  At the 6-month follow-up  the patient reported significant improvement in the rest pain and was able to walk short distances with assistance. The right foot appeared warm with normal color  and the dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable. Efforts were made to further control the patient’s risk factors to prevent the recurrence of CLI.  In conclusion  this case study emphasizes the serious nature of Critical Limb Ischemia and the importance of early recognition and immediate intervention to avoid limb loss  especially in high-risk patients with a history of diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,55,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 69-year-old African American Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries that significantly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. This case report discusses the diagnosis  management and treatment journey of a 69-year-old African American male patient with CLI.  Patient Information: The patient  a 69-year-old African American male  presented with progressive pain in his right lower limb over the past six months. He is a retired construction worker and long-term resident of Philadelphia. He lives with his wife and has a 40-year history of cigarette smoking (approximately one pack per day). His past medical history is relevant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He does not have a family history of peripheral vascular diseases.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient had a pale right foot with cold touch  absent distal pulses  and an ulcer around the medial malleolus. The patient rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. He also reported intermittent claudication in his right leg  non-healing foot ulcer  and erectile dysfunction.   Diagnostic Assessment: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed  which showed readings of 0.5 in the right leg  indicating severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially managed non-surgically with statin  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and aggressive glycemic control for diabetes. Furthermore  he was advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption. Despite such measures  the pain in the right lower limb and the ulcer did not improve then surgical intervention was considered. The patient underwent successful right lower extremity bypass surgery  with an infrainguinal bypass graft using autogenous saphenous vein.  Follow up and Outcome: Post-surgical follow-up at 6 weeks  3 months  6 months and then annually showed patent bypass on Ultrasound-Doppler. The claudication was resolved  and the ulcer healed completely over the 4 months after surgery.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief from the crippling pain and was compliant with smoking cessation  regular exercise  and diet control. He expressed satisfaction with the treatment and management plan.  Conclusion: This case highlights that globe and presentation profile of CLI is diverse and needs customized strategies. The successful management of this case reinforces the importance of an aggressive  multi-disciplinary approach in dealing with CLI  especially amongst patients with multiple comorbid conditions.

Case Report:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old African American male presented with non-healing ulcers in the right foot associated with severe rest pain for the past 3 weeks. The patient reported that he had been suffering from intermittent claudication and that the symptoms had progressively worsened during the last few months. The patient was a long-term smoker with a 40 pack-year history and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years back  which had been poorly controlled. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Findings and Investigations: A physical examination revealed cyanotic right foot  diminished pulses in distal arteries  and severe pain during rest. The right foot dorsalis pedis pulse was not palpable and ankle-brachial index of the right foot was 0.3. An ulcer was found on the plantar surface of the right foot  showing signs of infection.  Investigations included a complete blood count  serum biochemistry to assess renal function  HbA1C  lipid profile and arterial duplex ultrasonography. He had high HbA1C and lipid levels  indicating poor control of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia based on the clinical presentation and imaging results.  Treatment: Endovascular revascularization of the right lower limb was performed since the patient's general condition was not suitable for surgery. A multi-disciplinary team  including a diabetologist  cardiologist  and vascular surgeon  was summoned for optimal control of risk factors and wound management.   Outcome: The patient showed clinical improvement with resolution of rest pain and decreased size of the ulcer. He was discharged with advice on lifestyle modification and optimal control of risk factors to prevent further development of arterial disease.  Discussion: Critical limb ischemia is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Demographics  such as being an older  African American male  and medical history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension predisposed the patient to the disease. Early detection and management  control of risk factors  and interdisciplinary co-operation are crucial for the optimal outcome in these patients.   Conclusion: This case highlights the complex interactions of demographic characteristics and personal health behaviors in determining the risk  presentation  and management of critical limb ischemia.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,57,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old African American Female  Introduction: This case report discusses the diagnosis  management and treatment outcome of a 68-year old African American woman diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) that presented in an outpatient vascular clinic.   Case Report:   Patient Information:  Our patient is a 68-year-old African-American woman  retired teacher  non-smoker  BMI 34 Kg/m2  living in an urban setting. She has no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. She presents with a six-month history of progressive pain in her left lower limb  particularly on walking  which has recently worsened to rest pain.  Clinical Findings:  The patient reported feeling a throbbing  aching pain  described as a 7 on a 10-point pain scale  in her left calf accompanied by numbness and coolness in the foot. Pain increased with movement and reduced with rest elevation. She also reported intermittent claudication with minimal exertion  and a few ulcerations on the posterior aspect of her left foot that had not healed for about 2 months.  Patient's Medical History:  The patient has a known history of systemic hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years. She has been on antihypertensive medications and oral hypoglycemic drugs. She denies experiencing any chest pain  shortness of breath  or other systemic symptoms.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Physical examination revealed decreased temperature in the affected limb  loss of distal pulse  and trophic skin changes - dry  shiny  and discolored with loss of hair. The ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) was 0.65 in the left leg which confirmed the diagnosis of CLI. Vascular Doppler ultrasound showed a significant reduction in the blood flow to the left leg and confirmed arterial occlusive disease. Blood tests showed an elevated HbA1c level of 9.1%  and lipid profile was deranged; LDL was 160mg/dl  and HDL was 32mg/dl.   Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-up:  Inspecting the severity of ischemia and patient’s age  she was managed with endovascular intervention which included angioplasty and stenting to restore blood flow. Post-procedure  a regular follow-up program was instituted that comprised ABI readings  wound evaluation counseling for diabetes and hypertension management  and discussions on lifestyle modifications like maintaining a healthy weight  exercising regularly  and adhering to a diabetic-friendly diet. Over a period of six months  her leg pain reduced  and the ulcerations on her foot showed signs of healing.  Discussion: CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries that significantly reduces blood-flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. CLI is more prevalent in the African American community  and it is also noted that they present with more advanced disease  and experience worse outcomes. This case report provides valuable information on the clinical manifestation  diagnosis  management  and outcome of a patient with CLI which is an emerging dilemma  especially in aging patients with hypertension and diabetes.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,58,Case Report: A 68-Year-Old Male with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented to the vascular clinic with a six-month history of progressive pain in his right lower limb. The pain was associated with non-healing ulcers on the foot and toes. The patient stated that he was unable to walk even short distances due to the painful discomfort. Moreover  he reported experiencing resting pain for the past month that impeded his sleeping at night.   Medical History  The patient has a significant 20-year history of type II diabetes mellitus and suffered from hypertension for the past 15 years  both of which were being managed with medication. He has been a smoker for more than 45 years and still smokes approximately 15 cigarettes a day. Previous medical records state he also underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery following an episode of myocardial infarction seven years ago. There was no notable family history of vascular disease.  Examination and Diagnosis  Physical examination revealed absent pulsation in the right femoral  popliteal and pedal arteries. Skin of the right lower leg and foot appeared shiny with noticeable hair loss. Two ulcers of approximately 1 cm in diameter each  with necrotic bases were noted on the dorsum of the foot and the tip of the second toe. No signs were observed of local infection. Doppler ultrasound and angiography showed severe peripheral occlusive disease in the right limb  with multilevel stenosis and occlusions in femoral and below-knee popliteal arteries.   The patient was thus diagnosed with critical limb ischemia  indicated by the presence of chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  and evident limb threat due to severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). CLI risk in this case was attributed to a long history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and background of coronary artery disease.  Rehabilitation and Follow-Up  A consensus team decision requested revascularization by angioplasty and stent placement to restore blood flow. With follow-up monitoring  the patient displayed resolution of rest pain and gradual healing of his foot ulcers. He also attended smoking cessation counseling and his diabetic control was managed intensively by the endocrinology team.  Patient Education  The patient was educated on the symptoms of CLI reoccurrence and the need for regular follow-ups. He was advised to manage his risk factors  including adherence to his diabetes and hypertension medications  maintaining a healthy diet  and abstaining from smoking.  Conclusion  This case underpins CLI’s importance in patients with long-standing risk factors  which  combined with objective vascular investigations  allowed for a timely diagnosis and immediate revascularization. It further emphasises the need for stringent management of CLI risk factors and comprehensive patient education for effective disease management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,59,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic Patient: A Case Study  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease that severely obstructs arteriolar blood flow to the extremities  leading to rest pain  non-healing wound or gangrene. Diabetes mellitus greatly increases the risk of CLI. Herein  we present a case of a 69-year-old Caucasian male with a history of diabetes mellitus  who was managed for CLI.  Patient Information and Clinical Findings: A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented to the vascular clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his right foot accompanied by persistent non-healing skin ulcers over the past four months. The patient stated that the pain usually gets extreme during the night that disturbs his sleep frequently. The pain intensity was 8 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale. He denied any sudden weight loss  fever  trauma  or any drug allergies. Patient's past medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2 for over 10 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack year history of smoking. His medications included metformin  atenolol  and atorvastatin. He lived alone and was a retired teacher.  Physical examination revealed multiple ulcers on the dorsum of the foot and a noticeable decrease in temperature below the ankle joint. Additionally  the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable. The blood pressure in his right ankle was significantly lower than in his arm  indicating severe peripheral arterial disease.  Diagnosis  Therapeutics Interventions  and Outcomes: Following the clinical examination  an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test was done which showed a value of 0.4  confirming the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. The patient was also scheduled for angiography  which displayed severe long-segment stenosis in the right popliteal artery and multiple stenosis in the tibial arteries.  Considering the patient's condition and the extent of arterial involvement  an endovascular intervention was planned. The patient underwent angioplasty and stenting  and a combination of low molecular weight heparin and dual antiplatelet therapy were initiated. The patient's diabetic medications were adjusted  and he was strictly advised to quit smoking.  After the procedure  an improvement was noticed in the patient's pain and the ulcers started to heal. The patient was discharged with prescriptions and was referred for regular outpatient follow-ups at the vascular clinic.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early identification and appropriate management of CLI in diabetic patients. Careful control of blood sugars  aggressive management of atherosclerotic risk factors such as smoking cessation  and prompt revascularization can help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CLI. It requires a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons  endocrinologists  and primary care physicians to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,60,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 62-year-old African American Male with Diabetes Mellitus  Introduction  This is a case about a 62-year-old African American male diagnosed with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Clinical Findings  The patient  a retired plumber  presented with pain in his right lower extremity. The pain worsened on walking (intermittent claudication) and at times even at rest. He also reported the presence of painful non-healing ulcers on his right leg. Notably  he was a chronic smoker with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which were poorly controlled over the years.  Examinations  Physical examination revealed bluish discoloration (cyanosis) and evidence of gangrene in the toes of the right foot. Peripheral pulses in the right lower extremity were barely palpable. Further  Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was documented at 0.3 indicating severe peripheral artery disease. Doppler ultrasound revealed significantly reduced blood flow in the right lower limb.   Treatment  Following discussions about his prognosis and management options  the patient was admitted and initiated on anticoagulant therapy. Balloon angioplasty was attempted for revascularization since the patient’s symptoms did not improve. However  prior severely calcified vessels made the procedure unsuccessful. Eventually  the patient underwent right leg below the knee amputation (BKA). He received rehabilitation post-BKA  and his pain was completely resolved.  Outcome and Follow-Up  The patient was discharged and scheduled for regular follow-ups managing his diabetes better  promoting smoking cessation to preclude further vascular compromise in the unaffected limb.  Patient's Perspective  The patient acknowledged his prognosis and expressed relief from the debilitating pain following the amputation. He agreed to enact lifestyle changes  chiefly cessation of smoking  and better management of his diabetes.  Discussion  This case illustrates the challenges that clinicians face while managing CLI  primarily in patients with diabetes  whose vessels are too often calcified to permit angioplasty or other vascular interventions. This scenario is especially common among African American male patients who have higher rates of limb loss due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Conclusion  Physicians should not only focus on escalating treatment strategies for CLI but also emphasize the importance of primary prevention strategies like optimal glycemic control  smoking cessation  and regular foot care.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,61,Title: Diagnosis and Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged African American Female  Case Report:  Patient Information and Demographics:  The patient is a 52-year-old African American female who presented with a history of progressive pain in the right lower extremity at rest  extending from her lower leg to foot. She resides in an urban area and leads a lifestyle including history of long-term smoking and a diet high in saturated fats  identified as decisive factors majorly contributing to the condition. The patient is unmarried and lives alone  thus showing a lack of support system necessary for health management.   Medical and Surgical History: The patient has an extensive past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia; all these elements being under poor control. She also has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD). No history of surgeries reported before.  Clinical findings: Physical examination revealed coldness  pallor  atrophic changes  and thickened nails in the right lower leg and foot. Distal pulses were not palpable  and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly low  at 0.45. Additionally  she reported a worsening of symptoms over the past month with the onset of ischemic pain at rest  additional to non-healing ulcers on her foot.  Diagnosis: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was primarily diagnosed based on clinical evaluation  followed by the markedly low ABI and color Doppler ultrasound indicating reduced blood flow in the right lower extremity. The patient's history of diabetes  hypertension  and PAD also led to probable CLI.  Therapeutic intervention: Initial interventions aimed to alleviate symptoms and prevent disease progression included lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation counseling  dietary changes  and strategic foot care. Pharmacological treatment involved antiplatelet therapy  pain management  and improvement of her current diabetic and lipid-lowering agents' regime.  Given her extensive PAD and non-reconstructable vessels noted on angiogram  she was not deemed a candidate for surgical revascularization  leaving her dependent on optimal medical treatment and pain management.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient responded fairly well to the medical treatment with the partial healing of her ulcers and reduced pain levels. However  continuous monitoring and robust follow-up plans were made  given the severity and chronic nature of CLI and her overall poor health due to multiple comorbidities. Regular assessments of her ABI and Doppler studies were planned alongside tweaking her medicinal regime as necessary.  Discussion: This case underscores the prevalence of CLI in African American women  particularly with risk factors including diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Additionally  it highlights the importance of early identification  risk factor management  and an individualized approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for CLI. Regular follow-up is crucial because of the high risk of disease progression and complications  leading to potential limb loss.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,63,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic  Hypertensive Patient  Patient Bio: This is a case study of a 68-year-old African American male patient from Boston  Massachusetts. He has a known medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus of around 20 years and Hypertension diagnosed a decade ago. He is a retired teacher and lives alone  although he imbued a habit of regular exercising like walking and light workout at home.  Presenting Concerns: The patient arrived at the emergency department with a 3-day history of severe pain in his left lower limb  especially at the calf region extending up to his foot. He noted the pain was constant and felt worse while resting. He also noticed coldness and a tingling sensation in the left foot and a non-healing wound on the sole of his foot.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  his left foot was cooler compared to the right. Absent pedal pulses were palpated in both left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. His blood pressure measured was 160/90 mm Hg. His blood glucose level was elevated. Doppler ultrasound confirmed lower blood flow in the left leg compared to the right. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was also determined which showed a significant reduction on the left side (ABI = 0.4). The patient also showed signs of apparent gangrenous changes at the distal end of his left foot.   Timeline: The patient presented symptoms three days before admission and was admitted for immediate medical attention. Over a course of 7-10 days  the patient underwent diagnostic tests like blood tests  a Doppler ultrasound  imaging  and specialized tests for his lower limb.   Diagnostic Assessment: Imaging and Doppler confirmed a critical limb ischemia diagnosis  consistent with the patient’s history of Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. The patient was discussed with the vascular team considering revascularization benefits and risks.  Therapeutic Intervention: Patient received intravenous rehydration and pain management. He was initially started on an appropriate dose of insulin to control his blood sugar levels and antiplatelet agents. Upon consultation with the vascular team  an endovascular procedure was recommended. Post-procedure  the wound was managed using a combination of antibiotics  wound dressings  and offloading techniques.   Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was discharged after 15 days of stay in the hospital. Scheduled follow-up after 1 month showed significant improvement in his symptoms. The wound had begun to heal  and there was improved blood flow in the limb. His HbA1c and blood pressure started to reduce and were on the way to reach the recommended guidelines.  Patient Perspective: The patient was extremely compliant and appreciated the improvement in his symptoms.   Teaching Points/Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of regular follow-ups and strict management in diabetic and hypertensive patients. Early diagnosis and treatment of critical limb ischemia could potentially avert limb amputation and significantly improve the quality of life. It also underscores the critical role of an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to the management of complex cases like this one.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,64,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 64-year-old African American Female with a History of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Introduction:  This report presents the management of a severe case of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a 64-year-old African American female with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. This case is of particular importance considering African Americans are often underrepresented in clinical research despite having higher prevalence rates of peripheral arterial disease which often culminates to CLI.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 64-year-old retired African-American female  known with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  hypertension for 10 years and hypercholesterolemia for five years presented with one-week history of excruciating pain in the right lower limb that had worsened over the past two days. The pain was severe enough to cause sleep disturbances. Additional complaints included progressive discoloration of the foot  previously unnoticed  and inability to walk due to pain. The patient denied smoking or alcohol consumption and had a family history of atherosclerosis.  Physical examination revealed a bedridden patient with palpable but weak femoral pulse and absent foot pulses on the right side. Observed skin changes included a bluish foot with cold  shiny skin and the presence of necrotic tissue on the toes. Patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia given the presence of rest pain  non-healing wounds and weak or absent pulses.  Initial laboratory evaluation revealed elevated blood glucose levels  increased lipid profile and elevated C-reactive protein indicating a possible infection. The patient subsequently underwent an angiogram  which revealed severe stenosis in the distal part of the superficial femoral artery and occlusion in the popliteal artery extending to the trifurcation.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy considering the suspected foot infection. Strict blood sugar control was maintained with insulin therapy  and lipid lowering medications were continued to control hypercholesterolemia. Pain was managed with opioid analgesics.  Following the multi-disciplinary team meeting  the patient was considered for Revascularization  given the non-healing wounds and severe pain. Balloon angioplasty was conducted with successful revascularization of the popliteal artery and trifurcation  which resulted in the patient's post-operative pain relief.  At one-month follow-up  the patient reported resolution of rest pain and improvement of foot discoloration. Wound healing was also noted with deceased necrotic tissue and no signs of infection.  Conclusion:  This case report highlights the importance of both early detection and intervention in patients with CLI  particularly in high-risk group such as African Americans with a high burden of Type 2 Diabetes. Adequate glycemic control  lipid management and lifestyle educational programs should be considered for this population to lower the risk and delay progression of peripheral arterial disease and its end stage manifestation  CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,65,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Diabetic Male Patient  Patient Information:   A 68-year-old African American male patient presented at the clinic. The patient lives in a suburban neighborhood within an urban setting. He is a retired elementary school teacher and currently lives with his wife. The patient is a non-smoker and doesn't consume alcoholic beverages. He doesn't have any allergies but has a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia are managed with medication. About five years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and was consistently under medical management.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient reported a progressive pain in his left leg over the past few months  which intensified within the last two weeks. He reported the occurrence of intermittent claudication after walking short distances and rest pain  particularly at night. His left foot was notably colder than the right one. He also mentioned an ulcer that had developed on his left toe that was not healing well.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination revealed an overall well-appearing but obese man. Notable findings include weak or nonpalpable pedal and posterior tibial pulses in the left leg. Examination of the left foot showed dry and unretractable skin  severe pallor when elevated  delayed capillary refill  and a non-healing ulcer over the distal phalanx of the left great toe. No sensory loss was identified in the foot.  Investigations:  An ankle-brachial index was done which reported 0.3 for the left side and 0.9 for the right side  indicating a significant reduction in blood flow on the left. Comprehensive blood tests were conducted  and the results were within the normal range  except for raised HbA1C level and slightly elevated total cholesterol level. A peripheral angiogram suggested a significant blockage in the left popliteal artery.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation  physical examination  and investigations  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD) was made.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was admitted and underwent a successful bypass surgery. Regular follow-up visits have been planned for the assessment of limb functionality and vascular status. The management of his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia is being optimized to reduce the risk of disease progression.

Resident of a suburban area  he was brought in by his daughter with a complaint of severe rest pain in his right lower limb for three weeks. He reported the pain was getting progressively worse  affecting his sleep and quality of life.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) for the past 22 years and chronic renal disease (stage 3b)  managed conservatively for the previous 8 years. He has been a lifelong non-smoker and has not been consuming alcohol. He was being treated for hypertension for the last 9 years. He denied any history of coronary artery disease or stroke. His medications included metformin  ramipril  atorvastatin  and amlodipine.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a non-healing  painful ulcer measuring 1.5 cm × 2 cm on the right toe. His right lower limb was cold with absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses but intact radial and femoral pulses. Neurological examination showed diminished sensation in a glove-stocking distribution.   Investigations: Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated HbA1c level (9.6%) and serum creatinine level (2.6 mg/dL)  indicative of poorly controlled DM and deteriorated renal function  respectively. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.3 in the right lower extremity  pointing towards severe peripheral artery disease. A Doppler ultrasound study confirmed multi-level infra-inguinal arterial occlusive disease.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and findings  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Management and outcome:  The patient received aggressive risk factor modification  including glycemic control and hypertension management. He underwent minor foot amputation and revascularization through endovascular angioplasty to restore blood supply to his foot. Post-operative recovery was satisfactory  with good foot perfusion and wound healing. He was also started on dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrence.   Discussion:  In this case  the patient's long-standing DM and renal disease  common risk factors  might have contributed to the development of peripheral artery disease and ultimately CLI. Despite being a non-smoker  the patient developed severe CLI  emphasizing that DM and kidney disease can independently escalate the risk of severe vascular diseases. This case highlights the importance of aggressive risk factor management and early diagnosis of CLI in patients with DM and renal disease.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,67,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Male with Diabetes Mellitus and PVD  Introduction:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood-flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. This case report presents an incident of CLI in a 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease.   Case Presentation: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented with rest pain in the left lower limb  non-healing ulcers on the left foot  and weight loss for the past two months. He's a retired school teacher  living with his wife  a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol occasionally. He had been previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) for 15 years and Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) for the past five years.   Medical History:  The patient has been under treatment for diabetes mellitus with Metformin and Glipizide alongside hypertension with Lisinopril. He has also been receiving Clopidogrel for his PVD. He has no known allergies  and his immunizations are up-to-date. Family history includes father dying from myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and mother having diabetes mellitus and hypertension.   Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the left foot showed two ulcers: one on the big toe and another on the heel. Pulses were absent in the left foot  but palpable in the right. Also  the ankle-brachial index was less than 0.4 for the left limb. Peripheral neuropathy was indicated by reduced sensation in the foot. A BMI calculation showed the patient underweight at 16.7 kg/m^2.   Investigations: Blood investigations demonstrated high blood sugar levels and elevated creatinine levels. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL and triglycerides whereas HDL levels were reduced. Doppler ultrasound showed severe stenosis on the left femoral artery and moderate stenosis in the right. ECG hinted towards left ventricular hypertrophy with no signs of acute ischemia.  Diagnosis: These clinical  radiological and laboratory findings confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia in the left lower limb in our patient. The patient's critical limb ischemia is complicated by his diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease.  Management: The patient was referred to the Vascular surgery department where he underwent successful endovascular intervention for his stenosis. Post-surgical period was uneventful. He was also counselled for tight glucose control  diet management for weight gain and foot care.   Conclusion: The patient's age  gender  and history of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease are risk factors that contributed to the development of CLI. This case report highlights the need for early detection and aggressive management of these risk factors to prevent the development or progression of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,68,Title: A Case of Critical Limic Ischemia in a Post-menopausal African American Woman with Type 2 Diabetes and Uncontrolled Hypertension  Patient Profile: The patient  Mrs. X  is a 61-year-old African American female  originally from South Carolina  USA  currently residing in New York City. She is post-menopausal and has had two pregnancies with no complications. She is a former smoker  having quit nearly 15 years ago  but she reports high alcohol consumption.   Presenting Issue: Mrs. X presented herself to the hospital with severe rest pain in the left lower limb  especially the foot. According to the patient  the pain had been continuous for the past week and was more intense at nights. She also highlighted a history of ulcers on her left foot. She has suffered previous minor amputations on the same foot due to non-healing wounds.   Past Medical History: Mrs. X has had a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes  which she claims is managed by diet and oral hypoglycemic medications. She also has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years  treated irregularly with beta-blockers. She has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago and has been on statin therapy. She has an annual flu shot and has her vaccines up to date. Her last check-up was six months ago  where she also undergone a mammography  with normal results. She had a minor stroke 3 years ago and since then she was put on low dose aspirin.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  she had palpable femoral and weak popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses on the left side. She also had a palpable and painful mass in her left calf muscle. Mrs. X has a body mass index (BMI) of 31.2  falls in the obese category.   Test Results: A duplex ultrasound showed a significantly reduced ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) (<0.4) which is severe arterial disease. A magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed multi-level stenosis with complete occlusion at some sites in the left leg. Glycemic control was poor  evident from HbA1c level  which was 8.3%.  Diagnosis: On the basis of clinical history  physical examination  and diagnostic tests  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) with underlying severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was established.  Clinical Management: Revascularization was deemed the best management strategy  and she was referred to the vascular surgery department. Given the serious nature of her condition  she was also advised to consult with the pain and wound management teams and to seek diabetes and hypertension care medical advice to help optimally manage her blood sugar and blood pressure levels.   In Conclusion: This case underscores the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia and the development of CMD. African American women like Mrs. X are especially susceptible to these risk factors and resultant conditions  and therefore  must be monitored for the symptoms of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,69,Title: Acute Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Male Patient with Underlying Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Peripheral Arterial Disease  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian male (Mr. A) presented to the emergency department with severe rest pain and intermittent claudication mainly in his left lower extremity. His past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a current smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history and disproportionately higher alcohol consumption.   His pain has persisted for the past two weeks but has recently escalated in severity over the past three days. It was associated with non-healing necrotic ulcers over his left foot  suggesting critical limb ischemia (CLI). Upon physical examination  noticeable pallor was seen below the knee  with an absent dorsalis pedis pulse on both sides and a weakened popliteal pulse on the left side.  Further investigation with duplex ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the left lower limb  confirming the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest was calculated as 0.45 left and 0.90 on the right  further solidifying the diagnosis. No significant electrocardiographic abnormalities were noticed in his chest X-ray or EKG.  Medical History:  Mr. A was diagnosed with T2DM and hypertension 18 years ago and has since been on oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensives. For the last seven years  he has reported other concomitant diagnoses  including PAD and hyperlipidemia  which were being managed by statin therapy.   Over the past two years  his Peripheral Arterial Disease symptoms have been progressively worsening. His management involved lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and exercise  along with antiplatelet agents  statins  and cilostazole. Unfortunately  his noncompliance with medical advice - predominantly his inability to quit smoking and control his alcohol consumption - has contributed to the acceleration of the PAD and onset of CLI.  Discussion:  The demographic data of Mr. A correlates with the typical patient profile we encounter with CLI - elderly  male  smokers  diabetics  and patients with hyperlipidemia or underlying atherosclerotic disease. In addition  his case reflects a dramatic manifestation of PAD that is accelerated by his non-compliance with advised lifestyle modifications. Compounded by the patient's underlying T2DM  this acute presentation underscores the need for immediate and aggressive therapy to salvage the limb and avoid grave complications.  Patient’s condition warrants immediate revascularization intervention. Given the patient's presentation and medical history  a comprehensive multidisciplinary team approach  paired with intensive glycemic control  complete cessation of smoking  management of his other comorbidities  improved diet  and regular exercise  will be critical in managing this aggressive form of PAD.  The case serves as a stark reminder of the severe implications of poor lifestyle choices  non-compliance with medical advice  especially in patients with multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. Early recognition of PAD  aggressive control of the risk factors  and patient education might prevent limb-threatening situations like CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,70,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Male Patient with A History of Diabetes and Hypertension  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which significantly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Case Report:  Patient Information:   The patient is a 75-year-old African American male residing in an urban area in Texas. The patient presented with rest pain and intermittent ulcers on the right foot. His background includes a 30-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  a 25-year history of hypertension (HTN)  and a 10-year history of hyperlipidemia. The patient is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history with cessation 15 years ago. He was on consistent medical treatment for his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Findings:  The general examination revealed an ulcer on the right lower extremity on the dorsum of the foot. The patient complained of severe  uncontrolled pain on his right foot. Upon physical examination  distal pulses in the lower extremities were absent. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.40 on the right leg and 0.70 on the left leg suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram which revealed severe extensive multi-level peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the infrapopliteal vessels of the right lower extremity consistent with critical limb ischemia.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the patient’s severe pain and the non-healing ulcer  clinicians decided to perform an urgent right lower extremity bypass surgery. Heavily calcified vessels made endovascular intervention less feasible. Successful bypass surgery was performed from the right common femoral artery to the right posterior tibial artery using reversed saphenous vein complicated by early graft thrombosis necessitating urgent graft thrombectomy.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Over a 6-month follow-up period  the patient showed significant improvement in his symptoms of rest pain and the ulcer on the right foot completely healed. He continues to come in for regular follow-ups and takes all prescribed medications as directed.  Patient Perspective:  The patient reported that his quality of life had significantly improved following the intervention and he was glad to have made the decision to undergo the surgical procedure.  Conclusion:  The case highlights the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of CLI in patients with a history of long-standing diabetes and hypertension which are significant predictors for the development of peripheral arterial disease. The need for continuous follow up for these patients is also emphasized to monitor the function of the graft and to manage the associated risks and complications.

It manifests as chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene in one or both lower limbs due to objectifiable arterial occlusive disease. This report describes the case of a 60-year-old Hispanic female patient who presented with CLI.  Case Presentation  Patient Information  The patient is a 60-year-old Hispanic female  originating from Mexico  with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She does not smoke or drink alcohol  and lives in a suburban area. She is unemployed and lives with her husband. The patient is of medium build and does not engage in regular physical activity. She complains of a 6-month history of increasing muscle pain in the lower limbs that initially occurred only during exercise but has progressed to persistent  at-rest pain.  Clinical Findings  Clinical examination revealed an ulcer on the distal aspect of the right food  coolness of both feet  a diminished pulse in the right lower limb  and absent pulse in the left lower limb. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment  Laboratory investigations revealed elevated HbA1c levels  indicative of uncontrolled diabetes. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) indicated severe peripheral artery disease in both lower extremities. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography showed critical stenosis in the superficial femoral arteries bilaterally with three-vessel runoff in the left foot and one-vessel runoff in the right foot. The diagnosis of CLI was based on the patient's history  clinical findings  and these diagnostic assessments.  Therapeutic Intervention  Given the severity of her disease  the patient was referred for a consultation with cardiovascular surgery. She underwent successful right lower limb revascularization with stent placements in the femoral artery. The left lower limb angioplasty followed 6 weeks later. The patient also initiated a regimen of aspirin  statin  and ACE inhibitors in addition to stringent control of her diabetes and hypertension.  Outcome  Following the interventions  the patient reported significant improvement in her symptoms. The foot ulcer healed progressively over the ensuing weeks. At 3-month follow-up  the patient had no rest pain and both feet were warm with palpable pulses. ABI values of bilateral lower extremities were improved from preoperative values.  Conclusion  Early detection and effective management are imperative in managing CLI. This case emphasizes the need for prompt attention and meticulous care in patients with risk factors for CLI  particularly those with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension.

He is a retired electrician  married with three grown-up children. He is a lifetime non-smoker with a moderate intake of alcohol.  Presenting Condition: The patient presented to the outpatient clinic with progressive pain in his left leg that had worsened over the past six months. The pain was particularly severe at rest and often disturbed his sleep. On examination  his left foot was cold to touch  with an absence of distal pulses. There were multiple non-healing ulcers over the ankle and dorsum of the foot.  Past Medical History: Notable past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus  which was diagnosed 18 years ago and has been managed with oral hypoglycemic medication. He also has a 10-year history of hypertension managed by a combination of ACE inhibitors and calcium blockers. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or previous strokes. The patient also has a documented history of peripheral artery disease diagnosed five years ago but had rejected any intervention at that time. The patient's medication list also shows that he is on statin therapy for management of hypercholesterolemia.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings and his medical history  a preliminary diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made. This was later confirmed with color Doppler ultrasonography showing severely diminished blood flow in the left distal external iliac and femoral arteries.  Management: Given his advanced age  comorbidities  and severity of disease  the patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team consisting of a vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  and interventional radiologist. The team decided on an endovascular revascularization approach for managing his CLI. His diabetes was managed more stringently  and he was advised lifestyle modifications including a diabetic diet and physiotherapy for intermittent claudication.  Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance of early detection of peripheral vascular disease  especially in high-risk patients such as diabetics. The timely intervention of the multidisciplinary team and the chosen endovascular approach may yet have a substantial impact on the quality of life for this elderly patient.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,76,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia In a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Female With Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) typically presenting as chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene due to arterial insufficiency. The following case report describes a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Case Description: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female resident of Ohio  USA. She is a retired school teacher and currently lives on her own. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day  a habit she started in her 20s and has not been able to quit. She does not consume alcohol regularly.   The patient presented to the clinic complaining of non-healing sores on her left second and third toes  accompanied by rest pain for two weeks. The pain was severe  reducing her sleep  and was relieved slightly by hanging the leg over the edge of the bed. She also complained of burning and numbness sensation in her left foot. Physical examination revealed weakly palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the left lower limb. There were ischemic ulcers over the 2nd and 3rd toes on the left foot and dry gangrene on the tip of the 3rd toe.  With her clinical presentation  the working diagnosis was critical limb ischemia. A Doppler ultrasound evaluation showed reduced arterial blood flow in the lower left limb. Angiography further confirmed multi-level arterial occlusive disease in the left lower limb  with significant stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery.   Management: Given her critical limb ischemia with diabetes mellitus  she was initially managed with rigorous wound care  optimal control of her blood glucose levels  and pain management. To address her extensive atherosclerotic blockages and to attempt limb salvage  she underwent endovascular revascularization with angioplasty and stent placement.   Post-procedure  the patient was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy along with tight glycemic control medications and lipid-lowering drugs. She was advised to quit smoking and was referred to a smoking cessation program. The patient was followed closely with regular evaluations of limb perfusion and wound healing.  Conclusion: This case highlights the significant morbidity associated with CLI  particularly among elderly  diabetic  and smoker patients. It is essential to optimize the management of these risk factors to help prevent the development and progression of CLI.    Clinical Lesson: Early evaluation and intervention in patients at high risk for CLI can result in improved outcomes and possibly limb salvage. This report serves as a reminder for clinicians to be vigilant and consider CLI as a potential diagnosis in patients with similar risk profiles presenting with lower extremity complaints.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,77,Title: Evolving Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in an 68-year Old African American Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe presentation of peripheral arterial disease resulting in a significant risk for limb loss. It is typically characterized by ischemic at-rest pain  skin ulcerations  or gangrene. We present a case of a 68-year-old African American male patient with critical limb ischemia.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old African American male presented with severe pain in right lower limb for the past three months. The pain was progressively getting worse  duration of approximately one to two hours  often awaking the patient at night. Past medical history was significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 30-year history of tobacco use.  Physical examination revealed skin discoloration  trophic changes  and ulcerations on the heel of the right foot. Pedal pulses were absent and foot was cold to touch indicating a compromised peripheral blood supply. The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was 0.50 on the right side further supporting the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. The patient also had a history of intermittent claudication  but it was resolved by rest previously.  Patient underwent a duplex ultrasound that showed triphasic waveforms in the common femoral and popliteal arteries but monophasic waveforms in the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. A subsequent arterial Doppler showed severe occlusive disease in the leg with no evidence of blood flow below the knee.  Management: CLI such as in our patient is a medical emergency often necessitating revascularization. Due to the advanced disease  an amputation at his right lower limb was determined to be the best course of action after discussion with the patient. His post-operative course was uneventful  and he was discharged on the fifth day with instructions for wound care  antiplatelets  statins  and an intensive rehabilitation regimen.   Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of peripheral arterial disease before it advances to CLI. African American ethnicity  a history of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes are notable risk factors for CLI  as was observed in the patient. Furthermore  it has provided an impetus to aggressively modify risk factors and advance surgical management when needed to prevent limb loss. Future research is needed to focus on improving the detection  prevention and treatment of this critical condition.

It is associated with a high risk of amputation  cardiovascular events  and death. This case report describes a patient with CLI with co-morbid Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  Case Presentation: We report the case of a 72-year-old Asian male  retired  with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  who presented with severe rest pain in the right lower extremity and necrotic ulcer at the right big toe. The patient resides in a suburban area  is a non-smoker  and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His medications include Metformin 1000mg twice daily for diabetes  Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension  and low-dose Aspirin as a prophylactic measure. He denied any allergies  alcohol use  or illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was noted to be in obvious distress due to pain. His right foot was pale with a necrotic ulcer of approximately 3cm in diameter at the right big toe. The right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were non-palpable. Doppler ultrasound examination showed monophasic waveforms in the right leg with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.45.  Management and Outcome: The limb-threatening nature of his condition necessitated urgent intervention. The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy and pain management. Angiography revealed severe stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. Subsequently  he underwent successful endovascular therapy with balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the right lower extremity  followed by minor amputation of the necrotic right big toe. The patient's condition improved significantly  and he was discharged with recommendations for strict glycemic control  continuation of antihypertensive medications  and low-dose Aspirin.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early detection and aggressive management of CLI  particularly in patients with common risk factors like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Optimal control of these co-morbidities is crucial to prevent the occurrence and progression of CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,79,Title: Successful Management of a 63-year-old African-American Female with Critical Limb Ischemia  Abstract:  A case of critical limb ischemia(CLI) in a 63-year-old African-American female presenting with rest pain in the left lower limb  confirmed via angiography.  Introduction:  CLI represents risk of limb loss and a significant negative impact on quality of life. African Americans exhibit higher rates of CLI  possibly due to disparities in healthcare access.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 63-year-old African-American female presented to the outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of increasing pain at the left foot even at rest and a non-healing wound over the dorsal aspect of the left foot. The patient is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history that she quit 5 years ago  has hypertension  controlled with medication  and was diagnosed with type II diabetes a year ago. She reported a family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Physical Examination:  Inspection revealed a blackened ulcer on the dorsal aspect of her left foot  with palpable pulses. Pain was elicited during flexion of the foot. The rest of her extremities had palpable pulses without signs of ischemia.  Investigations:  Doppler ultrasound showed an ankle-brachial index of 0.4 for the left limb  suggestive of severe arterial insufficiency. Subsequent angiogram of affected limb showed total occlusion of the left popliteal artery and tibial arteries with no visible distal vessels.  Treatment:  Given the severity of the disease and high risk of limb loss if untreated  the patient was advised for a surgical approach. A femoro-popliteal bypass surgery was performed using a prosthetic graft. Postoperative period was uneventful  with improved blood flow in the left limb documented via Doppler ultrasound.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient’s rest pain was significantly improved post-procedure and showed substantial wound healing over the subsequent follow-up period. She was enrolled into a supervised exercise program and gets regular follow-ups for monitoring of graft patency and status of limb.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the successful management of CLI in high-risk populations  highlighting the importance of early detection and appropriate intervention in preventing complications such as limb loss. This case also underscores considering PAD in any diabetic patient with foot wounds not healing as expected.    Conclusion:  CLI can lead to serious sequelae if left untreated  especially in populations with a higher risk factor prevalence such as African American females. Early detection  timely surgical intervention  followed by rehabilitation plays a crucial role in the successful management of CLI.

Patient Information  A 63-year-old Hispanic male with a history of smoking for 40 years  hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and hyperlipidemia  presented to the outpatient clinic with debilitating pain in his lower limbs. He complained of severe rest pain in both legs with worsening symptoms over the last six months. According to the patient  the pain  described as a burning and cramping sensation  occurred mainly at night and often interrupted his sleep. The pain was slightly relieved when he dangled his legs off the bed. In addition  the patient mentioned experiencing sores on his feet that seemed not to heal.   Clinical Findings  On physical examination  the patient had absent pulses in both his lower extremities  and a noticeable pallor present when his legs were elevated. Distal extremities were cold to touch  with noticeable muscle atrophy. There were also poorly healing ulcers as described  mainly on the toes of both feet. Non-invasive vascular examination showed significantly diminished ankle-brachial index (ABI) values representing severe peripheral artery disease (PAD).   Diagnosis and Treatment  A computed tomography angiogram confirmed extensive arterial occlusive disease from the infrarenal aorta to the arteries below the knee in both legs  consistent with a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   Considering his severe symptoms and disease extent  the patient was recommended for urgent revascularization. The endovascular approach was initially attempted. Balloon angioplasty of the infrarenal aorta  bilateral iliac  and femoropopliteal arteries was performed; however  due to the extensive involvement of below-the-knee arteries  the surgical team decided to proceed with a below-the-knee bypass surgery.   Follow Up and Outcomes  The patient showed significant relief from rest pain post-surgery. Wound care services were arranged for the management of foot ulcers. As part of his continued care  he is participating in a supervised exercise program for further rehabilitation.   More importantly  lifestyle modification discussion was encompassed with the aid of a multidisciplinary team. Especially  smoking cessation was emphasized considering the extensive role of smoking on the progression of his peripheral artery disease (PAD).   Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment of PAD  as it can progress to critical limb ischemia with devastating health consequences. It also emphasizes the need for aggressive lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation  diet modification  and routine exercise in managing PAD. This case highlights the fact that all patients  particularly ageing adults with risk factors like smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  should undergo regular assessment to avoid complications related to CLI.

He has a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient reports smoking 1 pack per day for the last 40 years. No known drug allergies were identified. His body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m²  suggesting obesity.  The patient's chief complaint is chronic pain in the right lower leg that had gradually worsened over the previous three months. Pain was severe and exacerbated by minimal activity and was relieved by rest. He also noted the appearance of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. The patient reported having intermittent claudication but denied any history of stroke or heart attack.   In addition to his primary health issues  the patient’s past medical history includes dyslipidemia  peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease. His current prescriptions include Metformin  Lisinopril  Amlodipine  and Atorvastatin. The patient has a family history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Physical examination revealed xerotic skin and ulceration on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the patient’s right foot. The leg was cold to touch  with hair loss evident. Pedal pulses were absent on the right foot  suggesting compromised blood flow.   Investigations:  A Doppler ultrasound revealed significant stenosis in the right femoral artery. Performed ABI (ankle-brachial index) test showed significantly lower values for the right leg (ABI=0.4). Blood tests showed elevated HbA1c (8.8%)  indicating poor glycemic control and increased creatinine levels (2.4 mg/dL)  suggesting deteriorated kidney function.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation  and imaging studies  the patient was primarily diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  secondary to his uncontrolled diabetes and long-term smoking habit.  Management and Outcome:  Patient was referred to vascular surgery for revascularization procedure  which successfully improved the blood flow. The underlying diabetes was optimized with insulin therapy. The patient received smoking cessation counseling and was started on a low-sodium  diabetic-friendly diet by the dietitian. Multidimensional rehabilitation was arranged for the patient  including physical therapy and mental health support. After 6 weeks of follow up  patient's leg ulcers showed significant improvement and the claudication pain was much relieved.   This case report illustrates the multidisciplinary approach in managing critical limb ischemia  the severe form of peripheral arterial disease primarily linked to diabetes  smoking  and hypertension. Regular monitoring  patient education  and optimal control of underlying risk factors are crucial to preventing progression and complications.

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,84,Title:   Critical Limb Ischemia Presented in a 70-year-old African American Woman: A Case Report  Introduction:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) represents one of the severe stages of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This condition is accompanied by different symptoms like rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene due to chronic ischemic rest pain. CLI is particularly observed in adults over 70 years and is more prevalent in African Americans.   Case Report:  The patient  a 70-year-old African American woman  with a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes mellitus type II  and a 35-year history of smoking presented to our hospital with complaints of chronic severe pain and non-healing wound over her left foot for the past two months. Patient-related her pain to become worst at night  disturbing her sleep  and alleviated somewhat by dangling her left foot over the side of the bed. She also reported progressive fatigue and weight loss recently.  Physical examination revealed a shallow  ulcerated lesion  approximately 3cm in diameter with foul-smelling purulent discharge over the left foot's dorsal surface. She also had notable coolness to touch and an absence of left foot pulses. The patient had diminished sensation to touch and pinprick on her foot.   Investigations included a comprehensive metabolic panel  complete blood count  ankle-brachial index (ABI)  and doppler ultrasound. Her ABI index was 0.4 on the left  suggestive of severe arterial disease. Doppler ultrasound confirmed an occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery with monophasic flow in the posterior tibial artery. Laboratory tests revealed hyperglycemia and increased inflammatory markers.  Given the patient's symptoms and the results of clinical investigations  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) due to uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and chronic smoking was made.  The patient was counselled about the seriousness of her condition and advised to quit smoking immediately. Antibiotics were prescribed to manage the wound infection  and peripheral angioplasty was planned. The patient was also referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.  Discussion:  This report illustrates a typical case of CLI in a high-risk patient who is elderly  hypertensive  diabetic  and a chronic smoker  demographic and risk-factor characteristics that coincide with those identified in literature regarding CLI. Essential to the clinical care provided were early detection  aggressive control of modifiable risk factors (smoking  diabetes  hypertension)  and the immediate address of the infection.  Conclusion:  Critical Limb Ischemia requires timely diagnosis and management. Primary care clinicians need to view patients holistically  investigating symptoms  signs  and risk factors for PAD and CLI. This is especially true for high-risk groups such as elderly African American females with conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Early detection can mitigate the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of amputation or even death. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,85,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged Male with Longstanding Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Case Report  Abstract This case report details the presentation  diagnosis  and management of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in a 68-year-old male with a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Case Presentation  Mr. A  a 68-year-old African American male with a history of long-standing PAD  hypertension  and type-2 diabetes mellitus  presented to the emergency department with a 6-week history of progressive worsening of severe rest pain in the right lower limb  which was non-responsive to traditional analgesics. The patient also reported progressive weight loss and had a smoking history of 30 pack-years.  On examination  his right lower limb was cool to touch with noticeable pallor and dependent rubor. Moreover  decreased sensation  particularly to light touch and temperature  was found distal to the ankle. The posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right were not palpable. The left lower limb was unaffected.  Investigations and Diagnosis  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) assessment recorded an index of 0.40 on the right  confirming a severe arterial compromise. The duplex ultrasonography showed evidence of multi-segmental atherosclerotic disease with extensive calcification  with notable obstructions in the femoropopliteal and tibioperoneal trunk.  The clinical presentation of rest pain  non-healing ulcers  absence of peripheral pulses  and the findings from the ABI assessment and duplex ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Treatment  The patient was initially started on analgesics for pain management  along with strict glycemic control and optimization of hypertension.  He was evaluated by vascular surgery  and based on the extent of the disease  the patient underwent successful endovascular revascularization of the right lower extremity involving balloon angioplasty with drug-eluting stents in the superficial femoral and the tibioperoneal arteries.   Follow-up and Prognosis Post procedure  the foot pulses were palpable and the skin color normalized. He was transitioned from analgesics to anti-platelet medication and a statin  and continued with strict glycemic and blood pressure control  along with smoking cessation counseling. A follow-up ABI assessment revealed an index of 0.91.  Discussion  This case reinforces the association between CLI and peripheral arterial disease in the presence of risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. Early diagnosis and prompt management of CLI can prevent limb loss. The case emphasizes the role of extensive cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle modifications in addition to procedural management.   Patient consent for publication Consent was obtained from the patient for publication. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,86,Title: A Case of Critical Limic Ischemia in an Elderly Male  Patient: 71-year-old Caucasian male  This report presents a case of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a 71-year-old Caucasian male. He is an active outdoor enthusiast  married with three children  and a veteran of the Vietnam War.  Presenting Complaint: The patient attended the vascular clinic complaining of severe  persistent leg pain of his right lower extremity that had significantly worsened over the last three months. The pain  which was initially intermittent  is now constant and even disrupts his sleep. He also reported potential claudication  discoloration of the skin  ulcers  and non-healing wounds in the right foot.  Medical History: The patient’s medical history includes: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (for the past 10 years)  hypertension  and a 40 pack-year history of smoking (ceased 1 year ago). He underwent a successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure due to ischemic heart disease 5 years ago. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) or other cardiovascular diseases.  Physical Examination: On examination  his right foot appeared pale and cold to touch  with weak peripheral pulses in the popliteal and posterior tibial arteries. Noted two ulcers on the lateral aspect of the foot  absence of hair growth on the limb  and significant atrophy of the calf muscle.   Investigations: His ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly reduced to 0.4 on the right  and duplex ultrasound showed significant stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery and complete occlusion of tibial arteries. He was referred urgently for a CT angiogram which further confirmed these findings. His HbA1C level was elevated at 9.2%.  Diagnosis: Based on the findings  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral arterial disease  primarily likely the result of his long-term smoking and poor glycemic control related to diabetes mellitus.   Treatment: The patient was taken in for urgent revascularization surgery; open bypass graft was performed using a vein from his other leg. Subsequently  he was advised to have fully optimized pharmacotherapy  including control of diabetes  hypertension  dietary changes  smoking cessation  cholesterol management  and an antiplatelet agent. Further wound management for his foot ulcers was also started with regular dressings and antibiotics.  Follow-up: He was followed up one month later. Keep in mind that CLI represents an advanced stage of vascular disease  therefore continuity of care must be maintained  and close follow-ups must be scheduled.  This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of risk factors accountable for the development of PAD. It also highlights the need for more public health awareness about PAD  especially in the elderly and patient groups with known risk factors such as smoking and diabetes mellitus.

Demographic Information: This patient lives in a rural area of Idaho and is the primary caregiver for her husband who has Parkinson's disease. English is her native language  and she has a high school education. There is limited access to healthcare in her area  causing significant delay in her ability to seek medical advice.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a 20-year history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  for which she is on oral Metformin but has been inconsistent with monitoring her blood glucose levels and nutritional diet. She also has Hypertension and Mild Chronic Kidney Disease (Stages 1-2)  also poorly controlled due to her non-compliance with medication. Other significant history includes a 45-pack year smoking history  excessive alcohol intake and obesity (BMI of 32.2 kg/m2). She has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed observable gangrene in the digits of the right foot  absence of distal pulses in the right lower limb   and coldness of the affected limb compared to the left.   Investigations: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  which recorded an ABI of less than 0.4 on the right side. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed severe peripheral arterial disease in the right lower limb with extensive atherosclerotic plaques causing severe stenosis. Blood reports showed elevated fasting and postprandial glucose levels  elevated HbA1c (9.2%)  and mild renal impairment.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings and investigations  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral arterial disease exacerbated by uncontrolled T2DM was made.  Treatment: Multidisciplinary strategies involving vascular surgeons  endocrinologist  dietitian and wound care specialists were employed to manage her complex case. She underwent successful revascularization procedures. Her uncontrolled T2DM was managed with an insulin regimen. Wound care management for her non-healing ulcers was provided  and she was referred for comprehensive rehabilitation therapy.  In retrospect  this case emphasizes the importance of adequate glycemic control in T2DM patients and underscores the need to raise patient and healthcare provider awareness regarding the early signs of CLI to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment. It underscores the need to have a robust healthcare system in place that can cater to individuals living in rural areas to minimize healthcare disparities. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,88,"Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-year-old Male Smoking Patient with Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a two-day history of sharp pain in his left lower extremity that had been progressively worsening. He also complained of coldness in the affected limb accompanied by pallor and numbness. His family history was significant for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) including his mother and older brother.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at the age of 50  hypertension  and 40 pack-years of tobacco smoking which he still continued at presentation. His HMx includes no prior surgeries or interventions but had been on Metformin for diabetes and Losartan for hypertension. He had not been compliant with these medications as documented in his medical records over the past year. He also reported having intermittent claudication symptoms for the past 3 months but neglected it owing to the assumption that it was related to aging.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed that the patient had an absent left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. His left foot was notably colder than the right with a noticeable pallor. An ABI was calculated with it being less than 0.5 on the affected side  compared to the normal right side.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given his clinical presentation and physical examination findings  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was suspected. Further imaging including a duplex ultrasound and angiography confirmed significant stenosis in the distal superficial femoral artery and tibial arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient's uncontrolled diabetes was addressed by adjusting his Metformin regimen and initiating a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. Based on the severity of stenosis from diagnostic images  and considering the patient's significant symptomatology and risk factors (smoking and poorly controlled diabetes)  it was decided to pursue an endovascular approach involving balloon angioplasty and stenting over the site of stenosis.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Following intervention  the patient was educated on smoking cessation  adherence to medications  diabetic control  and the importance of regular follow-ups. He was also urged to participate in a supervised exercise program upon recovery. After six months  the patient markedly improved with no recurrence of his initial symptoms nor development of any post-procedure complications.  Patient Perspective:  """"I noticed my symptoms but I didn't really think they were serious. I'm glad the doctors acted quickly. It made me realise the importance of taking my medications regularly and trying to quit smoking.""""  Informed Consent:  The patient provided consent for this case report to be made with assurances of the confidentiality of his identity.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the impact of delayed healthcare seeking behavior  non-adherence to medication  and uncontrolled risk factors in the progression of PAD to CLI. It also emphasizes the vital role of early intervention in symptomatic patients to prevent adverse events such as limb loss or cardiovascular complications. This case underscores the need for primary care practitioners to be vigilant regarding PAD in high-risk patients and timely referral for specialist input."

Critical Limb Ischemia,7,90,Title: A Case of Critical Limic Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Male Patient  Patient Profile Mr. S  a 78-year-old Caucasian male presented to the vascular surgery service with complaints of pain in his right lower extremity that has been ongoing for the past six months. He is a resident of a suburban community and lives with his wife. Mr. S retired from his job as a mechanic 13 years ago.  Medical History Mr. S has a notable history of type II diabetes mellitus for about 28 years  managed mostly with oral hypoglycaemic agents. He also reportedly has hypertension and a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit 5 years ago. The patient has been compliant with his prescribed medications: metformin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril.  Clinical Presentation The patient complained of pain located in the right calf muscle that occurred on walking short distances (approximately 50 feet). Over the past month  the pain has progressed to occur even during rest  awakening him from sleep. He also noticed a slow healing ulcer on his right big toe's tip. He denied any significant weight loss  loss of appetite  or fever. Examination of the lower limbs revealed a pallor in the distal right foot compared to the left  capillary refill was prolonged  and right side dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were diminished.  Hospital Course Further evaluations  including an Ankle-Brachial Index and Duplex ultrasound of lower extremities  were indicative of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) involving the right limb. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis  showing multi-level occlusive disease with popliteal artery involvement. The managed care team decided to proceed with angioplasty for Mr. S with the anticipated need for stenting.  Mr. S was subjected to angioplasty with the stenting of the right popliteal artery. He tolerated the procedure well  and post-procedure  his symptoms dissipated significantly. The follow-up duplex scan exhibited improved blood flow in the right lower extremity.   Health Outcome Patient's right foot ischemic pain subsided  and his foot ulcer began to heal progressively under wound care measures. He was advised strict glycemic control with his current oral anti-diabetic medications  and the antiplatelet therapy was intensified. Patient was advised for a closer follow-up in the upcoming weeks to ensure complete healing of foot ulcer and to monitor his peripheral circulation.  Conclusion This case underscores the need for early recognition and management of PAD  particularly in high-risk populations such as elderly diabetic and hypertensive individuals. Moreover  it stresses the importance of regular vascular circulation follow-ups in these patients in order to prevent severe complications such as Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,91,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-year-old Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which notably decreases blood-flow  causing severe pain and even leading to skin ulcers or sores. This case study reports the clinical course of a 72-year-old male who presented with CLI.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X  a 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of persistent  unsettling pain in his left lower limb  particularly severe at night. Onset of pain was gradually increasing over the last six months. Besides  he complained of intermittent numbness  cold sensation  and rest pain in the limb. His medical history included Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 17 years  hypertension for 10 years  and he was a former heavy smoker  having left smoking about four years ago. The patient's current medications included Metformin 1000 mg once daily and Lisinopril 10 mg twice daily.  Physical examination showed mild pallor and absence of left foot pulses and diminished pulses in the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis. His blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg. Distal skin of the left foot appeared cyanotic with ulceration noted over the heel. Patient’s BMI was 27.8 kg/m2 indicating overweight status.  Investigations:  Complete blood counts showed a slight increase in white blood cells. Metabolic panel showed slightly elevated blood glucose and well-controlled hypertension. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was utilized to measure the severity of the peripheral artery disease  which showed a result of <0.4 – indicating severe CLI. Doppler ultrasound of left lower limb revealed decreased peak systolic velocities suggestive of significant stenosis. Fasting blood sugar was 140 mg/dl.  Treatment:  The patient was advised bed rest  along with optimal pain and diabetes management. Antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin) was started along with statins (Atorvastatin). As angiography showed severe multi-level atherosclerotic disease not suitable for endovascular intervention  the patient was referred for surgical bypass  which was performed successfully.  Follow-Up:  Upon follow-up after three weeks  the patient reported an improvement in rest pain  and the ulcer was noted to be healing well. The patient was further counseled on lifestyle modifications and tight control of diabetes and hypertension.  Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of early diagnosis and prompt intervention in patients with CLI  particularly in those with an underlying condition such as diabetes and hypertension. Furthermore  it reinforces the necessity for lifestyle modifications in the management of CLI  including cessation of smoking  healthy diet  weight management and regular exercise.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,92,Title: A case report of critical limb ischemia in a 68-year-old male with a history of Diabetes Mellitus and Hyperlipidemia  Patient Information: A 68-year-old African-American man presented to the vascular clinic with severe rest pain in his left leg that had been worsening over the past three weeks. His medical history included Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)  Hyperlipidemia  Hypertension  and a 30-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily. His medications included Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. He had no known allergies. Consumption of alcohol was minimal  and he lived alone.  Clinical findings: Upon physical examination  the patient's left foot was cold to touch  with diminished peripheral pulses  dry skin  and hair loss over the anterior shin. He also had an ulcer on the left heel with a dimension of 2x3 cm  with a necrotic base and surrounding erythema. His right leg revealed diminished but palpable peripheral pulses  and no ulceration was noted.  Diagnostic assessment: Blood investigations revealed HbA1c of 9.8%  Lipid profile was grossly deranged  and Liver and Kidney function tests were normal. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) on the left was 0.3  and on the right  it was 0.7. Given his history of DM and hyperlipidemia  coupled with the non-healing ulcer and severe rest pain  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was admitted to the hospital  where his foot was offloaded  and the ulcer was treated with daily dressings. He was started on Cilostazol and aspirin for the worsening ischemia. The vascular surgery team was consulted  and they recommended evaluation with an angiogram with a possible bypass procedure depending on the results. He was also referred to a dietitian to optimize his DM control and a smoking cessation program.  Follow-up and outcomes: Angiography revealed extensive disease in his left leg  so he underwent successful left iliac to dorsalis pedis bypass. The patient tolerated the procedure well with good flow noted to the distal artery. Post bypass  his rest pain resolved  and the necrotic base of the ulcer showed healthy granulation tissue. The patient was seen in follow-up at one month  three months  and six months  and his recovery remained good. At his six months follow-up appointment  his ulcer had completely healed  and he had given up smoking completely.  Clinical relevance: This case signifies the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in CLI to prevent amputation. Risk factor management  including smoking cessation  blood pressure control  and strict glycemic control  are crucial to prevent disease progression. The treatment of CLI is multi-disciplinary and includes vascular surgeons  internists  dietitians  and nurses for wound care.

The pain affected his quality of life significantly as it was limiting his mobility and interfered with his sleep.  Background:  Mr. A.B is a retired engineer who lives with his wife. He has a 40-pack-year history of smoking and quit last month. His alcohol consumption is moderate  and he follows a regular diet. He was diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus fifteen years ago. Besides  he also suffered from chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). His medications include metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  statins for his hyperlipidemia  and aspirin for cardio-protection.  Clinical Findings:  Upon clinical examination  the right lower extremity was marked by pallor  coldness  and diminished distal pulses. Trey's skin over his right foot was shiny  dry with no hair growth. There was non-palpable popliteal  posterior tibial  and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right side. There were no notable skin ulcers or gangrene.  Investigations And Diagnosis:  Laboratory investigations revealed a slightly elevated HbA1c of 7.6%  indicating uncontrolled diabetes  and an elevated creatinine level suggesting worsening of his CKD. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.3  indicative of severe ischemia.   A Duplex ultrasound showed a severe stenosis in his right superficial femoral artery  with compromised flow in distal vessels  supporting the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Management And Outcome:  The vascular surgeon determined Mr. A.B was suitable for an endovascular procedure. Following successful angioplasty and stenting  the man's pain was significantly relieved. He was educated about maintaining optimal foot hygiene and the importance of regular follow-ups. A multidisciplinary approach involving a diabetologist  nephrologist  dietitian  and podiatrist was planned to manage his concomitant conditions optimally.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of early detection and treatment of CLI in patients with multiple risk factors  chronic conditions  and a history of PAD. Though PAD is often underdiagnosed  doctors should keep a high suspicion in patients like Mr. A.B to improve their quality of life promptly and possibly prevent severe complications such as limb loss. Regular follow-ups are crucial in managing these patients holistically. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,94,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old African American Female with Diabetic History: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe condition of peripheral artery disease marked by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers or gangrene in one or both legs attributed to arterial occlusion. The incidence is higher among the African American population  adult males  and elderly patients. However  this report details a somewhat atypical case involving a 68-year-old African American female diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old African American female. She lives in a middle-class neighborhood in Chicago  is a retiree  and lives with her husband. She presented with complaints of chronic pain in her right lower limb  non-healing sores on the right foot  and a general feeling of fatigue.  Clinical History and Examination: The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all controlled with medications for over ten years. However  she has been a ircheduled wirelobacco smoker for 50 years. On physical examination  she appeared anxious. Her right lower limb was noticeably paler compared to the left. Her right foot showed dry gangrene changes with two non-healing sores.  Diagnostic Methods and Assessment: A peripheral Pulse Examination revealed weak pulses in the right lower limb. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly reduced in the symptomatic right limb. The patient's high blood sugar levels and HbA1c test suggested poorly controlled diabetes.  A computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) was used for further diagnostic evaluation  which revealed severe peripheral arterial disease with significant stenosis in the right femoropopliteal and anterior tibial arteries. Collectively  the patient’s symptoms  physical examination findings  and imaging studies qualified for a diagnosis of CLI as per the Rutherford Classification – Category 5.  Interventions: Initially  aggressive wound care  analgesia  and optimizing medical therapy for underlying diseases were initiated. As the risk of limb loss was high  revascularization was discussed. Endovascular intervention was considered first due to her age and multiple comorbid conditions  but she eventually underwent successful surgical bypass surgery due to the complexity of her lesions.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Post-surgery  the patient experienced considerable improvement in her symptoms. An ongoing treatment plan was designed which included consistent monitoring of her diabetic status  discontinuing smoking  regular exercise  and dietary changes. The patient also enrolled for follow-ups every six months to check for potential recurrence of arterial disease.  Conclusion: This case illustrates a somewhat peculiar case of critical limb ischemia occurring in an African American female. It emphasizes the importance of considering CLI in patients with typical symptoms and risk factors  regardless of demographic expectations. Prompt diagnosis  optimizing control of underlying diseases  effective revascularization  and comprehensive follow-up care are crucial in managing such cases to prevent limb loss and improve the quality of life. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,95,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene. It has a high morbidity and mortality rate and often occurs in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 58-year-old African American male  was referred to the vascular service with a two-month history of progressive pain in his left leg  exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest. He also reported a 6-week onset of persistent rest pain in his left foot. He is a two-pack-a-day smoker for approximately 40 years  and his medical history includes Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  hypertension (HTN)  hyperlipidemia  and existing coronary artery disease. His father had peripheral artery disease (PAD) and had died of myocardial infarction at age 67.   Examination revealed a weakly palpable left posterior tibial pulse  no palpable left dorsalis pedis pulse  and a non-healing ulcer on the left big toe. Popliteal and femoral pulses were palpable on the right leg. His body mass index (BMI) was 29 kg/m². The patient also exhibited reduced sensation in both feet on monofilament testing.  Investigations: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) readings showed reduced values in the left leg (0.5) indicating CLI. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed significant tibial artery disease in the left leg. Laboratory evaluations indicated poorly controlled T2DM with a Hemoglobin A1C of 9.2%.  Management and Outcome: The patient was started on optimal medical therapy including high-intensity statin therapy and antiplatelet therapy  strict glycemic control in collaboration with the endocrinology team  and counseled on the necessity for smoking cessation. Following discussions about the risks and benefits  the patient agreed to undergo endovascular revascularization. Subsequently  he successfully underwent angioplasty and stenting of the left tibial artery.  His post-procedure course was uneventful  and at a one-month follow-up  there was a marked improvement in his symptoms: the toe ulcer was healing  the rest pain had disappeared  and he had stopped smoking.  Conclusion: This case report underscores the importance of early detection  risk factor modification  and appropriate revascularization in CLI patients  particularly in those with co-existing T2DM  HTN  and a history of smoking. Baseline and ongoing assessment of peripheral pulses should be part of the annual review of patients with T2DM and assessment of patients presenting with leg or foot pain. Interdisciplinary cooperation  patient education  and strict risk factor control can significantly improve the prognosis of CLI patients. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,96,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 63-Year-Old Diabetic Male: A Case Report   Introduction: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe condition characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene in one or both legs attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease. CLI is particularly devastating among patients with diabetes mellitus. We describe a case of a 63-year-old male with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and newly identified CLI.   Case Description: Mr. A is a 63-year-old Caucasian male presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower extremity  particularly around the calf and foot  accompanied by visible skin ulcers. His pain was most apparent at night and partly relieved by hanging the leg over the edge of the bed.   His past medical history was remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 20 years prior  which had been managed with diet control  exercise  and metformin. He additionally had well-controlled hypertension  managed with hydrochlorothiazide. He had a 40-pack-year history of smoking  although he quit five years before his presentation. His family history was notable for a father who had peripheral arterial disease and an elder brother with coronary artery disease.   On physical examination  the left lower extremity was cool to touch distally  with a foot skin ulcer measuring two cm in diameter over the lateral aspect of the heel. There were no palpable pulses beyond the popliteal artery in the left leg  but dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were palpable in the right leg. Vascular Doppler confirmed the absence of pulse in the left anterior tibial  posterior tibial  and dorsalis pedis arteries.   Diagnosis & Management: The clinical presentation and imaging confirmed a diagnosis of CLI secondary to peripheral arterial disease. Upon consultation with a vascular surgeon  a decision was made to proceed with revascularization.  A successful left superficial femoral artery angioplasty and stent placement were performed  leading to a significant improvement in his symptoms. The ulcer started to show signs of healing over subsequent visits  and the patient was enrolled in a structured rehabilitation program.  Discussion: CLI is a life-threatening condition that presents amongst the most aggressive forms of peripheral arterial disease  especially among individuals with diabetes mellitus. Early recognition and aggressive management  including revascularization procedures  can improve limb salvage rates and overall quality of life. Lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation  diabetes control  and hypertension control are significant towards overall management.   Conclusion: This case advocates for proactive management of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension  particularly in individuals with a family history of vascular diseases. It also emphasizes the importance of early detection and timely intervention in managing CLI to prevent dire complications. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,97,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in an Elderly Male Patient with Diabetes and Prior Stent Placement: A Case Report  Patient Demographics  A 75-year-old Caucasian male  retired schoolteacher  presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe rest pain in his left leg  unremitting and intensifying over the past three days.  Past Medical History  The patient has a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which was first diagnosed a decade ago. He has been on oral antidiabetic medications but admits to imperfect adherence and dietary control. Additionally  he has a known history of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and underwent a successful right iliac artery stenting approximately 3 years ago to manage his peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Additional medical history includes hypertension  which has been controlled well by antihypertensive medications and moderate hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL and cholesterol levels)  managed with statin therapy. He denies any known heart disease or prior stroke events. The patient is a nonsmoker but has a 30-pack-year history smoking until a decade ago. He occasionally drinks alcohol and does not use any illicit drugs. The patient lives with his wife  and they are of middle socioeconomic status. There's no significant family history of vascular disease.  Current Presentation  On inspection  the patient's left leg showed signs of advanced ischemia  including pallor  with noticeable temperature difference as compared with the contralateral limb. The ankle pulses were non-palpable  and the popliteal pulse was weak. No obvious ulceration or gangrene was observed.  Investigations  Subsequent ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) revealed a value of 0.38 in the left leg  significantly indicating restricted blood flow. Duplex ultrasound showed stenosis and calcific atherosclerotic changes in the left iliac  femoral  and popliteal arteries. A CT angiogram confirmed these findings  along with thrombotic occlusion of the left distal superficial femoral artery and a patent right arterial stent.   Blood work revealed elevated HbA1c levels  poor renal function  and abnormal lipid metabolism.   Conclusion  This case highlights the complexity of care in managing critical limb ischemia in patients with additional comorbidities like diabetes and established PAD. Here  reintervention through endovascular techniques  intensive diabetic management  lipid control  antiplatelet therapy and lifestyle modifications have been considered for effective management of the patient's clinical condition. Still  he may need close follow-up and repeat vascular assessments. Appropriate education regarding disease management is also pivotal for the patient and family.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,98,Title: Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in a Technically Challenged Elderly Patient  Patient Identification:  An 83-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-year history of tobacco use was admitted to our vascular surgery department.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient complained about chronic pain at rest  non-healing wounds on the left foot  and difficulty in walking due to limb weakness for the past 6 months. The limb pain seemed to intensify during the night  compelling the patient to keep the limb in a dependent position.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient’s left limb was notably cooler compared to the right and sensory defects were present in the distal extremities. The left foot showed signs of critical limb ischemia (CLI) with trophic skin changes (thin  shiny  and hairless skin)  a non-healing ulcer on the left heel  and toe gangrene was also found.  Diagnostic Procedures: The patient underwent an ankle-brachial index test which showed a result of less than 0.4 on the left  indicating severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). Subsequent Doppler ultrasound and computed tomographic angiography revealed an occlusion of the left common iliac artery and below-the-knee arteries.  Treatment: Due to the patient’s age  combined with severe comorbidities  the decision was made to employ endovascular treatment with balloon angioplasty. A minimally invasive treatment approach was crucial in this case given the patient's advanced age and multi-morbid status to avoid possible complications related to open surgery.  Outcome: The patient’s post-procedural course was notable for considerable pain relief and improved limb temperature. The non-healing ulcer showed signs of healing and the gangrene did not progress further.  Follow-Up: The patient was discharged and enrolled in a home care program for wound care and physical therapy. They were advised to quit smoking and were offered pharmacologic assistance for the same. They were asked to maintain strict control of blood sugar and follow up with dieticians for medical nutrition therapy.  Key Clinical Message: Elderly patients represent a significant proportion of patients with CLI  particularly those with comorbidities like diabetes and smoking habits. This case demonstrates the effective role of endovascular intervention in managing CLI in a technically challenging  high-risk patient while also signaling the importance of ongoing supportive care in successful outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,7,99,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile:  Mr. J  a seventy-two-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the hospital with severe pain in both lower limbs  predominantly more severe in the right limb. He is a retired military officer  living with his wife. The patient is a smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history but otherwise endorses minimal alcohol intake. His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and moderately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed approximately ten years ago.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. J reported a three-week history of progressively worsening pain in both lower limbs  more significant in the right limb which led to interrupted sleep. He also reported claudication after walking a short distance and has noticed some non-healing sores on his right foot. The pain has subsequently limited his daily living activities as well as restricted his mobility. He has not experienced similar pain before.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed absent peripheral pulses in his lower extremities and bluish discoloration in the toes of his right foot. Further examination discovered ulcers on the dorsum of the right foot with minimal exudate but scanty granulation. His left foot showed early signs of skin breakdown without any ulceration.   Investigations:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was undertaken and the results were 0.50 on the right and 0.65 on the left. Duplex ultrasonography confirmed an occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery as well as a significant stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery. Contrast angiography confirmed these occlusions and also identified additional stenoses not previously seen on ultrasound.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings  patient history and imaging results  Mr. J was diagnosed with bilateral critical limb ischemia (CLI) with an increased severity in the right lower limb.   Treatment:  Mr. J was started on continuous regularly scheduled pain medications to manage his pain. After a multi-disciplinary team discussion composed of a vascular surgeon  cardiologist  and endocrinologist  Mr. J was scheduled for a right leg above-knee amputation given the unfavorable limb prognosis. Meanwhile  the left leg was managed medically with aggressive risk factor modification  including advice for smoking cessation  better control of diabetes  and dual antiplatelet therapy to potentially delay disease progression.  Creation of this case report emphasizing real-world patient with critical limb ischemia can foster a necessary understanding of the disease's natural history and management options  leading to better patient care.

Her weight was recorded as 78 kgs and height as 156 cm.  Chief Complaints:  The patient presented to the emergency department reporting severe pain  characterized as sharp and shooting  in her left lower extremity  particularly on walking  and even at rest for the past two weeks. The pain was associated with an inability to move the lower limb.  History:  The patient had a 35-year history of pack-a-day smoking  a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  and was known to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia for 15 years. She also reported a family history of coronary artery diseases.  Medical History:  Her prior medical history includes a stroke without residual deficit 3 years ago. The patient's medications included metformin  ramipril  and atorvastatin.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the left foot was noted to be cold when compared to the right. Absence of popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulse on the left leg was found. Pallor was noted on elevation  associated with dependent rubor. An ulcer measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm was noted on her left heel  suggestive of ischemic changes.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was evaluated and found to be less than 0.4  confirming severe peripheral arterial disease. Lower limb angiography showed occlusion of the popliteal artery with nonvisualization of anterior and posterior tibial arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  A decision was made to pursue percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement in the popliteal artery. Successful revascularization was obtained by endovascular techniques. The hypoperfused tissue was debrided and appropriate wound care was started.  Follow-up and Outcome:  Upon follow-up after six weeks  the patient showed significant improvement in pain and mobility. Limb salvaging was successful and the patient was advised on necessary lifestyle modifications  including quitting smoking  maintaining a healthy diet  and regular monitoring and control of her diabetes and hypertension.  Patient Perspective:  The patient was very much relieved from her pain and happy regarding her improved limb function. She is currently adhering to lifestyle changes and medication regime.  Teaching Points:  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and appropriate management of peripheral artery disease presenting as critical limb ischemia  especially in high-risk patients  such as those with a long history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. It also underscores the importance of timely referral to vascular specialists for limb-salvaging procedures.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,1,Patient Introduction:   Mr. John Doe is a 75-year-old African-American male patient  who had been admitted to a hospital located in Miami  Florida  USA. Mr. Doe is a retired bank officer and lives with his wife. He turned up to the hospital  complaining of severe unrelenting pain in his right lower limb  especially his right foot.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has had a long-standing history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which he has been managing with medication for the last 15 years. He had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure 7 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He has a 20-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily  but he quit smoking after his CABG procedure. His lipid profile shows dyslipidemia.  Family History:  His family history is significant with his father having suffered from a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at the age of 72 and a grandfather who had a below-knee amputation due to gangrene  secondary to peripheral artery disease. His older brother is currently managing his Type 2 diabetes.  Current Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI) of his right lower extremity. He experiences rest pain  characterized by a sharp  aching  or burning sensation at rest that usually worsen at night. He also displays non-healing ulcers on the lateral aspect of his right foot. Peripheral pulses were not palpable in the right lower limb. There was loss of protective sensation over the foot secondary to peripheral neuropathy accentuated by his longstanding diabetes.   Treatment Approach:  Upon diagnosis and considering his past medical history  a multidisciplinary approach was adopted. Vascular surgery consultation was sought. An angiogram confirmed multi-level occlusions in the right lower limb vessels. He was taken up for peripheral angioplasty and stenting for the same. Concurrently  the ulcers were treated by wound care services and antibiotics were started to prevent secondary infection.  In addition to this  lifestyle modifications were encouraged. Despite his cessation of smoking for seven years now  the patient was educated about its implications on his conditions. His diabetic control was suboptimal and the endocrinology team was involved in optimizing his glycemic control.   Conclusion:  His case represents the high risk associated with CLI in patients with advanced age  African American race  history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia and family history of cardiovascular disease. It also emphasizes the importance of early detection and management of CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,2,Patient Case Presentation   Name: Mr. Johnson  Age: 70 years  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Presenting Problem: Mr. Johnson presents with a two-week history of increasingly painful  non-healing sores on his left foot. He also mentioned resting pain in his leg  which seems to elevate while sleeping. He claims to have lost weight unintentionally and reports feelings of general fatigue.   Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a known history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the past 24 years  severe peripheral artery disease diagnosed 7 years ago and hypertension for 12 years. He also has a history of chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to longstanding diabetes. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He currently takes metformin  an ACE inhibitor  aspirin  and a statin.  Social History: Mr. Johnson lives with his wife in a rural area. He is a retired farmer with a 50-pack year history of smoking  but quit smoking after his CABG surgery.   Family history: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 64; mother had hypertension and died at age 70 of stroke. He has two siblings alive and well; one brother diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Clinical Assessment:  Patient appeared in discomfort due to pain; initial examination revealed an ulcer over left foot  with blackish discoloration of his toes. Pedal pulses were not palpable. An ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) was performed which demonstrated a decreased ABI in the left lower limb  indicating severe ischemia.  Diagnosis:  The combination of Mr. Johnson's non-healing wounds on lower extremities along with critical ABI values and chronic large vessel peripheral arterial disease directed towards a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Discussion and Management: Managing CLI involves treating risk factors  improving pain  healing ulcers  and possibly revascularization to prevent amputation. He may benefit from modification of his current medications and considering possible angioplasty or bypass grafting for the affected extremity. Due to the presence of multiple comorbid conditions  collaborative care amongst cardiologists  diabetologists  and vascular surgeons will be required.  Given Mr. Johnson’s significant medical history  age  lifestyle  and the severity of CLI  it will be crucial to manage his condition aggressively and promptly. This involves pursuing invasive therapeutic measures if recommended by specialists  along with the stringent control of his diabetes and hypertension. Wound care management  possible antibiotics and pain management will be vital aspects of his care. His condition should be closely monitored to watch for any signs of further deterioration or development of gangrene  in which case urgent surgical interventions might become necessary to save his limb. Support from nutrionist  physiotherapist  and psychological support will also be beneficial.  This complex case  like most associated with CLI and comorbid conditions  calls for multidisciplinary  patient-centered care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,3,Patient Profile  Mr. John Clarke  a 68-year-old African-American male  was admitted with symptoms indicating Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Past Medical History   Mr. Clarke has a history of Type 2 diabetes for over 15 years and has been managing it with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His uncontrolled diabetes resulted in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) two years ago. He has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He suffered a myocardial infarction approximately eight years ago and underwent a balloon angioplasty for coronary artery disease.  Presenting Symptoms   Mr. Clarke came to the clinic with the complication of a non-healing ulcer on his left big toe. He had been experiencing rest pain in the lower leg and the foot for several weeks and recently noticed a color change in the toes of his left foot. He reported experiencing intensified pain at night  and the pain decreased when he dangled his feet over the bed's edge.  Family History   Both of Mr. Clarke’s parents died from cardiovascular disease. His father at 65 from a stroke and his mother at 76 from a heart attack. His elder brother suffered from type 2 diabetes and underwent a below-knee amputation due to gangrene at 72 years.   Laboratory and Imaging Findings   A peripheral arterial Doppler study showed significantly reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI) in his left lower limb  indicating severe arterial insufficiency. An angiogram revealed multi-segment disease with occlusion of the popliteal artery and minimal distal runoff. Laboratory findings showed inadequately controlled diabetes (HbA1c: 9%) and dyslipidemia (LDL: 145 mg/dL).   Management  Given Mr. Clarke's medical complexity and poor distal runoff  he was considered a poor candidate for surgical revascularization. A decision was made to proceed with optimal medical therapy including aggressive risk factor modification. His diabetes management was intensified with insulin therapy. Pain control with opioids was necessary for his rest pain. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) and high-dose statin were initiated.   Prognosis   Critical Limb Ischemia poses a significant risk in terms of limb loss and mortality. Strict glycaemic control  effective management of dyslipidemia and tobacco cessation play a crucial role in prognosis. Early recognition  aggressive risk factor modification and when possible revascularization can prevent limb loss in a patient diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. The case  however  highlights the challenge in managing such patients with advanced PAD and minimal options for revascularization.   The importance of aggressive foot care  including the possible need for minor amputations to prevent progression to gangrene  has also been discussed at length with Mr. Clarke. Despite this  his prognosis remains uncertain  and he continues to risk potential limb loss and a reduced quality of life.   Discussions around advanced directives and palliative care services have also been initiated as part of a comprehensive care plan  given the seriousness of CLI and his complications. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,4,Patient Profile:   The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He is retired and based in Ontario  Canada. His partner informs that he has a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking about 15 years ago.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith was referred to the Emergency Department after he had been suffering from an intermittent  yet severe pain in his right lower limb  particularly while at rest. On observation  the limb appeared paler compared to the other leg and was cooler on touch. The pain was causing sleep disturbances as well.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of Type-II Diabetes Mellitus managed with Metformin. In addition to this  he was diagnosed with Hypertension 10 years ago  being managed with Amlodipine. He also has a history of coronary artery disease for which he underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stenting 5 years ago. There is also a mention of peripheral artery disease (PAD) but had not required any direct intervention previously.  Family History:  His father died at 65 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother passed away in her late 70s due to an unspecified cerebrovascular event. He has an older brother living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a younger sister diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Diagnosis:  The patient's symptoms  along with his history  pointed towards Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). A subsequent angiogram confirmed severe blockages in the distal right superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.  Plan:  Given his numerous comorbidities  invasive therapy like bypass surgery is high-risk. Therefore  Mr. Smith's treatment plan involved a conservative approach using a combination of pharmaceuticals (including antiplatelet and cholesterol-lowering medications)  wound care  rigorous blood glucose level monitoring  smoking cessation and supervised exercise.  Discussion:  Mr. Smith's case is not uncommon; PAD often underlies CLI and is estimated to affect approximately 12% of the adult population  with a higher prevalence amongst those above 70 years. PAD and subsequently CLI are associated with significant morbidity  and mortality  particularly among older adults who smoke  have diabetes  hypertension  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Modification in lifestyle  good control of blood glucose levels  blood pressure  lipid profile  and smoking cessation play a significant role in the management of CLI. Although the conservative approach was preferred initially for this case  endovascular or surgical intervention might be necessary if symptoms persist. The primary goal is to preserve the limb  improve function  and quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,5,Patient Information: Mr. E.F.  a 70-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker.  Presenting Problem: Mr. E.F. presents with severe and worsening pain in his right lower extremity which is triggered by activity and often continues at rest.   Past Medical History: The patient a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years  with irregular glycemic control. Other comorbidities include hypertension for 15 years  controlled with medication  and atherosclerosis for which he underwent a coronary artery bypass surgery 7 years ago. He has a history of smoking for 30 years (2 packs/day) but quit 5 years ago. He has no known history of allergies.  Family Medical History: His father expired due to myocardial infarction at the age of 63 and his elder brother has been diabetic for many years. There is no history of any genetic or hereditary disorders.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the right foot appears pale with weak peripheral pulses and slow capillary refill. Patient's right foot shows a non-healing ulcer on the plantar surface. Distal hair loss is evident  suggestive of poor circulation.  Diagnosis: The patient’s symptomatic presentation  history  and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Lab Results: Labs reveal evidence of poor renal function and an elevated HbA1c level of 8.7%  indicating poor glycemic control.   Imaging Studies: Non-invasive limb arterial Doppler ultrasound revealed right lower extremity arterial stenosis. Angiography confirmed multilevel arterial disease in the right leg.   Treatment plan: The patient was started on optimal medical therapy including antithrombotic therapy (aspirin)  statins  and antihypertensive drugs. He was also planned for revascularization through peripheral artery angioplasty or bypass  with an evaluation for potential amputation contingent on the viability of the limb after revascularization. Glycemic control was emphasized with a combined approach of diet  lifestyle modifications and insulin therapy under supervision of a diabetologist.   Follow-up: Regular follow-ups have been planned for monitoring and managing his diabetes  hypertension  and limb ischemia. Patient education emphasised on smoking cessation  maintaining foot hygiene  monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms like non-healing wounds  cyanosis or cold extremities.  Conclusion: Mr. E.F.'s case highlights the significant risk of CLI in patients with a history of smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease. It underscores the need for vigilant monitoring  optimal management of comorbidities  and early aggressive intervention for limb salvage. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,6,Patient Information: Mr. A  a 68-year-old African American male  presented to the outpatient department with complaints of leg pain and ulceration. Mr. A is a retired engineer  lives with his wife  and has 3 adult children.   Medical History: The patient has a 20-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus with a persistently elevated HbA1c level of 9.1% indicative of poor glycemic control. Other than that  he has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are managed with respective medications. He had myocardial infarction 5 years ago with no major complications.   Family History: Mr. A has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 62 and his older brother is living with coronary artery disease. His mother died of a stroke at 68. His eldest son has recently been diagnosed with diabetes.  Current Presentation: Mr. A came in with principal complaints of a non-healing  painful ulcer on his left foot for the past 3 months  progressive discomfort in his left leg  and a sensation of coldness in the leg especially at night. He mentioned episodes of intermittent claudicating—while walking short distances—which has increasingly limited his mobility. He also affirmed moderate to severe pain at rest. He denies trauma  fever  or systemic symptoms.   Physical Examination and Investigations: On inspection  there were notable changes in skin color and observable muscle atrophy in the left leg. The foot was mildly edematous with a necrotic ulcer on the plantar surface. Pulses were feeble  and ankle-brachial index was calculated as 0.5. Doppler ultrasound of the left leg showed significantly reduced blood flow through the arteries.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Risk factors contributing to his condition include advanced age  racial predisposition  long-standing diabetes  hypertension  and family history of vascular diseases.   Management and Plan: The patient was admitted for further management. The plan includes consultation with vascular surgery for possible revascularization interventions. Meanwhile  he is managed conservatively with strict glycemic control  optimized antihypertensive  lipid-lowering therapy  and analgesics for pain. An escalation in the treatment may be required based on vascular surgery's input and the patient’s response.  Prognosis: Despite high-risk factors  early detection and targeted intervention of CLI might reduce Mr. A's risk of limb loss. The case necessitates a multidisciplinary approach  involving cardiology  endocrinology  vascular surgery  and diabetic educators. This coincides with his overall status related to heart disease and diabetes management.  Educational Objective: This case underscores the importance of early recognition  effective management of chronic conditions  and the potential preventability of severe complications like CLI in at-risk populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,7,Patient Presentation  The patient  Mr. L  is a 68-year-old African-American male residing in an urban area. He presented with a complaint of severe resting pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the foot region. This symptom has persisted for about three months now and has been progressively worsening.  Past Medical History   Mr. L has a documented history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past decade. His blood sugar levels were poorly controlled  with his latest HbA1c reported at 9.5%. He was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years back and is on medication. His electronic medical records revealed a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 35 years  though he quit smoking five years ago. He also underwent an angioplasty for coronary artery disease 7 years ago.  Family History  His family history is significant with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at 72 and his mother having had type 2 diabetes. His older sibling is also hypertensive and the younger sibling recently got diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD)  therefore suggesting a genetic predisposition towards cardiovascular diseases.  Relevant Studies  On examination  there were missing pulses and coldness in his left foot. The color Doppler showed restricted arterial flow in his left lower limb  confirming critical limb ischemia. An Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) was done  and it came back as 0.4  considerably less than the normal range (1.0-1.4)  signaling PAD.   Given his significant risk factors  including the advanced age  African-American ethnicity  history of diabetes  hypertension  coronary artery disease  smoking  the male gender  and a strong familial predisposition to cardiovascular diseases  it fulfills the characteristic demographics and risk profile of his condition as found in the literature.   Management  Mr. L was scheduled for emergency revascularization. He was also referred to a diabetes educator and dietician for better management of his diabetes. A smoking cessation clinic was recommended in case he ever relapses. Recommended modifications in lifestyle include regular exercise and maintaining a balanced diet.  Prognosis   The prognosis remains guarded given the advanced disease state and the presence of multiple comorbid conditions. Improvement and maintenance of his condition also highly depend on his commitment towards recommended lifestyle changes and disease management strategies  particularly glycemic control. Regular follow-ups are advised for monitoring disease progression  therapeutic management  and to promptly address any potential complications. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,8,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old African American man  presented to the vascular surgery clinic with a two-month history of pain in the right calf that worsens while walking and is relieved by rest (intermittent claudication). He is a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years and has a history of hypertension for the past ten years. He is an ex-smoker  having quit five years ago. He lives with his wife in the city and is retired. Daily activities such as walking his dog have become increasingly challenging due to his leg pain.   Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at 65  and his mother had a stroke at 75. There is a notable history of cardiovascular disease in the family.  Clinical Examination:  Upon examination  his right lower limb was cold to touch below the knee with an absent posterior tibial pulse and diminished dorsalis pedis pulse. His Buerger’s test was positive with a pallor on elevation and rubor on dependency.   Investigations:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  which provided a ratio of 0.6 on the right and 0.9 on the left  confirming severe peripheral arterial disease of the right lower limb. Further tests such as the computed tomographic angiography (CTA) indicated severe stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. It also demonstrated insufficient collateral circulation in the leg  including the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.   Treatment:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia  the advanced stage of peripheral artery disease. He was successfully treated with an endovascular procedure  including balloon angioplasty and stenting of his femoral and popliteal artery. Instructions were given to optimize medical therapy for diabetes and hypertension  attend regular follow-ups  and involve in a structured program of supervised exercise. He was also prescribed antiplatelet therapy and statins.   Summary:  The case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt treatment of critical limb ischemia  particularly in high-risk populations like African-American ethnicity  older age  diabetes  hypertension  and history of smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,9,Patient Presentation   Name: Mr. James Wilson Age: 72 years old  Race: Caucasian Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Army Colonel  Chief Complaint: Chronic pain in the left lower limb  especially at night  and non-healing ulcers on the left foot.  Present Illness: Mr. Wilson  a former smoker  first noticed the pain two months ago. It came intermittently and was initially mild  but over the past two weeks  it intensified and became constant. He is also diabetic and hypertensive  with both conditions well-controlled with medications over the past ten years.   Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the left lower limb was pallid  cold to touch with weak pulses. There were painful non-healing ulcers present on his left foot. His ankle-brachial index(ABI) was 0.70  indicating a decreased blood flow to his lower extremities. His Blood glucose level was slightly elevated  and blood pressure was under control.  Diagnostic Assessment: He underwent a CT angiography  which revealed severe blockages in his left lower extremity's arteries. A diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made  worsening due to his past smoking behavior and poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus.  Treatment: He was admitted to a vascular medicine department and underwent angioplasty to restore blood flow. Post-procedure  he was maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy and statins. Glycaemic control was pursued.  Family History:  His mother had Type II diabetes  and his father had ischemic heart disease. He has two sons  both healthy.   This case depicts a typical patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). CLI is prevalent among Caucasian males  with a higher prevalence among those 70 years and older. Key risk factors include smoking  diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol  and having a family history of vascular diseases.    Learning Points:  - CLI is a common yet severe condition with potential severe complications if not addressed promptly. - Key risk factors are modifiable; thus  prevention is key in high-risk demographics.  - Comprehensive foot care in diabetic patients can help prevent the advancement to CLI. - Regular follow-up of diabetes and hypertension patients for peripheral vascular diseases is essential for early identification and treatment.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,10,Patient Presentation: Patient is Mr. Lorenzo  a 75-year-old African American retired bank manager  recently diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He lives in Miami  Florida with his wife and is a non-smoker. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away due to a stroke at the age of 82  and his mother had peripheral artery disease before she passed away at age 85.   Past Medical History: In his past medical history  Mr. Lorenzo was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and Type II diabetes 10 years ago. As part of medical management  he has been taking Amlodipine for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes. Five years ago Mr. Lorenzo suffered from a transient ischemic attack (TIA)  which was managed through medication and routine monitoring. Despite the efforts to control his blood pressure and blood sugar levels  his compliance with medications and lifestyle modification has been inconsistent.   Presenting Complaint: Over the last few months  Mr. Lorenzo has been experiencing severe leg pain especially on walking short distances which initially he thought was due to aging. He visited his healthcare provider when the pain started occurring even at rest and disrupting his sleep. There was also noticeable discoloration in his foot  specifically his toes appeared to be bluish-blackish.  Clinical Review: Mr. Lorenzo presented with the alarm symptoms such as rest pain  non-healing wounds on his foot  and discoloration of toes which raised concerns for CLI. He underwent angiography which confirmed the diagnosis of CLI. The angiogram showed significant blockage in the left lower limb arteries. Mr. Lorenzo’s Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) score was less than 0.4 which also indicated severe disease.  Management and Plan: Considering Mr. Lorenzo's age  comorbidities  and the severity of his CLI  he was advised for revascularization. A multi-disciplinary team involving a vascular surgeon  interventional radiologist  and cardiologist was formed for his care. Along with that  lifestyle modifications and strict control of his diabetes and hypertension were also stressed. A podiatrist was also involved in his care team for the management of his foot ulcers.   Understanding the risk factors in Mr. Lorenzo's case  early detection  and aggressive management of CLI has been initiated. The importance of strict compliance to medication and healthier lifestyle was also emphasized to the patient due to his past history of inconsistent adherence to medical advice.   Communication with Mr. Lorenzo's primary care physician was done to ensure continuity of care especially due to his multiple comorbidities. Genetic counseling was planned for Mr. Lorenzo's children considering the strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  diabetes  and hypertension.   This case sheds light on the importance of early recognition of CLI especially in high-risk patients with a history of diabetes and hypertension. It also emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary approach and patient education in the effective management of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,11,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. P  is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who presented himself at the clinic for evaluation of pain in his left leg. Mr. P is a manual laborer  married  with two adult children. He resides in suburban Michigan and engages in smoking and occasional alcohol consumption. He denies illicit drug use. There is a history of cardiovascular diseases in his paternal family line; his father suffered a stroke at age 69 and his grandfather passed from myocardial infarction at the age of 82.  Medical History:  Mr. P has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes for the past 15 years  and manages it through a combination of oral medication and dietary restrictions. He also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Moreover  he experiences bouts of intermittent claudication  which have progressively worsened over the last six months. The patient reports significant pain after walking for ten minutes and at rest; pain often negated through hanging his leg over the bed edge. He also mentioned his left foot becoming cold and pale  contrasting the normal warmth and coloration of his right foot. His past records disclose no known allergies  prior similar symptoms  surgeries  or serious accidents.   Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient's body mass index is 29 kg/m2. Blood pressure readings show 160/90 mmHg in the right arm and 158/88 mmHg in the left. His heart rate was noted as irregular at 80 beats per minute  with no heart murmurs detected. Pulses in his lower left leg were not palpable  and a Doppler ultrasound confirmed no audible Doppler signals in the left foot. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was 0.3 in the left leg and 1.2 in the right  indicative of peripheral artery disease.  Management Plan:  A diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease was established. The implications and possible consequences of this condition were explained in detail to the patient  highlighting the serious nature of the condition and the necessity for urgent attention. As per guidelines  a combination of medical  surgical  and lifestyle change interventions were offered.   An aggressive management plan was proposed  including antiplatelet therapy  lipid-lowering agents  antihypertensive drugs  adequate glycemic control  and smoking cessation measures. Mr. P has been referred for endovascular intervention to save his left limb  and in-house counseling was organized to assist him in managing his lifestyle changes for a sustainable future.   Prognosis:  Mr. P's compliance with the treatment plan and his adoptative changes to lifestyle habits will significantly dictate the disease progression. With his diagnosis  the successful management of CLI can avert potential limb amputation  reduce morbidity  and enhance overall survival and quality of life. Regular follow-up and continuous monitoring are crucial to regulate his health condition and nip any potential complications in the bud.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,12,Patient Case Presentation:   * Demographics:   Mr. X is a 67-year-old African American male  as studies indicate that critical limb ischemia tends to be more prevalent in individuals of African American descent over 50 years of age.   * Presenting Problem:  Mr. X has been experiencing severe pain in his right foot  particularly at rest  along with noticeable color changes and temperature difference compared to the left foot.   * Past Medical History:  Mr. X has an extensive history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia  both of which are major contributing factors to peripheral artery disease and  ultimately  critical limb ischemia. He was also a heavy smoker in his youth  which adds to his vascular risk profile.   * Family History:  His father had an early heart attack at the age of 50  and his elder brother has peripheral artery disease  suggesting a familial predisposition to atherosclerotic diseases.   * Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  his right foot is pale  cold  with several non-healing ulcers on the toes  and a weak pulse is palpable in the right pedal region. His right foot's Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is less than 0.4  confirming severe arterial insufficiency.  * Imaging:  An angiogram confirms a multi-segment disease with significant stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery  popliteal artery  and tibial vessels.   * Treatment:  Given Mr. X’s severe uncontrolled diabetes and critical limb ischemia with tissue damage  it is recommended that he immediately start intensive glycemic control. The plan includes medical management with antiplatelet  lipid-lowering agents  cilostazol for leg pain  and pain management with additional analgesics. Wound care with debridement of nonviable tissues is also initiated. The team is discussing a revascularization procedure to restore blood flow to the foot in order to prevent further tissue damage and possible amputation.   This case highlights the strong association between diabetes  smoking and critical limb ischemia  stressing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of risk factors  along with the aggressive management of established arterial disease to prevent severe outcomes such as loss of limb or life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,13,Patient's Case Presentation:  Patient's Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago. He is a current smoker with a 20-pack year history  and his family history is notable for his father having a Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and dying of cardiovascular disease. The patient  a retired construction worker  resides with his wife in a suburban setting.  Presenting Problem: The patient initially presented with severe pain in his left lower extremity  more marked on his toes  at rest that he graded as 8 on a zero to 10 pain rating scale. The pain was increasingly disturbing his sleep. He also noticed that his left foot became discolored  leaning towards pale and later turning blueish. He recalled slow-healing foot ulcer that had been worsening over the last 3 months  despite treating it with over-the-counter medications. He also reported an unexplained weight loss and fatigue.  Physical Examination and Laboratory Findings: On examination  his blood Pressure was 150/90 mmHg; BMI was 28 (overweight). His left foot was cool to touch compared to the right foot  with a noticeable wound on the forefoot. His foot pulses were barely palpable. The ankle-brachial index was 0.4 on the left  confirming severe ischemia.  An angiography showed multiple blockages in the arteries supplying the left lower extremity. His HbA1c was found to be 9 indicating poor glycemic control over the past few months. This history  along with the clinical picture  guided the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Management: After reviewing the options and associated risks  he agreed to the proposed endovascular revascularization. He was also intensively counseled on strict glycemic control  adherence to antihypertensive medicines  smoking cessation  maintaining a healthy diet  and exercising to promote circulation and weight reduction.   Therefore  while the patient's ethnicity (African American) and family history of PAD increased his predisposition to this condition  his smoking history  poorly controlled Diabetes and Hypertension have likely been major contributors to the development of the advanced PAD now manifesting as CLI. The case also reflects the reality of CLI presenting itself beyond just pain and drawing attention to the necessity of patient awareness  early detection  and lifestyle modifications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,14,Patient Profile Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Factory Worker Smoking Status: Heavy smoker (45 pack years) Alcohol Consumption: Moderate (1-2 drinks per day)  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe presents with severe and unrelenting pain in his right lower extremity  even during rest. He reports that this has been coupled with non-healing sores on his foot for the past three weeks  which have recently been showing signs of gangrene.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and dyslipidemia. He has a history of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption. He underwent coronary bypass surgery 5 years ago. He has not been consistent with his medication.  Family History: He has a family history of peripheral artery disease  with his father being diagnosed at age 62. His mother had a history of stroke and died at the age of 70. His elder brother died of myocardial infarction at age 59.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the right foot appeared to be dusky and cold with a palpable but weak pedal pulse. A non-healing ulcer was noted on his right big toe with signs of dry gangrene. No meaningful dorsalis pedis pulse was felt.  Investigations: Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) indicates a value of 0.40 in the right leg  indicating severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Doppler ultrasound imaging of the right lower limb revealed substantial stenosis in the popliteal and tibial arteries.  Diagnosis: Given Mr. Doe's history  physical examination  and diagnostic investigations  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made.  Management: Immediate referral to a vascular surgeon was made for consideration of angioplasty or surgical revascularization. Mr. Doe was started on antiplatelet therapy and statin. Blood glucose and blood pressure control management were intensified. His wound was cleaned and dressed professionally  and antibiotics were administered to tackle potential infection. Smoking cessation and moderation in alcohol consumption were strongly advised.  Prognosis: The prognosis for Mr. Doe depends on his ability to establish care with a vascular surgeon promptly  his success in managing concurrent conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  and adherence to a healthier lifestyle  including smoking cessation. Without immediate and proper intervention  Mr. Doe's condition may lead to amputation of the affected limb and can have detrimental effects on his overall quality of life.   This case presentation outlines a common scenario for a patient with critical limb ischemia  a significant health concern for older adults with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension  and a history of smoking. The key aspects to successful management include early detection  timely intervention  and continued management of the patient's overall health and lifestyle.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,15,Patient Case Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics: Mr. Robertson  a 63-year-old African American male. He resides in the suburbs of Chicago  Illinois  and works as a long-haul truck driver. He is a divorcee and lives alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. Robertson has Type II Diabetes and hypertension managed with Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. He also has a 45-year history of smoking  currently smokes about 10 cigarettes a day  and struggles with alcoholism  although he has been sober for six years.   Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Robertson visited the clinic with the persistent complaint of pain in his right lower extremity. The pain is exacerbated by doing simple chores  including walking across his apartment  and has caused sleep disturbances due to nocturnal discomfort. Recently  he experienced a non-healing wound on his right big toe.   Physical examination: On examination  he had a diminished pulse in the right femoral  popliteal  and dorsalis pedis arteries. He displayed signs of critical limb ischemia including pallor  coolness in his right foot  livedo reticularis  and dependent rubor. The right big toe had a 2x2 cm non-healing ulcer.  Investigations: Peripheral arterial disease was suspected  confirmed by doppler ultrasound that demonstrated substantially reduced ankle-brachial index. Further angiography revealed severe stenosis in his right femoral artery.  Family History: His father suffered from coronary artery disease and passed away following a heart attack at the age of 70. His mother died at 93  with a history of stroke in her late 80s. He's the oldest of three siblings; his younger brother has Type II Diabetes  whereas his sister is a breast cancer survivor.  Plan: The vascular surgery team recommended femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass using a saphenous vein graft  combined with more aggressive medical management control for his diabetes and hypertension. He was also advised to quit smoking and to enter a smoking cessation program. Additionally  a wound care consult was obtained for local wound care instructions.  Prognosis: The prognosis of patients with critical limb ischemia is poor due to underlying comorbidities like diabetes  smoking  and hypertension. Despite intervention  the risk of amputation or death within a year is high without aggressive and robust medical management.  Mr. Robertson's case highlights the epidemiology of critical limb ischemia  given his African American descent and male gender  which are both associated with higher rates of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). His past medical history and lifestyle factors -- including smoking  diabetes  and hypertension -- are among the most common risk factors for PAD. The patient's experiences of claudication and rest pain point to advanced PAD  leading to critical limb ischemia. This case underscores the significance of early detection  lifestyle modification  and vigilant management of comorbidities in these patients. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,16,Case Presentation  Demographics: Mr. Smith  a 78-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint:  Increasing left lower extremity (LLE) discolouration and rest pain for over one month  and non-healing wound just above the left ankle for two weeks.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history of diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years. He is also hypertensive and was diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) five years prior. He reports struggles with smoking cessation and maintains a 40-pack year history.  Examination: The patient has noticeable pain in his LLE  which is exacerbated by elevation and slightly relieved by dependency. The skin is pallid with mottled discoloration and a non-healing ulcer above the left ankle. Peripheral pulses are absent upon palpation  and capillary refill is prolonged.  Investigations: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurement of less than 0.4 confirms critical limb ischemia. Arterial duplex study shows high-grade stenosis of left popliteal and posterior tibial arteries.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's father had a lower limb amputation due to unknown vascular complications. His mother lived with uncontrolled diabetes and eventually died from complications post-myocardial infarction.  Treatment: After a multidisciplinary consultation with Vascular Surgery  Interventional Radiology  and Podiatry teams  an endovascular revascularization intervention is recommended. Post-operatively  Mr. Smith is set to engage in aggressive wound care and optimization of risk factors including better glycemic control and smoking cessation.  Discussion: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a case of concomitant diabetes and peripheral arterial disease represents poor prognosis due to impaired wound healing and heightened risk for lower limb amputation. Mr. Smith's obesity and smoking habit propagate risk. This case is indicative of literature showing the high prevalence of CLI in male  elderly  diabetic  hypertensive  and smoking populations. Family history corroborates susceptibility. Identifying CLI early and providing swift intervention may significantly improve outcomes.  Learning Points: - CLI often presents in elderly patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease  particularly peripheral arterial disease. - Swift diagnosis is central to prevent limb loss  using ABI as a cost-effective diagnostic tool. - First-line treatment centers on revascularization for perfusion restoration alongside wound care and management of comorbid conditions. - Lifestyle modifications and risk factor optimization are imperative for long-term management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,17,Patient Information: Mr. Williams  a 68-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: Severe and recurring pain on the left foot even while resting.  Past Medical History: Mr. Williams recently had a diabetes mellitus type 2 diagnosis and hypertension that has been progressively uncontrolled over the last five years despite medication. He's a retired construction worker with a multi-decade smoking history. A history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) can be noted from the records dated two years back.  Family History: His mother suffered from type 2 diabetes  and his father had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease later in his life.  Social History: Mr. Williams quit smoking about a year ago. He lives with his wife  has three adult children  and doesn’t consume alcohol.  Physical Examination: On inspection  the left foot appeared pale with visible skin alterations  such as thin and shiny skin. Peripheral pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery) on the left side were absent. His Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) values of the left foot showed a low result (<0.40).  Pain assessment: The patient reported intermittent claudication for over a year  which has now escalated to consistent pain at rest  mostly during the nighttime.  Investigations: Doppler Ultrasound suggested decreased blood flow to the patient's left lower extremity  which indicates severe ischemia. ABI values further confirmed these findings. His blood glucose levels were high  hemoglobin A1c was 7.5%  and lipid panel showed increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical representation and investigations  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to the peripheral artery disease due to uncontrolled diabetes and prolonged history of smoking.  Treatment Plan: Considering Mr. Williams' history of type 2 diabetes and the progression of CLI  a multidimensional approach was planned involving a team of vascular surgeons  endocrinologists  dieticians  and physiotherapists. The primary management goal is to relieve pain  help in ulcer healing  prevent limb loss  and improve quality of life. Pharmacological management includes antiplatelets/ anticoagulants  statins  and ACE inhibitors. As a long-term  healthier lifestyle is highly encouraged for the patient  advocating a well-balanced diet and regular exercise.  Follow-up and Prognosis: Extended follow-ups are scheduled to monitor the progression of the disease and to make appropriate modifications to the treatment as and when necessary. Prognosis of CLI is moderate to poor given the nature of the disease and relying considerably on lifestyle modifications. Counselling was offered to help the patient understand this and to comply with the suggested lifestyle changes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,18,Patient Case Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Demographics: The patient is a 64-year-old African American male who is retired. He lives with his wife in a semi-rural area. In America  CLI prevalence is higher among African Americans and those aged above 50.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of chronic conditions including high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes  both of which have been managed with medication for the last eight years. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago after 25 years of one pack a day smoking. He also has a long-standing history of dyslipidemia and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  a common comorbidity in CLI patients. His BMI is 27  putting him in the overweight category.  Presentation: The patient presents with a six-month history of persistent pain in his right leg  primarily at rest. There is also a non-healing ulcer on the right heel. These symptoms escalated over the past week  making sleep difficult and causing extreme discomfort with any movement. This paints a picture of CLI.  Family History: There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease on the patient's paternal side - both his father and elder brother passed away from myocardial infarctions in their late sixties. His mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes later in life.  Recent Lab Tests: His most recent HbA1c level was 8.2%  indicating that his diabetes is not well controlled. The lipid profile shows elevated LDL and low HDL levels. The Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)  a diagnostic tool for PAD  scored at 0.4 (normal range: 0.9-1.3)  indicating severe blockage and poor blood flow.   Imaging: A contrast angiogram revealed significant blockages in the below-knee arteries. Poorly visualized foot arteries suggest severe ischemia  consistent with CLI diagnosis.  Plan: The interventional radiologist recommends endovascular intervention including balloon angioplasty and stenting  considering the patient's extensive disease in below-knee arteries. A consultation was sought with a vascular surgeon keeping in mind possible bypass surgery. The patient was also advised to consult with the diabetes team to optimize glycemic control  besides discussing a diet plan with a nutritionist and starting a more aggressive statin therapy for dyslipidemia. The patient was highly encouraged to engage in a supervised exercise program after recovery from interventions.  This case presentation reflects the comprehensive approach needed for CLI patients with multiple comorbidities  requiring multidisciplinary input from various specialists such as interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  diabetes specialist  dietitian  and a physical therapist.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,19,Patient Profile:   Mr. John Smith is a 68-year-old African-American male  retired Army veteran  living in Houston  Texas. He is married with four grown-up children. Racial/ethnic predisposition is particularly significant since African-Americans have been found to have a relatively higher susceptibility to peripheral artery disease (PAD)  which predisposes individuals to critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago. He has been managing all three conditions through regular medication and diet modification  which is common in CLI patients. He is also an ex-smoker  having quit around ten years ago  which is noteworthy considering smoking is a significant risk factor for CLI. He had a right nephrectomy done about seven years ago due to renal carcinoma.   Family History:  The patient's family history reveals that his father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother  at 75  from stroke; cardiovascular diseases are prevalent in his family history  contributing to his risk profile. Both his older brother and sister have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension.   Presenting Complaint:   Mr. Smith has been suffering from intermittent severe pain in his left lower extremity  particularly the foot. The pain intensifies when he walks and alleviates when he rests  indicative of claudication. Additionally  his left foot feels persistently cold  and the skin seems pale.   Physical Assessment:   On inspection  the left lower limb showed shiny skin with loss of hair. Pedal pulses in the left leg were feeble as compared to the right leg. An ulcer was also noted on the left heel  which he said had been present for the last six weeks. His BMI was recorded as 30.2  indicative of obesity.   Medical Management:   Mr. Smith was referred to a vascular surgeon for further assessment and management considering his symptoms indicative of CLI. He was started on anticoagulant therapy and statins besides his regular antihypertensives and antidiabetic medication. His ulcer was dressed and cleaned by the nursing team  and he was started on antibiotic therapy to prevent any possible infection.   Informed by current literature on critical limb ischemia  there is a high correlation in the case of Mr. Smith between his demographic group and lifestyle choices  his comorbidity  and his diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. The compilation of relevant health histories  demographics  and presenting symptoms offers an example of accurate representation in relation to the literature and profiling of Mr. John Smith's case. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,20,Patient Presentation:   Mr. A is a 63-year-old African American male  recently diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient has a past medical history significant for tobacco use (smoked one pack a day for over 30 years)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes  which has been poorly controlled over the past decade. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years ago. He has not been compliant with his prescribed medications due to his lack of health insurance coverage.  Demographics Information:  Given that Mr. A fits the higher risk demographic for CLI  being an aged male  a smoker  diabetic and hypertensive. African Americans are known to be at high risk for developing peripheral artery disease and subsequently critical limb ischemia  due in part to the high incidence of diabetes and hypertension in this population.  Family History:  Mr. A reported a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father dying of a myocardial infarction at age 60 and his older brother getting diagnosed with ischemic heart disease at age 55. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease or CLI.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. A presented to the clinic with complaints of severe pain in the left lower leg and foot even at rest. He also reported non-healing ulcers in the same region and significant weight loss over the last few months due to discomfort and difficulty walking. He had reduced sensation in his left foot  and upon examination  there were noticeable color changes  suggesting poor circulation.  Additional Information:  It is worthy to mention and investigate whether Mr. A has any psychosocial issues like depression due to the hardship of dealing with a debilitating condition like CLI. Psychological stresses can complicate the management of his diabetes and hypertension.  Diagnosis:  With his given symptoms  history  and physical examination  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made  a condition that is often triggered by a complication of peripheral artery disease. This was confirmed by conducting an angiogram which showed severe blockages in the arteries of his left lower extremity.  Treatment Plan:  The patient was recommended for an urgent revascularization procedure to restore blood flow to the limb. Long-term  Mr. A would need to adhere to an intensive combined approach with lifestyle changes  including smoking cessation  strict control of his diabetes and hypertension  regular problem-focused foot inspection  appropriate foot care  and timely podiatry review. Consideration of social work involvement was also suggested to help the patient employ the necessary resources and regain compliance to his medication regimen. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,21,Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. A  Age: 65 Years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired electrician  Presenting Concern: Mr. A came to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his right leg at rest. He also reported non-healing sores on his right foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a history of hypertension and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years ago. He is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 30-year pack history. He has also been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been under control through lifestyle modifications and oral hypoglycemic agents.  Family History: Mr. A's father died of stroke at the age of 70  and his mother has well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease or critical limb ischemia.  Clinical Examination: On examination  Mr. A's right foot was found to be pale with diminished hair growth and decreased temperature compared to the left foot. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were significantly decreased. There were non-healing sores on the dorsal aspect of the foot.  Investigations: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed  which demonstrated a level below 0.40 in the affected leg. Doppler ultrasound reported significant stenosis in the right distal superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  clinical examination  and investigations  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Treatment: The patient was started on conservative management  (including antiplatelet therapy  statins  and optimal diabetes control)  pain management  and referred to vascular surgery for possible percutaneous angioplasty or bypass surgery.  Prognosis: Given his age  controlled diabetes  and former smoker status  Mr. A has a fair prognosis of treatment success. However  it's crucial to monitor for any nonhealing wounds or infection. A multi-interdisciplinary approach such as diet  exercise  medication  and periodic surveillance will be beneficial in overall long-term health maintenance.  This patient presentation attempts to accurately reflect demographic information typically encountered with this condition. Both advancing age and smoking are common risk factors for critical limb ischemia  and the prevalence is higher among males and Caucasians. Furthermore  a history of hypertension  diabetes  and peripheral artery disease significantly increases the risk of developing CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,22,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 75-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  primarily to his right lower extremity. His address is registered to be within a low socioeconomic area of South Los Angeles. His presenting symptom was chronic pain in his right lower leg  especially upon exertion and even at rest  which improves upon elevation. The pain is often described as dull and cramping. Mr. Rodriguez also reports skin changes to his lower limb and slow healing sores on his feet  aligning with the usual symptoms of CLI.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Rodriguez has a significant past medical history  with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes for the past 15 years  which is comorbid with peripheral artery disease (PAD) he has been managing for the past 5 years. He also has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years  but quit ten years ago. Further  he has a history of a myocardial infarction that happened six years ago. However  he has no records of any past surgeries or allergies.   Family History:   His father passed away due to a stroke  and his mother suffered from hypertension. One of his two brothers has diabetes  and the other brother was diagnosed with heart disease at the age of 60.   Current Medication:   His medications include metformin for diabetes  aspirin to help prevent heart attacks  and a statin to control his cholesterol. Despite his disease-oriented medications  his condition has continued to worsen  probably due to his predilection based on race  socioeconomic status  and personal habits including the long term smoking.  Physical Examination:   Upon physical examination  Mr. Rodriguez's vitals were stable  but his right lower extremity was cooler to touch compared to the left  with absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. He also displayed pallor when the leg was elevated and hyperemia when dependent. Furthermore  the presence of non-healing ulcers on his right foot along with atrophic skin changes was observed.  Clinical Outcome:   Currently  Mr. Rodriguez is facing a high risk of limb loss considering the association between CLI  diabetes  and PAD. Intervention should be sought immediately to prevent amputation  which includes revascularization therapies in combination with strict diabetes and blood pressure management. The patient should be educated about potential outcomes  lifestyle modifications and the management plan should be discussed.  This brief case presentation is a representation of the common demographic that suffers from CLI  specifically an elderly  Hispanic male  with long-term smoking and diabetes history. CLI is quite prevalent among the Hispanic population due to the higher prevalence of diabetes  especially in lower socioeconomic areas where access to healthcare might be compromised.

He is a retired truck driver  lives with his wife  and they have four adult children.  Past Medical History:  John has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed twenty years ago  which is poorly controlled despite medication and diet. He has hypertension being managed with medication for the past ten years and also suffers from hyperlipidemia. He had an acute myocardial infarction five years ago which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. He is currently on Aspirin  Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin.  History of Present Illness:  He had been experiencing pain in his left lower limb when walking  which had progressively worsened  and he had noticed the formation of non-healing wounds on his left foot over the past month.  Family History: Both his parents suffered from cardiovascular disease  with his father dying from a heart attack at the age of 71  and his mother suffering from stroke at 76.  Social History:  He has been a heavy smoker for over 40 years. He drinks alcohol occasionally and does not engage in regular exercise due to his professional background.  Examination: On examination  there was noticeable pallor  coldness  and cyanosis in his left foot. Peripheral pulses were diminished in his left leg  and capillary refill was significantly delayed. His left foot showed multiple non-healing sores on the sole.  Based on his presentation  history  and physical exam  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made.  Management Plan: The management plan will focus on addressing his severe arterial disease that has led to critical limb ischemia. John will require vascular imaging and possibly revascularization procedures. His current medication regimen will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.  In addition to this  lifestyle changes  including quitting smoking and following a supervised exercise program will be recommended to enhance his quality of life. Regular foot examination and adequate wound care will need to be done. He will be referred to a diabetic educator for better blood glucose control and a dietitian for dietary management. Aggressive management of his cardiovascular risk factors  including lipid control  is required.  Discussion: Critical limb ischemia in John's case could be attributed to multiple risk factors  including long-term smoking  poorly controlled diabetes  and pre-existing heart disease. Consideration of all these factors is essential in managing this patient's condition and preventing further deterioration. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the outcome and quality of life for patients like John with CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,24,Patient Profile: Mr. Jackson  a 68-year-old African-American male  was referred to our outpatient clinic with a primary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mr. Jackson lives with his wife in an urban community.  Medical History: The patient has a significant history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II for the past 20 years  hypertension for 15 years  and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Due to his renal condition  he has been attending weekly hemodialysis sessions. He is also a former smoker  having quit ten years ago  but had a 30 pack-year history before quitting.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Jackson presented with severe rest pain in his right calf  which had been worsening over the past month. The pain was unrelieved with medication  making it difficult for him to walk or sleep. Upon physical examination  the right foot was observed to be pale with an absence of pedal pulses and ulcerations on the toes. His body mass index was calculated at 28.  Family History: Mr. Jackson's family history is significant with his father having suffered from a stroke in his 70s and eventually passing away due to cardiovascular complications. His mother had Type 2 diabetes and died in her late 60s of renal failure.  Lab Results and Imaging: The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) result was less than 0.4 in both feet  consistent with CLI. An angiogram showed complete blockage of blood flow in his right common femoral artery. Blood tests also revealed uncontrolled blood glucose levels and high cholesterol.  Management: Mr. Jackson is currently on Metformin for his diabetes  and Lisinopril for his hypertension. The vascular surgery team suggested a below-knee amputation considering the severity of ischemia  but Mr. Jackson wished to continue medical therapy and avoid amputation. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted for better management  involving a podiatrist to deal with wound care  a dietitian to help control blood glucose levels  and a physiotherapist for walking aid.  Discussion: Mr. Jackson represents the typical demographic of CLI patients: older  African American  with several cardiovascular comorbidities  including diabetes  renal disease  and hypertension. African-Americans are significantly more likely to develop CLI  and it generally affects more men than women  especially those with diabetes and renal disease. Delayed presentation and progression of CLI in patients like Mr. Jackson highlights the need for early detection and better management plans  especially for high-risk populations.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,25,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 73-year-old African-American male with a long-standing history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient is married and living with his wife in urban New York. He is a retired construction worker and has been a smoker for about fifty years  with approximately 20 cigarettes per day. He drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no known drug allergies.  Medical and Family History:  The patient has a known medical history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and has been treated for this in the past. Over the last few years  he has suffered from intermittent claudication. Seven years ago  the patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is well-controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications. He was diagnosed with hypertension about ten years ago and is taking medication (lisinopril) for it.   Patient's family history includes his father having suffered a heart attack at the age of 65  and both his parents had hypertension. His elder brother died from kidney disease complications related to diabetes  and his younger sister has obesity and heart disease.  Presenting Complaints:  Over the past week  the patient has experienced increasing pain in his left lower limb  more notably below the knee  progressing towards his foot. The pain is severe  continuous  and becomes worse during sleep. His wife noticed a discoloration (bluish-black) on his foot yesterday. He is unable to walk due to the intense pain.   Physical and Diagnostic Evaluation:  Upon physical examination  the lower limb was cold to touch with feeble popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses. The patient’s ankle-brachial index (ABI) was critically low  and Doppler ultrasound showed severely compromised blood flow to the left lower limb. Further diagnostic angiography showed multiple occlusions in the distal arteries. The findings  along with his smoking history and signs of rest pain and gangrene  point towards a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Proposed Management:  The management plan involves immediate referral to a vascular surgeon for consultation and considering revascularization options  either endovascular or bypass surgery  to restore limb perfusion. Parallelly  optimizing his diabetes and hypertension control and total smoking cessation is necessary. He may require pain management and psychiatric support for an abrupt lifestyle change. Family members should be included in the discussion to ensure the patient's compliance with lifestyle modifications.  This case encapsulates the typical demographic representation of a CLI patient - older  African-American  male  diabetic  hypertensive  with a history of PAD  and a smoking habit  as found in literature. It highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach in managing such cases to preserve limb function and patient's quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,26,Patient Case:   Patient is a 63-year-old African American male by the name of Mr. J. residing in the Southeastern part of the United States. Mr. J is a former construction worker  recently retired  married  and a father to three adult children. He is also a veteran with a history of smoking about one pack every day for over 40 years. Over the years  he developed Type II diabetes and hypertension  which have been managed with oral medications prescribed by the primary healthcare provider.   Mr. J presented to the hospital with a non-healing ulcer on his left lower extremity that had been present for the past three months. He admitted to having intermittent claudication after walking short distances and rest pain  characterized by a severe burning pain in his foot  especially at night. On physical examination  his left leg appeared to be pale with delayed capillary refill  loss of hair  absent dorsal pedis and posterior tibial pulses  and the foot felt cold to touch. The ulcer was about 3 cm in diameter  located on the lateral aspect of his lower leg with evidence of gangrene on the fifth toe. His systolic blood pressure was high at 150/90 mmHg  random blood sugar level - 210mg/dL  Hemoglobin A1c - 7.6%  lipid profile and EKG were abnormal. His Body Mass Index was 29 indicating overweight.   There was no history of any autoimmune disease or trauma  and he had a known allergy to Penicillin. His father had a history of experiencing a myocardial infarction at the age of 55  whereas his mother was a Type II diabetic. He mentioned that his eldest brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) at the age of 60.  Given the triad of rest pain  non-healing wounds  and signs of tissue loss  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  an advanced stage of PAD was made. CLI is often associated with diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking  all of which were present in Mr. J's case. The demographic factors including African American race  age over 60  male gender  the southeastern geographic region  and a veteran status have also been associated with a higher prevalence of CLI  as per relevant literature. The vascular surgeon was alerted about the case and further investigations were planned to confirm the diagnosis and plan the treatment.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,27,Patient Presentation:  Patient X is a 75-year-old African American male  retired truck driver  from Augusta  Georgia  brought in by his daughter after complaining of chronic pain in his lower left limb  particularly in his foot and calf muscle. Notably  the patient also mentioned he experienced pain in the same location while resting  which often woke him up at night. He reports the pain scale to be around 6-7 on a scale of 1 to 10.   Medical History:  He has a past medical history significant for type II diabetes mellitus  diagnosed twenty years prior  which has been relatively controlled until recent months. He also has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was a smoker but quit five years ago  having smoked around 20 cigarettes per day for 40 years. He also underwent angioplasty twelve years ago due to coronary artery disease.  Family History:  The patient's father died at the age 67 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother  currently aged 92  has a history of hypertension. He has two siblings – an older brother who is diagnosed with diabetes  and a younger sister suffering from hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Physical Exam:  On physical examination  the left lower extremity appeared pale with loss of hair  particularly on the foot. The leg was noticeably cooler compared to the contralateral leg. There were no palpable pulses in the foot and minimal dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. The ankle-brachial index was 0.3 on the left side.  Diagnostic and Lab Results:  Lab results revealed poorly controlled diabetes  with a HbA1c of 9.2%. Other significant values included LDL cholesterol of 180 mg/dL and triglycerides of 200 mg/dl.   Conclusion:  Based on the risk factors including his uncontrolled diabetes  smoking history  hyperlipidemia  family history of cardiovascular disease  and the physical examination findings  the patient was diagnosed as a case of 'critical limb ischemia'. He was further investigated and referred for vascular imaging and potential revascularization. The patient and his family were educated about the disease's potential complications and the importance of strict glycemic control  diet modification  and regular follow-up.  This case highlights the importance of keeping a high level of suspicion for peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia  particularly among African American male patients with long-standing diabetes and a known history of cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,28,Patient Presentation:  This case presentation concerns a 72-year-old African American male patient named Mr. Allen  diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He was brought by his daughter to the clinic following complaints about severe rest pain in his right lower extremity  particularly the foot.  Patient Background:  Mr. Allen  a retired mechanic living in Detroit  has been a smoker for about 50 years  smoking two packs a day. His BMI is 31.8  indicating Obesity Class 1. His past medical history is significant. He has suffered from type II diabetes for the last 23 years  which has been poorly controlled. He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 52. He also suffers from hyperlipidemia and had a minor stroke 3 years ago  from which he made a full recovery.  Family History:  Mr. Allen's family history reveals that his father died at the age of 59 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother had a long history of type II diabetes and hypertension before she passed away. Mr. Allen has two siblings; his older brother passed away from a stroke  and his sister is alive and well.  Clinical Evaluation and Diagnosis:  On clinical examination  his right foot was cold to touch; pedal pulses were not palpable  and his foot showed signs of dry gangrene. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was taken  and it was less than 0.4. The significant clinical evaluation that led to the diagnosis of CLI was peripheral arterial Doppler ultrasound  which revealed severe stenoses in the superficial femoral and the popliteal arteries.  Discussion:  Mr. Allen represents an unfortunately common scenario amongst elderly African American men with poorly controlled diabetes and smoking history. According to literature  African American males have a higher incidence of CLI  often with a more severe presentation  partly due to modifiable risk factors such as smoking  obesity  and diabetes.  Management:  The management plan involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes a vascular surgeon  interventional cardiologist  endocrinologist  dietician  and a physiotherapist. The initial step will be to stabilize his condition and manage his pain through medication  followed by revascularization procedures to restore blood flow to his limb. His diabetes and hypertension need tight control  and his diet will need to be modified to adjust cholesterol intake and manage his obesity. Smoking cessation must be strongly emphasized.   These measures will help in healing his current ischemic foot and attempt to prevent progression to other limbs given his multiple risk factors. Additionally  attention will be given to psychological support and patient education to prevent similar episodes in the future.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,29,"Patient: Mr. J  67-year-old African American male  Presenting Problem: The patient presented severe leg pain  even at rest  with non-healing wounds on his right foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  uncontrolled for 20 years. He also has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Family History: The patient reported both his father and grandfather had diabetes  and his father also suffered from peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Social History: Mr. J has been a heavy smoker  smoking on average one pack per day for the past 35 years. He has worked as an electrician and admitted to drinking alcohol occasionally.   Vital Signs on Admission: BP: 145/90 mmHg  HR: 87 bpm  Temp: 98.6°F  RR: 18 breaths/minute  BMI: 33 kg/m2.  Physical Examination: Visible skin color changes on his right foot along with palpable coldness. Pedal pulses were absent. There were non-healing ulcers present on his right foot  the largest being approximately 1"""" in diameter  with exposed bone and signs of early gangrene.  Laboratory Findings: HbA1c levels were high at 9%. Fasting blood glucose ranged between 220-240 mg/dl. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL levels at 160 mg/dl.   Imaging: Angiography revealed severe obstructions in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries  consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Diagnosis: With the combination of claudication  non-healing ulcers  pain at rest  absence of pedal pulses  and angiogram results  Mr. J has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of PAD.  Plan: The interventional team recommended revascularization via bypass surgery to restore blood flow. Mr. J was started on antiplatelet therapy and statins after the surgery. He also received intensive wound management. The patient was advised to stop smoking  reduce alcohol intake  and was referred to dietary services for management of his diabetes and weight loss.  Follow-up: The patient would require close monitoring to assess the success of the bypass surgery and manage his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Emphasis was placed on lifestyle modifications and adherence to medication to prevent disease progression.  Note: Demographic data for this case presentation is consistent with CDC and American Heart Association statistics  which indicate higher prevalence of PAD and CLI among African Americans  elder males  and individuals with history of diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. CLI often presents with pain at rest and non-healing wounds or ulcers  and angiography is a common tool for diagnosis of arterial blockages. Treatment typically involves both surgery to restore blood flow and approaches to manage underlying risk factors."
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,30,Patient Profile:  Mr. Abrams is an 82-year-old African American male residing in rural North Carolina. He is a widowed retired coal miner who lives alone but near his two children. He remains socially active within his community and occasionally indulges in smoking cigars on special occasions. He has a BMI of 29.7  indicating that he is in the overweight category.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Abrams suffers from hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus which he has been managing for the past 20 years. He had a heart attack about 5 years ago  but the timely intervention and subsequent lifestyle changes have since then managed to keep his heart conditions stable. He has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed 7 years ago  for which he has been receiving treatment.  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Abrams reports severe rest pain in his right lower limb  particularly in the calf region  that has worsened over the past three weeks. He has noted ulcerations on his right foot that haven’t shown signs of healing alongside worsening intermittent claudication. He also mentioned experiencing pain even at rest affecting the quality of his sleep.   Family History:  Mr. Abrams has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His late father had a stroke in his 80s  and his elder sister  aged 79  currently has unstable angina. There is no known genetic disorder running in the family.  Diagnosis:  Based on his symptoms and significant history  Mr. Abrams was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries reducing blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.   Management and Follow-Ups:  Mr. Abrams' current medication for his existing conditions was reviewed. Appropriate plans were made for rigorous blood glucose control with insulin administration given the implication of poor wound healing in diabetics. He was started on pharmacological therapy for CLI with cilostazol and clopidogrel  to decrease his pain and improve his walking distance. Based on severity  the consideration of revascularization through angioplasty or bypass surgery will be kept open in subsequent follow-ups. Lifestyle modifications  smoking cessation  and regular supervised exercise were informed in detail to Mr. Abrams  which might help in relieving his symptoms and preventing further progression.  Prognosis:  With stringent control of risk factors  adherence to lifestyle modification  and timely surgical intervention if required  Mr. Abrams' quality of life can be significantly improved  and his limb may be salvaged. It is pivotal to ensure regular follow-up scheduling given the progressive nature of CLI  the severe implications of noncompliance  and the associated risk of amputation.   Mr. Abrams represents the high-risk population for CLI  as literature identifies older  diabetic  and African American individuals with a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) at elevated risk for this disease. Hence  his case emphasizes the importance of preventative care  regular follow-ups  and comprehensive management in similar patient demographics.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,31,Patient Profile:   Mr. H.  a 70-year-old African American male  has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a retired corporate executive and lives with his wife in a suburban setting. He is a long-time smoker and has a history of chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are common risk factors for CLI. Mr. H. now presents to the clinic complaining of severe pain in his left lower limb even at rest. He also discusses a non-healing wound on his left foot.  Medical History:  Mr. H.’s past medical history includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 15 years ago)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on Metformin for the diabetes  along with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin for the hypertension and high cholesterol  respectively. In addition  he has a 50-year history of smoking but stopped consumption three years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History:  A comprehensive family history reveals that both his parents and older brother had cardiovascular diseases. His father had a stroke at the age of 68  his mother had coronary artery disease  and his brother died at the age of 60 due to a myocardial infarction. This history of cardiovascular disease in his family points towards a possible genetic predisposition to developing vascular conditions.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination showed an absent pulse in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries of the left foot. A non-healing wound  approximately 3 cm in diameter  was also noted on the left foot's plantar aspect along with discoloration and a cool temperature. No murmurs  rubs  or gallops were audible on cardiac examination.  Laboratory Examination:  Lipid profile showed high serum LDL cholesterol level. Hb1AC level was 9% indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Complete blood count  serum creatinine  and electrolytes were within normal range. Doppler ultrasound confirmed reduced blood flow to the left lower limb.  Diagnosis:   The presenting complaint  significant past medical history  physical description  and vascular study led to the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia  which was likely caused by Mr. H's history of smoking  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes.   Treatment Plan:   Considering his diagnosis  the provider proposed an aggressive treatment option that involves lower extremity angioplasty to improve blood flow and a strict regimen to better control his risk factors. Smoking cessation is reinforced  along with aggressive management of his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Topical wound management is initiated to promote wound healing in his left foot.   Overall  a lifestyle change  including a controlled diet and exercise  and adherence to medication is highly emphasized to manage Mr. H's condition. He will be closely monitored through regularly scheduled clinic follow-ups with vascular surgery and primary care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,32,Patient Presentation  Mr. Davis is a 76-year-old African-American male presenting with a primary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the right lower extremity accompanied with severe pain  skin ulcers  and gangrene. His medical history is significant with type 2 diabetes managed on medication  coronary artery disease with previous MI five years ago  hypertension  and hyperlipidaemia. Mr. Davis lives independently  is a widower  with adult children living in different states.  His home medications include Metformin  Aspirin  Amlodipine  and Atorvastatin. He reports being a former smoker  having quit about 10 years ago but admits to a 30 pack-year smoking history. He consumes alcohol only on special occasions and denies any illicit drug usage.   Family History  His father died of a myocardial infraction at 70 and his mother of stroke at 77. His older sister is managing her diabetes and younger brother is hypertensive. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  but the presence of cardiovascular diseases indicates a predisposition.  Current Complaint  Mr. Davis' complaints about ongoing right leg pain for several months  with a drastic increased severity in the last few weeks. He has recently noticed some skin discoloration and newly formed ulcers on his right foot. His pain is alleviated when his leg is in a dependent position but increased in an elevated position  a classic symptom of CLI.  Physical Examination  On examination  Mr. Davis' right lower extremity is cold to touch  with a bluish  shiny appearance  sparse hair  and thickened toenails. Palpable pulses are absent in the popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries. There are ulcerations on the foot  particularly on the sole and around the ankle area. Pedal pulses were robust on the left leg. His body mass index is 30 which indicates obesity.  Discussion  Given his age  race  and existing comorbidities  Mr. Davis represents a demographic that is at significant risk for CLI. Diabetes and smoking are both major risk factors for CLI  associated with an increased risk of amputation. CLI is more common after age 70 and in men. African Americans are disproportionately affected with higher amplitude  limb loss  and mortality rates.   His existing cardiovascular diseases  alongside CLI  predict a worse prognosis due to complex interplay between macrovascular and microvascular diseases  and presence of shared risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history.   Conclusively  an aggressive approach is necessary for treating Mr. Davis’ CLI  as well as optimizing his other comorbidities. This could potentially include surgical or endovascular revascularization methods in addition to pharmacological measures. His lifestyle and dietary habits should be thoroughly assessed and modified to potentially alleviate some of the symptoms and prevent the progress of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,33,Patient Presentation:  Woman  age 60; smoked for 40 years; African-American ethnicity; retired high school teacher living in a remote area of North Carolina with a low-income background.  Patient History:  The patient presents with critical limb ischemia diagnosed a month ago following complaints of pain in her left leg. It began as minor discomfort while walking but progressed to pain at rest and minimal movement. The patient also noticed her left leg becoming increasingly cooler compared to her right leg  and her left foot developed a bluish discoloration.  Past Medical History:  This patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes; both conditions have been poorly controlled over the past ten years. She had also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) five years prior to her current presentation.   Family History:  The patient's mother died following a stroke at age 70  and her father died from a heart attack at age 65. She has a younger brother with well-controlled hypertension and a sister with type 2 diabetes.   Review of Systems:  On physical examination  the patient's left leg was noted to be cool to the touch with decreased hair growth. Her left pedal pulses were weakly palpable  and capillary refill was prolonged relative to the right foot. No ulcers or gangrenous changes were noted on the skin of the left foot. She also has hypertension  with blood pressure consistently around 155/95 mmHg. A neurological exam showed no sensory or motor deficits  affirming that the neuropathy commonly associated with diabetes was not a contributing factor.  Management and Considerations:  Management strategies have been aimed at addressing her uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. Despite her medication non-compliance  the patient began taking antihypertensives and implemented a diabetic-friendly diet.  However  the main concern is the progression of her critical limb ischemia due to significant stenosis from her PAD. With her demographic representation  the patient belongs to a group with a higher risk of developing PAD. So  timely management and further intervention  likely angioplasty or bypass surgery  is required to avoid a major limb amputation.  Psychosocial aspects such as the patient's socioeconomic status  limited access to healthcare services  and understanding of her conditions also need to be recognized and managed for successful patient outcomes. The assistance of a social worker has been sought to help address these barriers.   In conclusion  this patient's case highlights the importance of well-controlled management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  especially in patients with a higher risk of developing PAD. Furthermore  it underscores the necessity of addressing psychosocial and socioeconomic factors when managing patients with complex medical conditions. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,34,Patient Introduction: Mr. Thompson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe pain in his left lower leg and foot.   Presenting Issues: Mr. Thompson has been experiencing rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and progressive gangrene in his left lower limb for the past two months. His past medical history reveals that the patient has been a diabetic for 25 years with suboptimal control due to financial restrictions and difficulty adhering to the prescribed regimen. He has a 30-year history of tobacco use  which contributes to his peripheral artery disease (PAD)  although he quit a decade ago. He also suffers from hypertension  managed with medication.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Tests: Upon examination  there were no palpable pulses below the popliteal level in the left lower limb. The skin was pallorous and cold compared to the contralateral limb. The Doppler ultrasound revealed a significant reduction in blood flow velocities  indicating critical limb ischemia (CLI). An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was undertaken which showed a value of 0.4  indicative of severe ischemia.   Family History: Mr. Thompson's family history includes his father  who had a stroke in his late sixties  and his mother  who suffered from type 2 diabetes and died due to kidney complications related to diabetes. His younger brother  now late 50s  also has diabetes.  Discussion: Given Mr. Thompson's medical history (diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and tobacco use)  combined with his family history  he was evidently in the high-risk group for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia  particularly within the African-American community.  Management and Treatment: Following the diagnosis  he was referred to a vascular surgeon who initiated treatment with antiplatelet therapy  statins  and pain control. Mr. Thompson also agreed to undergo vascular intervention to restore perfusion. Besides  he was referred to a diabetic educator  dietitian  and a smoking cessation program to manage and prevent exacerbation of his condition  considering his significant risk factors.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need for thorough health education  regular monitoring  and strict control of risk factors in patients with a history of diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. Further  it also highlights the disparities in managing chronic diseases like diabetes amongst individuals with low socio-economic status  which needs to be addressed in our healthcare system.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,35,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John  a 65-year-old African American male engineer  was admitted to the hospital with severe  persistent leg pain at rest that has worsened over the past week. He was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  Past Medical History:  Mr. John has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed eight years ago and uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus for about 15 years. He had been on immunoassay-controlled metformin and glipizide therapy. Despite this  his glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was consistently above the target value of 7%. His lipid profile was also abnormal  with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). He also has intermittent claudication for which he had been receiving medical treatment. He is a former smoker but quit approximately 15 years ago.  Family History:  Both his father and uncle had a history of peripheral arterial diseases and diabetes. His father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 75  and his mother passed away from a stroke at 72.   Social History:  He lives with his wife and his 30-year-old son. Mr. John is a retired engineer and spends most of his time reading or doing some stress-relief exercises. He denies any current or previous use of illicit drugs. He also denies any alcohol consumption.  Examination Findings:  On physical examination  the lower portion of the patient's right leg was remarkably cooler than the rest of his body. There were no palpable pulses in the right foot  and the left foot pulse was weaker than usual. His right foot exhibited significant pallor on elevation and rubor on dependency  a sign indicative of severe arterial insufficiency. A non-healing sore was found on his right foot  adding to the suspicion of critical limb ischemia.  Investigations:  Ankle-brachial index (ABI) showed reduced values in both of his legs  with the right being much lower than the left  indicating the severity of the arterial blockage in his right leg. A comprehensive angiography revealed significant stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. His blood glucose levels were elevated  and HbA1c level was 8.5%.  Clinical Management:  Conservative management  such as strict glycemic control  aspirin  statin therapy  and an exercise program  was not sufficient. Mr. John was offered an endovascular revascularization procedure to help restore blood flow to the damaged artery  and the prognosis was discussed.  Discussion:  Critical limb ischemia  primarily caused by peripheral arterial diseases  is a severe stage of PAD. African Americans  in particular  seem to have a higher risk of PAD. The presence of diabetes  poor diabetes control as well as smoking history  significantly elevates the likelihood of nerve damage and plaque buildup  leading to critical limb ischemia. Immediate revascularization is often required to save the limb because the risk of limb loss is high within the first few months following the onset of critical limb ischemia. Lifestyle modifications  addressing risk factors  and good glycemic control remain at the heart of long term management after revascularization in order to avoid recurrence.  (Common risk factors for Critical Limb Ischemia include age  smoking history  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  sedentary lifestyle  ethnicity - with African Americans having the highest risk  as well as a family history of peripheral artery disease.)
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,36,Patient Profile: A 68-year-old African American male patient presented to the clinic with complaints of worsening leg pain and non-healing sores on both feet.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension  previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 2 years ago. He is a heavy smoker with a 40-pack-year history  drinking habitually but moderately. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 5 years ago for severe coronary artery disease (CAD).  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at age 65 and his mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His younger brother  64  also suffers from PAD and diabetes.  Current Complaint: The patient reported experiencing pain in his legs for the last few months  which has been intensifying. He also developed non-healing ulcers on the toes of his right foot. The pain worsens when he walks and relieves when at rest. This classic claudication has negatively impacted his quality of life and overall mobility.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  both feet were cold to touch  with evident diminished pulses on palpation. The non-healing ulcers on his toes presented with a gangrenous appearance  indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Tests & Diagnosis: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test result was 0.4 (less than 0.9 is abnormal). A Doppler ultrasound revealed reduced blood flow in both lower extremities  confirming the previous diagnosis of PAD. Due to the development of the non-healing ulcers and severe  continuous pain  the patient was diagnosed with CLI.  Treatment Plan: The endovascular intervention was planned for the patient  considering his age and cardiovascular history. He needs rigorous blood sugar control and management  along with the cessation of smoking and possible participation in a supervised exercise program. The management of his hypertension  hyperglycemia  and lifestyle changes were recommended. If the endovascular intervention is not successful  he may need possible limb amputation.  This case focuses on CLI  a severe stage of PAD  which  if not treated promptly  can result in amputation or even death. High-risk populations for PAD and CLI include African American individuals  the elderly  those with a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and CAD  as observed in this patient's case.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,37,"Patient Information:      The patient is Mr. Alejandro Perez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male weighing approximately 90 kilograms and standing 5'7"""" feet tall. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife in San Diego  California.   Presenting Condition:  Mr. Perez presents to the clinic with complaints of non-healing sores on his feet that have persisted for over two months. He also reports persistent pain in calves upon walking and fatigue in legs.  Medical History:  Mr. Perez is a known hypertensive and was diagnosed five years ago. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled by metformin and insulin. In terms of surgical history  Mr. Perez had successfully undergone an appendectomy at age 32.  Current medications: Amlodipine 5 mg daily for hypertension  metformin 500 mg twice daily  Insulin glargine 20 units at night for diabetes mellitus and pain medications for leg pain.  Family History:   Alejandro reports that his father suffered a heart attack at age 60 and died of another heart attack at age 70. His mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in her late 50s.  Investigations:  A Doppler ultrasound showed significant arterial blockage in both lower extremities. Other investigations include a fasting blood glucose of 198 mg/dl  HbA1c 9.4%  Total cholesterol 220 mg/dL  LDL cholesterol 110 mg/dL  HDL cholesterol 34 mg/dL and triglycerides of 275 mg/dL.  Diagnosis:  Given his symptoms  medical history  family history  and results of the Doppler ultrasound  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made. CLI is a severe form of peripheral artery disease  a condition Mr. Perez is at a heightened risk for due to his diabetes and hypertension. It is more frequent in elderly patients with a higher prevalence among males and the Hispanic community.  Plan:  The patient received counsel to maintain strict control of blood glucose levels  cholesterol  and blood pressure  along with lifestyle modifications like quitting smoking  maintaining a healthy diet and moderate physical activity. Immediate vascular surgical consult was placed for revascularization to maximize blood flow to the affected extremity. The patient was put on antiplatelet and statin therapy to prevent further progression of disease while awaiting specialist consultation.  Follow-up:  Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor the healing process of the foot ulcers  blood glucose control  and cardiovascular health. The patient was instructed to follow the Mediterranean diet  check both feet daily for any new sores or ulcers  and enroll in a cardiovascular and diabetes education program. This case represents a high risk CLI case  demonstrating the need for early detection and immediate intervention to prevent limb loss and other severe complications."
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,38,Patient Introduction: Mrs. M is a 70-year-old African American woman from Albuquerque  New Mexico. She is a widow with three grown children.  Medical History: Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  non-insulin dependent and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3. She is a former smoker with a 45 pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. M presented at the emergency department with complaints of excruciating pain in her left foot  especially at night. She described the pain as unrelieved with rest and described it as a severe burning sensation. She also reported noticeable skin color changes  loss of hair on the affected limb  and persistent mild foot ulcers that have been present for the past three weeks.   Examination and Tests: Upon examination  significant findings included diminished pulses in the left foot  black discoloration on her toe  and a non-healing ulcer on the great toe. An ankle-brachial index was performed that showed an index of 0.3 on the left side. Doppler ultrasound revealed multilevel peripheral arterial disease with complete occlusion of the left posterior tibial artery.   Diagnosis: Based on her medical history  clinical symptoms  and findings from the diagnostic investigations  Ms. M was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Risk Factors: Several risk factors contributed to her condition. Primarily  her history of T2DM and CKD played a major role. African Americans have been reported to have a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease  the underlying cause of CLI. Her hypertension  dyslipidemia  and previous smoking history also increased her risk significantly.  Family History: There is a history of cardiovascular diseases in her family with her late husband dying from a stroke  and her father and two siblings having coronary artery disease.   Treatment Plan: A multidisciplinary team involving a vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  nephrologist  and wound care specialist was formed for her care. After evaluation  she was scheduled for revascularization. She was also started on pharmacological therapy for CLI with antiplatelet and antihypertensives. Insulin therapy was optimized for better glucose control and specialists are working towards managing her CKD. Her family was educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications and optimum disease control measures.   Conclusion: Given Mrs. M's comorbid conditions and risk factors  a multi-faceted approach was taken to address her CLI. This includes surgical intervention  pharmaceutical control of her chronic conditions  lifestyle changes  and consistent monitoring of progress. Her case highlights the challenge in managing CLI in patients with multiple comorbidities.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,39,Patient Information: Mr. Benjamin Brown; a 76-year-old African-American male  Presenting Complaint: Intermittent claudication  rest pain in the right lower extremity  and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled) and hypertension. He is also a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but had a 30 pack/year history.  Family History: There’s a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 68  and his elder brother had a stroke at age 73.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  he appears frail and in obvious distress from the pain. His right lower leg lacks hair  the skin is shiny  and the temperature is markedly reduced compared to the left leg. Pedal pulses were absent on the right side  whereas his left lower limb had normal pulses. A non-healing ulcer on his right foot  which he claimed appeared about a month ago  is noticed.  Diagnostic Findings: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was done  revealing a value of 0.4 on his right side  whereas the left side showed a normal value (1.2). A Doppler ultrasound showed a significant reduction in the blood flow in his right lower extremity compared to the left. Fasting blood glucose levels were elevated  reinforcing his uncontrolled diabetes. Lipid profile showed hyperlipidemia.  Impression: Based on the clinical features  family  and medical history  the physical findings  and diagnostic results  Mr. Brown was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the right lower extremity.  Plan: He was referred to a vascular surgeon for further interventional treatment  which may include angioplasty  stenting  or bypass surgery based on the severity of the disease. He was also advised on better glycemic control and was referred to a dietitian for counselling. Further consultations were arranged with a podiatrist for wound care and a physiotherapist for exercises to promote blood circulation.  Case Note: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease predominantly affecting elderly patients  is often associated with high morbidity and mortality. CLI is particularly prevalent in patients with smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia – as seen in Mr. Brown's case. Therefore  managing these risk factors plays a crucial role in overall treatment strategy. This case exemplifies the need for consequent multidisciplinary management  encompassing interventional treatments  glycemic control  and lifestyle modifications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,40,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is retired and lives in a suburban region. He has a past medical history significant for peripheral artery disease (PAD)  hypertension (HTN)  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2) and hyperlipidemia. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. Smith presented with progressive pain on his left lower leg  predominantly experienced for the last six months. The pain started getting more intense and became persistent throughout the day  particularly while at rest. Recently  he has also noticed slight color changes and wound formation. There was no history of trauma  fever  or other systemic symptoms.   Physical Examination:  Patient vital signs were within the normal range. Upon examination  his left foot appeared dusky. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were absent bilaterally. There is mild to moderate edema but no evidence of cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis. Ulcerations were noted on the left toes with no evidence of gangrene.  Imaging and Laboratory Findings:  Angiography elucidated severe stenosis of the left popliteal artery and multilevel tibial artery occlusions consistent with his diagnosis of CLI. Lab findings revealed controlled blood sugar and slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels.  Family History:  His father had a history of myocardial infarction at an age above 55 and his mother had a history of stroke. Mr. Smith has two elder brothers  one diagnosed with PAD  supporting a familial predisposition to atherosclerosis.  Management:  Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed which resulted in significant improvement in blood flow. He was advised for a regular follow-up. A team comprising of an endocrinologist and nutritionist was involved for better diabetes management. Likewise  the patient was prescribed antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications and a strict exercise regime.  Discussion:  CLI is a severe obstructive disease of the peripheral arteries which could lead to amputation if not treated timely. It is more common in those over 60  the elderly  males  and those with underlying medical conditions like diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension  as seen in Mr. Smith. Direct genetic influences or conditions that run in families  such as diabetes or obesity  can increase the risk of developing PAD and consequently CLI. The goal of treatment is to save the limb  reduce symptoms  and improve function. Critical limb ischemia  if diagnosed early  can be managed conservatively or by endovascular means.   References: 1.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,41,Patient Information:  The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male who has been a chronic smoker for more than fifty years. He has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). His prior medical history includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  which he has been managing successfully for the past ten years. He has been on regular medication for these comorbidities and adheres to lifestyle and dietary structures.  His family history includes a mother who had a stroke at the age of 70 and a father who underwent amputation due to undiagnosed peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The patient is married  retired  and has a moderate financial status.  Presenting Concerns:  The patient visited the clinic with complaints of severe pain in his right lower extremity  especially during movement. He reported experiencing intermittent claudication for several years that had recently worsened to constant pain. He has noticed color changes in his toes and had a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe.  Diagnostic Findings:  Physical examination showed that the patient's right foot was cool to touch and had reduced capillary refill. Doppler ultrasound studies indicated significantly reduced blood flow in the distal arteries of the patient’s right leg. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  which was less than 0.4  confirming the diagnosis of CLI.  Management and Recommendations:  Under the care of a vascular surgeon  the patient was advised to undergo angiogram studies to identify the specific arterial blockages. Based on his medical history  current health status  and family history  amputation could be a potential treatment.  The patient was also advised to stop smoking immediately. Lifestyle modifications are crucial with better control of his diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol levels being of utmost importance.  Conclusion:  This patient's case highlights the devastating effects of CLI  particularly when multiple comorbitizing factors such as smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of vascular disease are present. Early identification and management of risk factors and the disease itself are of paramount importance in managing CLI and increasing the patient's quality of life. Treatment plans must be tailored individually considering the patient's overall health condition  family support  and financial situations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,42,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 75-year-old African American male who lives independently. He had made an appointment to his primary care physician for progressive pain in his right calf over the past two months. The pain was initially intermittent  occurring mostly in the evenings following physical activities  but has become prolonged and constant over time  now interfering with his sleep. He also reports a few episodes of numbness and coldness in his right foot  which subsided after a few minutes each time.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J is a known case of hypertension for the past ten years  controlled on medication. He also has diabetes mellitus type 2 for seven years  for which he is taking oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of smoking for 40 years but quit five years back. There's a surgical history of appendectomy in his 30s  and intermittent episodes of erysipelas treated with antibiotics.  Family History:  His father and elder brother had cardiac issues. His mother suffered from arthritis and hypertension. He has two siblings who are reportedly healthy.  Demographics:   As per literature  individuals of African American ethnicity are likely to suffer more from peripheral artery disease than other ethnicities. It is especially common among adults >60 years  those with hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking and appears to have a genetic predisposition as well.  Other Pertinent Information:  On examination  his right lower limb was noticeably colder than his left. His popliteal and pedal pulses were palpable but diminished on the right side. Blood tests showed slightly uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Based on the history  empirical findings  and his ethnic and habitual predisposition  Mr. J is suspected of having Critical Limb Ischemia. To confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent and severity  further investigations like Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and duplex ultrasonography were suggested.   This is a brief case presentation of a patient with probable Critical Limb Ischemia. The prognosis of CLI is generally poor without intervention. On identification  the patient must be given comprehensive care which includes optimizing comorbid conditions  lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and advice regarding structured exercise therapy  revascularization procedures if indicated  and overall cardiovascular risk reduction to improve the long-term outcomes. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,43,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 69-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  living in south California. He came to the emergency department presenting with increasing pain in his right lower limb  particularly noting severe pain in the calf muscle after walking a short distance. This has been ongoing for the past month  and now  the pain has become persistent even at rest. During the consultation  he characteristically ranked the pain as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale in severity. He also mentioned a cold sensation in his foot and slower healing of minor wounds in his right lower leg.  Medical History:  On reviewing his past medical history  it was found that Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 15 years ago  and he had been battling hypertension and high cholesterol for the past 20 years. Mr. Johnson is a former smoker  with a 35 pack-year smoking history  but quit almost five years ago. Further investigation into his surgical history revealed that he had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft 6 years prior due to ischemic heart disease.  Family History:  His family history reveals that his father had died due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 72. Mr. Johnson has an older brother living with type II diabetes and a younger sister who suffers from hypertension.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis:  Physical examination revealed noticeable muscle atrophy and a weak pulse in the right lower limb compared to the left. His right foot appeared pale and cool to touch  with minimal hair growth and weakly felt dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  A comprehensive vascular evaluation  which included an Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and imaging studies like CT angiogram  confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Plan:  Mr. Johnson would be started on antiplatelet and statin therapy as both risk reduction strategies and to manage existing comorbidities. He will be referred to a vascular specialist for possible revascularization procedures. Active engagement with a dietician and diabetes nurse educator is a must to optimize his glycemic control. His case highlights the importance of preventive measures  early detection  and management of atherosclerotic risk factors  given his past medical and family history.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,45,Patient Description: Mr. John Smith  a 67-year-old African American male  has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a taxi driver living in Baltimore  Maryland  with his wife  who is a retired school teacher. He has two adult children living out-of-state.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a known hypertensive and diabetic patient  effectively controlled on medications for the last ten years. Previous history includes managing Hyperlipidemia but had no known clinical signs or symptoms of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). His blood pressure averages at 130/80 mmHg and fasting blood sugar ranges between 100-120 mg/dl. He has a smoking history of 20 years  but quitted smoking five years back. He also has mild COPD secondary to his smoking. He takes aspirin and statins.  Presenting Complaints and Clinical Examination: Two months back  Mr. Smith noticed that his left foot was becoming progressively numb and discolored. He also experienced ulceration and rest pain. Upon direct examination  his PhD-ABI (Ankle-brachial index) showed results consistent with CLI (<0.4). His lower limb showed signs of gangrene on his left foot.    Family History: Mr. Smith's parents have a history of hypertension  with his father dying of myocardial infarction at 72 years. His mother is 90 and suffers from arthritis. His younger sister  aged 65 years  is hypertensive and diabetic  similar to him. There's no known family history of CLI or PAD.  Investigation Results: His echocardiography was normal. Resting ECG showed signs consistent with previous myocardial ischemia. His angiography showed multi-level occlusive disease involving his left superficial femoral  popliteal  and distal arteries leading to his CLI.  Treatment and Current Status: Endovascular therapy including angioplasty and stent placements have been planned for him after vascular surgery consultation. He has been prescribed analgesics for pain relief. Mr. Smith's diabetes and hypertension are under control  but given the advanced stage of CLI  his overall prognosis is guarded. He and his family are educated on the critical nature of his condition and importance of strict glycemic and hypertensive control.  Ethical Consideration: Patient's consent was taken for the treatment plan  with risks and benefits explained in detail. His cultural beliefs were taken into consideration during the treatment plan.  In considering this case  attention must be paid to factors contributing to African Americans' higher risk for CLI as found in literature  including socioeconomic status  comorbidities such as diabetes  and other potentially contributing lifestyle factors.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,46,Patient Presentation: Mr. John Kim  a 69-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with severe  persistent pain in his left leg. This pain intensified over the past three weeks. He mentioned he also has a burning sensation and numbness  especially in the calf region extending to his foot. He still has normal mobility but reported feeling discomfort during walks or even while resting  and this pain has been disrupting his sleep.  Past Medical History: Mr. Kim has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II for over 15 years  which has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of hypertension for two decades  controlled with antihypertensive medication. He has no history of coronary artery disease  cerebrovascular disease  chronic kidney disease  or other endocrine diseases. He quit smoking 10 years ago  but his total cumulative smoking history is approximated at 30 pack-years.  Mr. Kim has had a prior history of peripheral arterial disease diagnosed five years back. His latest Ankle-brachial index (ABI) 6 months back was 0.6. He has not undertaken any invasive procedures like angioplasty or atherectomy. His health has been stable until these new symptoms begun to surface.  Family History: His mother had suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis and his father had Hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus; both parents are deceased. He has a younger sister who was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.  Examination: On examination  his left lower limb is cold to touch with mottling and appeared progressively paler than the contralateral limb. He has weak distal pulses in his left leg. Sensation is diminished distally. A non-healing ulcer was found on his left big toe on examination.  Laboratory investigations: His blood glucose levels were found to be elevated with HbA1c at 8.5%  serum creatinine  blood count  liver function test  and lipid profile were normal. Duplex ultrasound of left lower limb showed a significant reduction in blood flow.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient’s symptoms  past medical history of diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and peripheral arterial disease  physical findings and lab investigations  Mr. Kim was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Plan: Mr. Kim's diagnostics and treatment included immediate pain management followed by endovascular angioplasty for the revascularization of left lower limb to restore the blood flow and prevent amputation. Furthermore  a comprehensive management plan was recommended that included optimization of his blood glucose levels and hypertension  low-dose aspirin therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events  and lifestyle modifications to mitigate disease progression.  The patient's case underlines the importance of early identification and timely intervention of Peripheral Arterial Diseases among high-risk patients such as those with Diabetes Mellitus and a history of smoking. It reminds us that CLI could be a preventable complication when appropriate  and proactive measures are put in practice.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,47,Patient Presentation:   Mr. M  a 72-year-old African-American male  has been admitted to the vascular ward with severe leg pain consistent with a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He has not been previously diagnosed with peripheral artery disease or any other types of ischemic vascular disease. His relevant utilization of medication includes daily low-dose aspirin and Amlodipine for hypertension.  Past Medical History:   His past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension in the last ten years  type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed approximately 8 years ago  and hyperlipidemia. He quit smoking ten years ago after a 40 pack-year smoking history. He struggles with his diabetes control  although he adheres to his daily Metformin dosing regimen. He has no known allergy.  Family History:  His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 66  and his elder sister was recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. No known genetic disorders or malignant conditions run in his immediate family.  Clinical Examination & Diagnosis:  Upon examination  Mr. M exhibited rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his left foot  which are signs of advanced CLI. The reversed-flow Doppler signal in his left posterior tibial and peroneal arteries confirmed poor peripheral circulation. A palpable right dorsalis pedis pulse and a non-palpable left dorsalis pedis pulse were noted on the physical assessment.   Being an older adult African-American male with a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and poorly controlled diabetes puts Mr. M at a higher risk for developing CLI  as these demographics and factors are associated with a greater prevalence of peripheral artery disease and subsequently CLI.  Management:  The patient has been referred to a vascular surgeon given the critical nature of his condition. He has been suggested surgical or endovascular revascularization procedures to restore his blood flow. Adjustments to his medication  stricter diabetes management  wound care intervention for his foot ulcers  and lifestyle modifications  including diet  are also being considered.  Conclusion:  Mr. M's case highlights how various lifestyle and hereditary factors contribute to the development of CLI - a severe condition requiring urgent care. Educating patients about the importance of managing risk factors can help prevent the development and progression of ischemic vascular diseases.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,48,Case Presentation  Patient Information: Our patient  Mr. Alfredo Mendoza  a 67-year-old Hispanic man  presents with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He is a retired construction worker  currently lives alone in San Antonio  Texas. He is widowed with 3 adult children - two sons and a daughter  all of whom are in good health.  Main Complaint: Mr. Mendoza reports severe and constant pain in his lower left leg  even when at rest  which started roughly two weeks prior. There are also intermittent instances of numbness and coldness in the affected limb. Notably  he has developed an ulcer on his left foot.  Medical History: Mr. Mendoza has a medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) for the past fifteen years  along with Hypertension (HTN) and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)  the latter diagnosed five years back. He also has a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit smoking 3 years ago.   Family History: His parents suffered from cardiovascular disease. His father experienced his first myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and passed away due to second one  by age 70. His mother is living with HTN and T2DM. No history of PAD or CLI in direct family.  Extracurricular History: Mr. Mendoza denies substance abuse  with the exception of nicotine. He consumes alcohol socially and his diet largely consists of traditional Hispanic food  which he admits might have led to his current condition. He has led an active life  reflecting a moderate amount of exercise.   Treatment History: His past treatment includes Metformin for T2DM and Lisinopril for HTN. At the time of PAD diagnosis  lifestyle changes were recommended and he was put on antiplatelet medication (low-dose Aspirin) and a Statin drug.  Preliminary Analysis: On physical examination  the patient's left leg is cooler than his right and there's diminished peripheral pulse  with an ulcer present on the toe. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is below 0.4 - a strong indication of CLI. Non-invasive vascular imaging to be done for better understanding of the stage of CLI.  This case presentation features Mr. Mendoza as a typical case of CLI incurring from a long history of diabetes  hypertension  and PAD which are its major causes  along with his Hispanic heritage making him prone to these pre-existing conditions according to several studies. It underscores the compounded risks of such chronic conditions manifesting into severe disorders like CLI. Further vascular examination and a consultation with a Cardiovascular Specialist would benefit Mr. Mendoza's case.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,49,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. Daniels Age: 75 Gender: Male Race: African American Marital status: Widowed  Present Illness:  Mr. Daniels was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the right lower extremity. He complained of rest pain in his right leg  particularly at night. The patient frequently wakes up due to severe pain and can only achieve relief by placing the leg in a dependent position.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Daniels has had a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years  both of which are controlled with medication. He is also a former smoker who quit ten years ago  but had a 30-pack-year smoking history prior to cessation. Mr. Daniels had experienced subacute ischemic symptoms like claudication for the last five years  initially blaming the symptoms on age and decreased physical activity levels.  Family History:  His mother died at the age of 90 due to complications of a stroke while his father died from complications of metastatic lung cancer at the age of 78. His younger brother  65  has been living with coronary artery disease (CAD) for a decade. There is no other significant family history of note.  Physical Examination:  Mr. Daniels weighed approximately 65 kg with a height of 5’7”. He was cooperative but appeared anxious. Vitals on admission were: BP -156/88 mm Hg  HR - 92 bpm  RR - 16/min  Temp - 98.6F  and SpO2 - 95% on room air.   In the physical examination  his right foot was found to be cold to touch. There were no palpable popliteal and foot pulses in the right leg. The foot had a bluish discoloration  and there was a non-healing ulcer on the heel. Patellar and Achilles reflexes were decreased. There were no other significant findings upon examination of other systems.  Laboratory results indicated Diabetes Mellitus  with an HbA1c of 9.0%  reinforcing the ischemia as a likely cause of the patient's symptoms. His lipid profile and renal function test were also slightly above the upper limit of the normal reference range.  Summary:  Mr. Daniels  a 75 year old male with a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and smoking  presented with rest pain in his right leg consistent with CLI. His symptoms over the last five years and his ischemic ulcer reflect the diagnosis. Multiple risk factors are present for arterial disease  including his personal medical history and a family history of CAD. Management for Mr. Daniels should focus on risk factor modification  pharmacological therapy  revascularization techniques  and potentially amputation if necessary. His case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of risk factors for CLI to prevent disease progression and limb loss.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,51,Patient Profile:  Mr. X is a 67-year-old African American male who lives independently with his wife in an urban community. He is a retired civil engineer. He has a 30-year history of moderate-to-severe hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has a significant family history; his father had coronary artery disease and his mother had cerebrovascular disease.  Presenting Conversation: Mr. X presented to the office with a 1-month history of non-healing sores on his left foot and severe pain in his lower leg confining him to his house  resulting in decreased movement. He also reported intermittent pain in his legs during the past 6 months  especially after exerting himself.   Diagnostic Measures: These symptoms  together with his history  raised concerns about peripheral artery disease (PAD). A lower extremity arterial evaluation  which included ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing  was ordered. Mr. X’s ABI was calculated as 0.49  which is substantially below the normal range (0.91–1.3)  indicating PAD. Given the severe symptoms and a significantly low ABI score  a duplex ultrasound was performed to further assess the blood flow in the patient's lower extremity  which confirmed his critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Treatment  Prognosis  and Follow-Up: Mr. X was referred immediately to a vascular specialist for further treatment decisions. Based on Mr. X’s symptoms  imaging findings  and the severity of the disease  endovascular intervention was pursued. Following the intervention  Mr. X was prescribed dual antiplatelet drugs and high-intensity statin therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction. He was also advised to keep his blood sugar and blood pressure under control and quit smoking.   Weekly follow-ups were advised to assess recovery as well as to provide a wound care plan. The patient was also encouraged to engage in a structured exercise program to improve walking distance and alleviate symptoms.   In conclusion  considering Mr. X’s non-healing lower limb wound  severe rest pain  positive family history and underlying chronic conditions  early diagnosis followed by an appropriate multidisciplinary approach was utilized to prevent the risk of limb loss due to critical limb ischemia. The follow-up plan includes aggressive modification of risk factors along with regular surveillance and prompt management of potential issues.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,52,Patient Presentation:  This report concerns a 72-year-old African American male patient who presents with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His presenting symptoms include consistent  severe pain in his right leg  coldness  lack of pulse  slow hair and nail growth  and a deep  non-healing ulcer on the heel. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and coronary artery disease.  Patient details: The patient  a retired mechanic  lives with his wife of 47 years in an urban setting. He is a former smoker  quitting approximately 20 years ago  and he drinks alcohol in moderation. His physical activity is minimal due to chronic arthritic pain in his knees and back.  Past Medical History: The patient has been managing type 2 diabetes for 18 years with Metformin and insulin injections. His hypertension is controlled with Losartan and a thiazide diuretic. Despite a recent surgical intervention for coronary artery disease  his cardiovascular health remains compromised. Furthermore  he has been struggling with obesity (BMI 33) over the past ten years. These comorbidities have all contributed to his current diagnosis of CLI.  Current Medication: In addition to antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications  he is also on a daily regimen of low-dose Aspirin and Atorvastatin for cardio-protection.  Family History: The patient's family history is notable for early-onset cardiovascular disease. His father died of a heart attack at age 62 and one of his brothers at age 56. Both of his parents had type 2 diabetes along with his eldest sister who also had a stroke at 68.  Patient's Lifestyle: Currently  the patient lives a sedentary lifestyle due to the progression of his conditions. His diet includes a significant amount of processed food and he shows a minimal understanding of diabetes-friendly nutrition. The patient demonstrates poor adherence to his medication regimen and has not been involved in any cardiovascular rehabilitation program since his coronary bypass surgery.  Conclusion: This patient's history of metabolic syndrome  cardiovascular disease along with age  race  and lifestyle factors have contributed to the progression of peripheral artery disease and the development of critical limb ischemia. Future management of this case will require an aggressive therapeutic approach including potential revascularization  strict glycemic control  lifestyle modifications and diligent wound care. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,53,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John A  a 68-year-old African American male  with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  was brought into the emergency department with chief complaints of excruciating  unrelenting pain in his right lower limb along with skin discoloration.  Demographics:  Mr. A is a retired Army veteran. He lives with his wife and is a resident of an urban neighborhood in Chicago  Illinois. He's a lifelong non-smoker  although his diet primarily consists of high sodium and cholesterol-rich foods  and he does not engage in regular physical activity; this has led to obesity (BMI of 31.5).   Past Medical History:  He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago but had low adherence to his insulin regimen and oral hypoglycemic agents  leading to poor glycemic control with HbA1c levels consistently >8%. He was diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia 10 years ago. A diagnosis of PAD was made following an ankle-brachial index of 0.70 around 8 years back.  Present Complaint:  He reported a 1-month history of intermittent claudication with a pain-free walking distance of less than 50 meters and rest pain for the last week  which made him seek medical attention. On examination  his right lower limb was cool to touch  had noticeable pallor  and diminished pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. There was also the presence of an ulcer on the right heel with surrounding discoloration suggestive of impending gangrene.  Family History:  His father had died of an MI at the age of 62 and had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. His mother had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and lived up to 78 years of age. His elder sister aged 70 years has been suffering from type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Impression:  The patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) based on the history of PAD  clinical presentation of rest pain  presence of an ulcer  and physical examination. This conclusion was supported by critical stenosis (>70%) in the distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery  observed in the contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the right lower limb. Minimal blood flow to the foot was confirmed by toe-brachial index <0.2.  This case presentation indicates the common demographic trend for CLI  as it’s more prevalently observed in people aged 50 years or older  African Americans  and individuals with a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia. Being male and having a relative with a heart disease amplifies the risk which is the case here with Mr. A. The treatment plan  considering the need for aggressive intervention  involved endovascular revascularization owing to his lifestyle limitations.  References: 1. Norgren  L.  et al. (2007).

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,54,Patient Information: Patient: Mr. A Age: 58 Gender: Male Occupation: Truck driver Marital Status: Married with two grown children  Presenting Problem: Mr. A presents with rest pain in his right lower limb and gangrene of his two right toes. His pain escalates at night and involves his entire foot.  Past and Current Medical History: Mr. A has been a smoker  smoking approximately one pack per day for the past 36 years  with no attempts at cessation. He has a known 10-year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is currently controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has been hypertensive for the past seven years and takes an ACE inhibitor.   Family History: His father died at the age of 64 due to myocardial infarction. His mother  aged 75  is alive with hypertension. He has one brother  aged 53  with no known illnesses.  Social History: He has worked as a truck driver for almost 30 years and describes his lifestyle as sedentary. He admits to consuming alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug use.  Physical Examination: Patient appears pallor and discomfort due to pain. His right foot is cold to touch  with weak pulses felt in the right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis. Two gangrenous toes noticed on the right foot.  Investigations: The color Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs indicates severe stenosis at the level of the right popliteal artery and multiple smaller occlusions in the distal vessels. An angiogram confirmed this finding. Other biological tests  including complete blood count  liver and kidney function tests  lipid profile  and glycemic control  are within acceptable limits  considering his existing comorbidities.  Management: Given the severe pain and gangrene  limb salvage seems challenging  and he needs immediate intervention. A vascular multidisciplinary team meeting considering revascularization via bypass surgery or angioplasty; if not suitable  possible amputation may be discussed. He requires further education about his disease process and lifestyle modifications  necessary for his overall management.  This case represents a typical presentation of a patient with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral arterial disease common among the smoking and diabetic population. It emphasizes the importance of early detection  risk factor management  and a multidisciplinary approach for managing complex cases of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,55,Patient Details:   Mr. Robert Black  an African American male aged 68 years  hailing from Denver  Colorado  was admitted to our vascular department last week. He has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  primarily affecting his left lower limb.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Black has been managing type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. Records indicate that his blood glucose levels have been poorly controlled. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 8 years ago and was prescribed antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications respectively. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  after a smoking history of 1 pack a day for 30 years. Mr. Black had a stroke at age 60  but has made a good recovery. He is also known to suffer from peripheral neuropathy  a complication of his longstanding diabetes.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Black came with complaints of severe pain in his left foot that had been worsening continuously over the previous few months. He also reported an ulcer that was not healing on the big toe of his left foot and intermittent claudication.  Family History:  Mr. Black's father died of a myocardial infarction at age 75 and his mother had a history of stroke in her late 60s. His older brother  aged 71  suffers from peripheral artery disease  and his 65-year-old sister has well-managed type 2 diabetes.  Demographics and Other Pertinent Information:  Mr. Black is retired after having worked for many years as an electrician. He lives alone  since his wife passed away two years ago. His children live out of state and visit occasionally. His diet is suboptimal due to lack of motivation to cook for one. He also indicates that he finds it hard to stay physically active due to constant foot pain.  Literature information:  Studies show that critical limb ischemia disproportionately affects older adults  particularly those over age 60. Diabetic patients  like Mr. Black  are particularly at risk  and the risk increases with age. African Americans are also known to experience CLI more frequently compared to other races. Smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetic control are all significant risk factors that have played a role in Mr. Black's case. Hence  Mr. Black’s case aligns with the demographic representation in the literature.  Management:  Mr. Black has been recommended for a lower extremity angiogram to evaluate the blood flow to his extremities  as this can guide further treatment. He will continue his current management for diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. A revascularization procedure may be needed depending upon the angiogram results. He is being referred to a dietician and a chiropodist and will also be receiving home care support.  This case demonstration underscores the importance of primary prevention  early diagnosis  and appropriate management of comorbidities  especially in older adults  diabetics  hypertensive  and individuals with high cholesterol levels. It will be critical to closely monitor Mr. Black's progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,56,Patient Case Presentation:   Demographic Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male named Mr. JB. He is retired and lives with his wife in a rural area  where they have resided for over 35 years. He has two adult children  both of them are living out-of-state.   Past Medical History: Mr. JB has been previously diagnosed with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and has a 30-year history of hypertension. He also has suffered from hyperlipidemia and was a moderate smoker before quitting ten years ago. Mr. JB was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease five years ago  but he didn’t adhere to the prescribed medications or lifestyle modifications consistently.   Family History: Mr. JB's family history revealed his father had hypertension and died of a heart attack in his early 70s. His mother had type 2 diabetes  and she lived into her late 80s. Mr. JB's older brother  who is 70 years old  was recently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. JB presented with a two-week history of progressively worsening  right lower extremity rest pain  and a non-healing ulcer on the right toe. The pain partially relieved by hanging the foot over the bedside and worsens when he lies down. The ulcer started as a small blister and has progressed to expose the underlying tissues without any signs of infection.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  his right lower extremity is cool to touch  with weak or absent pedal pulses. An ulcer of 1cm diameter noticed on the dorsal surface of the right great toe  with blackish discoloration of the surrounding skin. His left leg appears normal with palpable pulses.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical findings  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Work-up and Treatment: Further diagnostic workup confirmed the diagnosis including non-invasive vascular studies and angiography. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for possible revascularization procedures. Meanwhile  medical management was intensified with glycemic control  antihypertensive  antiplatelet therapy  and lipid-lowering agent. He was also advised for optimal foot care and stop smoking and to follow a healthy diet plan.   This case presentation highlights the importance of vigilance in managing and controlling the risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension  and the necessity to follow the prescribed medications and lifestyle changes in patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease to prevent advancement to Critical Limb Ischemia.

He is a retired postal worker and lives with his 69-year-old wife. The couple has two adult children  both in good health.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He previously mentioned experiencing recurrent foot ulcers and has been a smoker for the last 35 years. His BMI falls into the obese range (BMI 32.5). He is currently on insulin therapy  atorvastatin for dyslipidemia and losartan for hypertension. The patient has also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) five years ago.  Family History: Both of his parents had type 2 diabetes  and his father succumbed to myocardial infarction at the age of 70. The patient's older brother underwent a below-knee amputation due to critical limb ischemia related to poorly controlled diabetes at the age of 78. His two children are hale and hearty with no chronic medical illnesses to date.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient came in reporting progressively worsening rest pain in his left foot over the past two weeks. The patient also notes intermittent claudication that has increased frequency during this time.  Physical exam: Physical examination revealed diminished peripheral pulses below his left knee  a cold and pale left foot  and an ulcer on the lateral aspect of his left foot with black necrotic tissue noted around the edges.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Ankle-brachial index came back markedly low  and Doppler ultrasound showed severe obstructive calcified plaque within the distal portion of the left superficial femoral artery and both arteries in his lower left leg.  Management: Due to poor quality of life associated with chronic rest pain and the risk for major limb amputation  the patient has been referred to our vascular surgery department. He will be evaluated for potential revascularization procedures to restore blood flow  with amputation being the last resort.  Social situation: The patient and his family report significant distress due to his progressive symptoms and the risk of amputation. They have been referred to local support groups and will meet with a social worker to discuss potential resources.  Treatment strategies and lifestyle modifications  including a structured exercise program  smoking cessation  optimal diabetes control  and the use of antiplatelets/anticoagulants  have been emphasized to the patient and his family to prevent disease progression and manage symptomatology. The patient remains anxious but cooperative and willing to make the necessary changes towards improving his condition. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,58,Patient Presentation  Patient Identification: Mr. J  Gender: Male  Age: 68 years old  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting complaint: constant leg pain  ulcers on left foot  Past Medical History: History of Type 2 Diabetes for the past 15 years  controlled with Metformin. Hypertensive for 10 years managed with Lisinopril. Former smoker  quit 10 years ago but had a 30-pack year history. Underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease 5 years ago.  Family history: Father died from myocardial infarction at 75. Mother had a stroke at 87 and died at 90. Younger brother has COPD due to smoking.  Current Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  low-dose aspirin.  Physical Examination: BP: 140/90 mmHg  PR: 80 bpm  RR:18 breaths per minute  Pulse in left foot: diminished.  Lab Results: HbA1C - 7.8%  fasting lipid profile - elevated levels of LDL cholesterol  Fasting glucose - elevated.  Findings: Doppler examination revealed significantly decreased blood flow in the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery of the left leg. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.7 on the left side.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation  symptoms  medical history  and Doppler findings  the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Plan: Multidisciplinary team discussion proposed. Surgical consultation obtained for potential revascularization. Conservative management of CLI initiated  including pain management  optimization of diabetes control  and management of ulcers. Patient educated on the importance of regular foot care  a healthy diet  and physical activity.   The patient represents typical demographic information found in literature on CLI patients - elderly  male  Caucasian  with comorbidities including uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  history of smoking  and CAD.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,59,Patient Profile:  Mr. Samuel Reyes  a 63-year-old African American male  has presented himself to the hospital with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower limb  predominantly during the night. He reports that the pain is occasionally accompanied by ulceration and gangrene formation at the tips of his toes.  Previous Medical History: Mr. Reyes has a known history of type 2 diabetes for approximately 15 years and hypertension for roughly ten years  both being medicated. Additionally  he suffered a mild heart attack seven years ago. Ever since he's ceased smoking but continues to struggle with obesity  suggested by his body mass index (BMI) of 31. Recently  he’s been experiencing increased fatigue while walking short distances.  Family History: His family history is remarkable with an early death of his father due to myocardial infarction at the age of 57. His mother is alive  suffers from diabetes and hypertension similar to him  and is currently 82 years old. He also has a younger brother aged 60  who was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given his symptoms  past medical history and risk factors  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was considered. Several tests were conducted for confirmation  including an ankle-brachial index  pulse volume recording  and angiography. The results confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Plan: The patient underwent revascularization to improve blood flow to the affected limb. However  due to the severity of the disease and his significant risk factors  it was suggested that amputation might be necessary if the limb does not respond to treatment swiftly. The patient was also referred to a dietitian for nutritional advice to manage obesity and consulted with a diabetic educator to ensure that blood sugar levels are adequately maintained.  Patient counseling for possible outcomes was performed. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor the response of the limb to treatment and ascertain whether any adverse effects are arising from the procedure.  Critical limb ischemia  predominantly noted in older individuals and males  can be significantly worse in African Americans  similar to our patient. This case underscores the importance of early detection and timely intervention in managing critical limb ischemia and the significance of managing comorbidities to improve treatment outcomes. It also emphasizes the need for clinicians to consider a patient's ethnic background and associated increased risk while planning treatment.   Sources: 1. Mustapha JA  Katzen BT  Neville RF  et al.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,60,Patient Presentation: Mr. Jose Martinez  a 56-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the outpatient vascular clinic with complaints of ongoing pain in his left lower extremity. He describes the pain as a stabbing sensation in his calf which intensifies when he walks and eases when he rests. For a week now  he has also been experiencing numbness in his foot  along with a persistent  burning cold feeling. On examination  his left foot was observed to be paler compared to the right  suggestive of decreased blood circulation. In the absence of a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse and weak  slow capillary refill  the clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was confirmed by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.3.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years and Hypertension for 10 years  which have been poorly controlled due to non-compliance with medication and inconsistent follow-up visits. He is also a heavy smoker (20 cigarettes per day for the past 30 years).  Family History: His father died from an acute myocardial infarction in his 60s  his mother had a history of hypertension and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  both elder siblings have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Social History: Mr. Martinez works as a mechanic and lives with his wife and three children. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. His diet mainly comprises fast food. He is a chronic alcoholic.  Summary: In the context of Mr. Martinez's long-term uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  chronic heavy smoking  and positive family history of cardiovascular diseases  the diagnosis of CLI is highly plausible. The combination of his ethnic background (Hispanic)  male gender  and age also increases his risk  aligning with epidemiological data that suggests CLI is more prevalent in older adult Hispanic males. Early vascular intervention is critical to prevent amputation and improve his quality of life  given that CLI is a severe form of PAD and is a major risk factor for lower extremity amputation. Discussing smoking cessation  a diet plan  exercise schedule  and regular medications for diabetes and hypertension to improve his overall health should be part of his management plan.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,61,Patient Information:   The patient  Mr. Singh  is a 72-year-old Indian male  residing in New Delhi  who presented with signs of critical limb ischemia. He is married with two adult children  and is a retired engineer.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Singh has a documented history of type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago  which is controlled by medication. He also has hypertension  which he has grappled with for 10 years  and high cholesterol levels diagnosed 8 years ago.   He occasionally drinks alcohol and is a former smoker  having quit smoking 20 years ago  but had consumed approximately 15 cigarettes a day for almost 30 years prior to quitting.  He had a pacemaker implanted 5 years ago due to diagnosed congestive heart failure.  Primary Complaint:  Recently  Mr. Singh has been complaining about ongoing leg pain  which worsens at night  with noticeable localized swelling  sores  and ulcers that take a long time to heal and have discoloring around them. Mr. Singh mentioned that the pain is sometimes so severe that it interrupts his sleep and keeps him from participating in his daily activities  particularly his routine evening walks.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 68 because of myocardial infarction  and his mother died at the age of 77 due to complications related to Alzheimer’s disease. His elder brother  currently 75  has been living with coronary artery disease for the last few years. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease.   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  his pulses in the affected limb were faint. His skin temperature on the affected limb was cool to touch. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test was conducted and the results demonstrated severe arterial disease. Further  imaging tests showed the presence of significant plaque buildup blocking the blood flow to the legs.  Diagnosis:  Based on clinical findings  past medical history  and overall health status  the patient has been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Plan:  Immediate steps have been taken to control the pain and initial line of treatment includes medications to prevent clot formation and surgical interventions for revascularization. Moreover  educating the patient about the importance of foot care  maintaining a healthy cholesterol level  and sugar control would be part of the long-term management plan to delay the progression of the disease. Considering his chronic conditions and age  an inter-departmental collaborative approach would be necessary for holistic patient management.   Follow-up:   Mr. Singh is scheduled for a follow-up in 2 weeks to evaluate the progress of the treatment and accordingly plan further interventions. Telephonic follow-ups will also be conducted. He was also advised on possible complications and immediate red flags to look for  which would warrant urgent medical attention.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,62,Presentation: Mr. James McCall  a 68-year-old African American male  was admitted to our facility with severe pain in his right leg  which had been progressively worsening over the past week. He has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  based on history  clinical presentation  and investigations.  History: Mr. McCall has a detailed history of uncontrolled hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. A 30 pack-year ex-smoker  he quit smoking 5 years earlier but had been actively smoking for 25 years in the past. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and peripheral artery disease  which is consistent with literature showing that African Americans are disproportionately affected by peripheral artery disease and are likely to have higher limb amputation rates due to delayed presentation of CLI.  Examination: On admission  physical examination revealed that his right lower leg was pale  cold to touch  with sluggish capillary refill. Bullae and dry gangrene were present on his foot. His right dorsal pedal and posterior tibial pulses were absent. He has significant resting pain  which is relieved only if his foot is hung off the side of the bed.  Investigations: Vascular studies  including arterial duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography  confirmed the decreased flow in the right lower limb. Elevated fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels were also indicative of his uncontrolled diabetes.  Family History: His mother  who died aged 70  had a long history of type-2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease. His elder brother  aged 74  also has a history of type-2 diabetes and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery two years ago.   Management and Prognosis: Mr. McCall was immediately started on insulin therapy. Statins were added to control his hyperlipidemia. Painkillers were also prescribed for symptomatic relief. Unfortunately  due to the extensive gangrene  he had to undergo an above-knee amputation on his right leg. He has a high risk for cardiovascular disease and needs aggressive management of his modifiable risk factors and regular follow-up.  Conclusion: Mr. McCall is a classic case of an individual with multiple vascular risk factors. These  along with his race  previous history  and late presentation of CLI  all compounded to his current poor prognosis. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,63,Patient Information: A 68-year-old African American male  John D.  presented to the clinic.   Chief Complaint: John complained of experiencing severe pain in his right lower leg at rest for the past two weeks. Notably  he also reported having a noticeable wound on his leg that hasn't healed for a month.   Medical History: John was diagnosed with type-II diabetes 20 years ago  which he reported was poorly controlled. His diabetes was complicated by diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. He has been taking regular medication for diabetes and adheres to a restricted diet. His blood pressure records have shown occasional increases  and he was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago. John also reported that he’s been an active smoker  with a smoking history extending over the past 30 years.  Examination: Physical examination revealed coldness in his lower extremities  particularly to his right leg where a non-healing wound approximately two inches in diameter was noted on his foot's dorsum. His right foot also showed gangrenous changes. His pedal pulses were absent in his right limb. Furthermore  the right leg showed signs of poor nutrition and atrophy.  Investigations: An Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) was performed promptly  which was less than 0.4  indicating very poor perfusion. Duplex ultrasound and contrast angiography confirmed severe occlusion in the lower peripheral arteries. Biochemical blood tests revealed elevated HbA1c levels indicating poor diabetes control.  Diagnosis: Based on John's symptoms  investigations  and clinical examination  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  likely due to his long-standing smoking habit  uncontrolled diabetes  and hypertension.  Family History: There is a relevant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had coronary artery disease and passed away from a heart attack. However  no limb ischemia or peripheral artery disease were reported in the family.   Prognosis and Management: Given John’s recent diagnosis  the main goal is to restore blood flow to the affected extremity and control his diabetes and hypertension. Following specialist consultation  John will undergo revascularization likely by angioplasty. He will be referred to an endocrinologist for better glycemic control and a vascular surgeon for wound care.   John will also undertake lifestyle modifications  including nutrition counseling for diabetes management  smoking cessation  and regular exercise. Furthermore  he will be scheduled for regular follow-ups to track his progress and manage complications.  This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the risk factors for CLI  particularly among African American males with uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and a significant smoking history. The diagnosis and management require a comprehensive  multidisciplinary approach.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,64,Patient Presentation:  Patient Initials: R.S.  Sex: Male  Age: 67 years old  Race: White  Demographics:  R.S. is a 67-year-old white male from a suburban locality. He is a retired teacher who lives with his wife. He has a history of smoking for the past 30 years  but quit 5 years ago.   Past Medical History:  R.S. has a significant medical history of hypertension  controlled with medication  type 2 diabetes mellitus  chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)  and high cholesterol. He also underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery ten years ago.   Family History:  His father died at the age of 72 of a heart attack  while his mother passed away at the age of 78 due to complications from stroke. His older brother  currently 70 years old  is living with cardiovascular disease and also had a CABG surgery.   Chief Complaint:  R.S. presents with complaints of severe pain in his left lower leg  especially at rest. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his left foot and toes that have been worsening over the past few weeks.  Diagnosis:  After evaluation  which included a physical examination  ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement  Doppler ultrasound  and angiography  R.S. was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Discussion:  Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe obstruction of the arteries which notably reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.   This diagnosis was reached considering R.S.'s history of peripheral vascular disease risk factors (e.g.  age  smoking history  diabetes  high cholesterol  and family history of cardiovascular disease) and the severity of his symptoms. His non-healing ulcers and severe rest pain are typical of CLI.   Plan:  The treatment plan includes both medical management and invasive procedures. R.S should continue his medication for diabetes and hypertension  and start taking antiplatelet and statin drugs to reduce the artery-clogging process and prevent blood clots. Also  he would benefit from a revascularization procedure like angioplasty  stent placement or bypass surgery given his severe symptoms.   The patient would also need lifestyle modification education which includes a structured exercise program and foot care to prevent further complications. Regular follow-up appointments are needed to monitor progress  and a possible referral to a vascular surgeon or an interventional radiologist if his condition worsens.   In conclusion  R.S.'s case is a typical presentation of CLI and he needs aggressive management to improve his prognosis and quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,65,Patient Presentation  We present the case of a 67-year-old African American male with a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Studies have demonstrated an increased prevalence of peripheral arterial disease  leading to critical limb ischemia  among African-Americans compared to other ethnic groups.  Patient’s Medical History and Demographics  The patient  Mr. John  hails from a low-income neighborhood  is a widower  and lives alone. He was referred by his local clinic with complaints of chronic foot ulcers  excruciating pain in his left foot  especially at night and a recently noticed intermittent limp while walking. With a considerable history of 30 years of smoking  obesity (body mass index 31 kg/m2)  and more than ten years of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes  Mr. John was identified as a high-risk patient for cardiovascular problems. Furthermore  he had hypertension and a record of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) three years ago.  Mr. John's medical history includes persistent hyperglycemia  hyperlipidemia  a HbA1c level of 8.2% despite taking Metformin  and a high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level despite on statins. Besides  he has been on antiplatelet therapy (low-dose aspirin) due to his past TIA condition.  Family History  Mr. John's family has a significant history of heart disease and type-2 diabetes. His father died of a myocardial infarction in his early 50s  and his older sister also has diabetes and had a bypass surgery for coronary artery disease. His 72-year-old brother was recently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease.  Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis  The clinical examination revealed weak distal pulses in the left foot and ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.45 in the left foot  well below the normal value  indicative of severe ischemia. Doppler ultrasound revealed significant stenosis and occlusions in the left peripheral arteries. After confirming the diagnosis with angiography  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia based on his symptoms  ABI value  and imaging results.  This case presentation of Mr. John with CLI emphasizes the need for early detection and management of risk factors. It also highlights the potential role of socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic disparities in vascular disease management and outcomes. This pressing issue necessitates further research and interventions targeted at reducing these disparities and improving the overall health outcomes of high-risk populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,66,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male  married  retired maintenance engineer  living in an urban area with his wife.  Past Medical History: He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history  he quit 20 years ago. He has a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that has been managed for the last 15 years through oral hypoglycemic and lifestyle modifications. Additionally  he is diagnosed with Hypertension for the past 20 years and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) for the last five years. He maintains his hypertension with daily antihypertensive medications.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 64. His mother  who is now 93 years old  has been living with chronic heart failure and hypertension for several years. He has one sibling  a brother  who died at 55 due to a stroke.   Present Condition: The patient presents with a two-week history of rest pain in the right lower extremity. There is a noticeable decrease in mobility due to the constant discomfort. He has non-healing ulcers on his right foot along with noticeable muscle atrophy in his right calf. This suggests hemo-dynamic significant stenosis of the iliac and/or infra-inguinal vessels which are classic signs of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) presenting as severe peripheral arterial disease.  Social History: The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement. Diet history includes high fat and processed foods with his attempts to eat more fruits and veggies. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He has a checkered compliance history with his diabetic medications and often fails to follow a disciplined schedule.   Diagnostic Tests: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test reveals an index < 0.4  consistent with severe disease. Duplex ultrasound confirmed the calcified plaque in both right tibial and peroneal arteries. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) showed severe multilevel peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the right lower extremity.   Treatment: Seeing the negative impact on his quality of life and the complexities of the situation  including the patient's history and ethnic predisposition  immediate intervention in the form of revascularization is planned. He will require aggressive risk factor modification  rigorous glycemic control  an overhaul in his diet  and potentially Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET) following the procedure.   Follow-up care includes wound care specialists for his non-healing ulcer  a potential statin therapy  ASA antiplatelet therapy and the possibility of a future prostaglandin E1 analog  and a regular dietitian consult for better diabetes management. He would also benefit from increased social support to aid in medication compliance. A multi-disciplinary team will be involved throughout his treatment and recovery to optimize patient outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,67,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old male  reasonably well-preserved for his age. He presented with progressive pain and progressive weakness over the past six to eight weeks  primarily localized in his left lower limb. He indicates a non-healing wound on his lower leg.  Patient Demographics:  The patient is of Hispanic ethnicity  considering several studies indicate that critical limb ischemia is more prevalent in Hispanic and African American communities compared to Caucasians. He is a former truck driver  lives alone  and is currently retired. He is a widower with two adult children  both living out of state. He is a nonsmoker and non-alcoholic.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  which he takes medications for  given the prevalence of these conditions in cases of critical limb ischemia. Diabetes has been poorly controlled  with recent hemoglobin A1C values consistently over 9%. He also has a history of atherosclerotic heart disease with a heart bypass surgery performed 12 years back.  Family Medical History:  The patient's family history is significant for type 2 diabetes  heart diseases  and hypertension. His mother and father both died of heart disease-related complications. His only brother also has diabetes and recently underwent an amputation due to critical limb ischemia.  Clinical Findings:  Clinical examination revealed a pale  pulseless left lower limb with an ulcer over his lower third limb. A palpable femoral pulse was absent. There was no sensory perception detected below the knee level. On contrast  the right lower limb showed slightly diminished but present distal pulses and full limb sensation.  Management and Treatment Plan:  The patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery for consultation  given his critical limb ischemia. He was admitted to the hospital for the initiation of intravenous heparin and aggressive wound care with concomitant management of his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia by the primary care team and endocrinologist.  The highly coordinated multidisciplinary approach was used for this patient. Surgical evaluation by a vascular surgeon included angiograms for further diagnostic study. Long-term plans of revascularization procedures  hyperbaric oxygen therapy  or even potential amputation  depending on the nature and severity of his case  were discussed. Regular follow up with his primary care provider  vascular surgeon  and endocrinologist is key to managing his condition and preventing further complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,68,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Auto Mechanic   Past Medical History: Diagnosed with chronic hypertension for 10 years  controlled with calcium channel blockers. Shows signs of long-term nicotine and alcohol use but claims to have quit both 5 years ago. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for the last 7 years  managed with insulin. No known history of cancer. No known allergies.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Doe presented with persistent left foot pain with walking  which worsened over the past weeks. His pain is relieved by rest but recurs upon resuming activity (claudication). He's experienced rest pain and non-healing ulcers on the left foot. Physical examination reveals coldness  paleness  and reduced pulses in the left foot.   Family History: John's father had a history of vascular disease and passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 72. His mother lived till 78 years and succumbed to stroke. His older brother is living with coronary artery disease.  Social History: Mr. Doe is a widower living alone with occasional assistance from his son and daughter-in-law. He used to smoke one pack of cigarettes per day for over 40 years but quit 5 years ago. Mr. Doe used to be a social drinker but quit alcohol 5 years ago. They deny any use of recreational drugs.  Diagnosis: After considering Mr. Doe's medical history  presenting symptoms  and findings from the physical examination  we suspect critical limb ischemia (CLI). For confirmation  we'll be conducting additional diagnostic tests  including an ankle-brachial index  ultrasound  CT angiography  or catheter angiography as needed.  Plan: If CLI is confirmed  a consultation with a vascular surgeon will be done. An appropriate revascularization approach (angioplasty with or without stenting  or bypass surgery) will be recommended based on the patient's overall health status  age  nature of the vascular disease  and extending life expectancy. Taking into account the patient's presenting symptoms  history of hypertension and diabetes  a comprehensive plan for managing these comorbidities will be updated. Patient lifestyle modification including dietary guidelines and exercise will be mandatory.  Informed consent will be required from the patient after all the potential benefits  risks  and alternatives have been discussed with him. Follow-ups will be advised as per the post-treatment care regimen.   Reasoning: Considering Mr. Doe's age  ethnicity  history of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes  he falls into a high-risk category for peripheral artery disease  a common cause of critical limb ischemia. His symptoms  such as ischemic rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and reduced pulses in the affected limb  are consistent with a presentation of CLI. As critical limb ischemia is a severe condition that can lead to amputation if untreated  immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,69,Patient Information:   A 78-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  and resident of an urban community in New York. He is a non-smoker  but has a history of hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus Type II  high cholesterol  and obesity. He is widowed  lives alone  and has two adult children.   Presenting Complaint:   The patient complains of severe pain in his right lower leg  especially when walking. He also notes that his foot feels cold to touch and appears pale.  Medical History:   His medical history shows that he has been diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago  which is currently being managed with medication (Lisinopril and Amlodipine). The patient has been on oral medication (Metformin) for his Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 7 years. He is also on a statin (Rosuvastatin) for hyperlipidemia. The patient reports that he tries to maintain a healthy diet but struggles with weight control.  Physical Examination:   Physical assessment revealed an ulcer on the right heel  reduced pulses  and a cold pale foot. The patient scored 3 on the pain scale at rest  which increased to 9 during walking. His BMI was calculated to be 32  suggesting obesity. Blood pressure was measured at 140/90mmHg  with random blood sugar spikes up to 200mg/dL.   Investigations:   Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed a significant reduction in blood flow to his right lower leg. Further vascular studies (CT angiogram) revealed extensive blockage in arteries of the affected lower extremity. His HbA1c was 7.2  indicating sub-optimal blood glucose control. Lipid profile depicted elevated LDL cholesterol levels.  Diagnosis:  Critical Limb Ischaemia of the right lower extremity was diagnosed  secondary to peripheral artery disease  likely exacerbated by his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.   Treatment and Management:  The patient was scheduled for revascularization surgery to restore blood flow. His hypertension medicine was adjusted  given his blood pressure levels. Glycemic control was stressed upon  with possible Insulin initiation considering his A1c and random blood sugar levels.   Family History:  His father died from a myocardial infarction  and his mother had a stroke. His older brother was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). Both of his children are healthy.  Discussion:  African-American males have a higher risk to develop PAD and Critical Limb Ischaemia. This patient’s risk is elevated due to his personal medical history  especially diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol. His lifestyle and family history further increase these risks. This case reinforces the importance of lifestyle interventions and rigorous management of these risk factors in preventing the development and progression of PAD and subsequent Critical Limb Ischaemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,70,Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 70   Demographics: The patient is a retired African American factory worker. He is married with three children and lives in an urban setting. His socioeconomic status is currently low-middle class.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with diabetes 10 years prior and has been managing it with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet modifications. His hypertension was diagnosed two years ago and is currently managed with ACE inhibitors.  Presenting Illness: The patient presented to the clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower limb  especially at night. Additionally  he noticed ulcerations on his right foot that showed no signs of healing  and an apparent discoloration of the limb.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Upon assessment  there were no palpable pulses in the patient's right lower limb. Diagnostic tests  including Doppler ultrasonography and ankle-brachial index (ABI)  were conducted. Results confirmed a significant reduction in blood flow  consistent with critical limb ischemia.   Family History: On inquiry about family medical history  it was revealed that his father had peripheral artery disease and eventually died from myocardial infarction.  Social History: The patient has been a smoker for the past 35 years  he consumes alcohol occasionally but does not abuse substances. He lives with his wife and experiences a lot of stress due to financial constraints after retirement.  Management: Given his critical limb ischemia  the patient was referred for angiography  with a view to possible revascularization. He will also need optimization of blood pressure and glycemic controls  wound care for his foot ulcerations  and counseling for smoking cessation. If revascularization is not possible  the patient may require a partial or complete limb amputation to prevent systemic infection.  Summary: The 70-year-old African American male patient's diagnosis of critical limb ischemia likely stems from cumulative risk factors including his race  socioeconomic status  smoking history  poorly controlled hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His future management will require a multi-faceted approach including control of comorbid conditions  potential surgical interventions  and lifestyle modifications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,71,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jackson  a 70-year-old African-American male  presented to the Emergency Department with severe constant pain on his left lower leg. He reports lethargy  having sustained marked weight loss  and has experienced intermittent claudication for the past few years. This pain has been progressively worsening over the last three months  inhibiting his mobility significantly. It has now reached a point where it handles even while at rest. He also described a sore on the leg that hasn’t healed for more than 2 weeks.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Jackson has a history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and kidney disease being managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  anti-hypertensives  and statins. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 45 years. His BMI is currently 28 and he has been struggling with obesity for most of his life. He does not engage in physical activities due to his chronic pain.   Family History:   Men in his family have a history of cardiovascular diseases and his father passed away from a heart attack at 63 years old. His mother  aged 80  has diabetes and suffers from chronic kidney disease. His elder brother (75 years) also has a history of heart disease and a younger sister (68 years) who has hypertension and obesity.   Diagnosis and Discussion:  After running several tests  Mr. Jackson was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia due to advanced peripheral artery disease. His long-standing smoking history  presence of multiple systemic diseases including diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and heart disease (common in his family) are noted as significant risk factors contributing to his condition.   Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously decreases blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers  sores or gangrene.   Treatment:  As Mr. Jackson is presenting late-stage symptoms  he may need revascularization procedures (angioplasty  stent or bypass surgery) depending on the severity and blockage site within the artery. With the advanced kidney disease  the choice of procedure will also be influenced. He will need to have a strict management plan for his diabetes and will be advised to quit smoking and control his BMI through dietary changes and  when possible  moderate physical activity.   A holistic approach has been planned to look into his psychosocial well-being too. He will be recommended to a dietitian and physical therapist for his weight management. Furthermore  a psychological assessment has been suggested considering his chronic state.   Educational discussions about his condition and the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation  healthy diet  physical activity regularly) are stressed as they are crucial in the management and prognosis of his condition.   Regular follow-ups have been planned with vascular surgery  cardiology  nephrology  dietetics  endocrinology  and a wound care specialist for his sore on leg. Above all  the compliance of the patient in tackling his lifestyle choices and mutual trust between him and his healthcare provider are integral to his treatment's success.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,72,Patient Profile: Mr. R is a 67-year-old African-American male living in an urban setting. He comes from a lower socio-economic group and has been a regular smoker for the past 35 years. He is widowed  lives alone  and occasionally stays with his oldest daughter who has a family of her own. Mr. R is a retired manual laborer and has limited health literacy.   Past Medical History: He has an extensive medical history that includes hypertension  diabetes mellitus type-II for the past 15 years (poorly controlled)  hyperlipidemia  and a past history of mild stroke with no residual neurological defects. He had minor surgery 10 years ago for an inguinal hernia repair. His medications include amlodipine 10mg daily for hypertension  Metformin 1000mg twice daily  and atorvastatin 20mg once daily. His BMI is 30.5  indicating obesity.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. R was referred to the vascular clinic by his primary care physician with a 6-month history of rest pain in his right leg. The pain is increasing in severity and disturbs his sleep. The pain is associated with intermittent claudication that occurs after walking barely half a block  significantly interfering with his daily living activities.   Examination and Diagnosis: Physical examination reveals absent pulses distal to the femoral pulse in his right lower extremity. The skin of his right foot appears dusky with loss of hair. There is also a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. His left leg demonstrates palpable distal pulses with no evidence of skin changes or ulcers. Assessment of vibratory and monofilament sensation reveal decreased sensation over the toes of both feet  more pronounced on the right.  Investigation findings including ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.4 on the right and 0.9 on the left  with further differentiation of lesion site by Duplex Ultrasonography reveals multiple arterial stenotic lesions at his femoral and popliteal arteries. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) confirms these findings.  Mr. R was diagnosed with right lower extremity Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) largely due to atherosclerosis secondary to his long-standing smoking habit  poorly managed diabetes  and hypertension.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at a young age  and his mother had a stroke at an advanced age. Two of his brothers also have Type-II diabetes and hypertension. His oldest daughter  aged 44  was recently diagnosed with hypertension.  Plan: A multi-disciplinary approach involving a vascular surgeon  diabetologist  dietitian  and physiotherapist is needed in Mr. R's management. Treatment options including endovascular revascularization  bypass grafting  or  if not feasible due to his general condition  amputation of the affected limb should be discussed. Concurrently  efforts should be made to correct the modifiable risk factors  such as improving glycemic control  hypertension  adopting a healthy lifestyle including cessation of smoking  regular exercise  and balanced diet to prevent disease progression. It's also advisable for his immediate family members to get screened for diabetes and hypertension given their significant family history.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,73,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Demographics: This is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with critical limb ischemia  presenting with rest pain and tissue loss in the lower extremit1ies. He is a retired construction worker  lives alone and is a widower with no children. He has history of smoking  but quit 8 years ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral vascular disease  for which he had a previous angioplasty 10 years ago. He does not have any history of coronary artery disease or stroke. He has had chronic kidney disease stage 3 for the past five years.  Presenting complaints: The patient typically experiences pain in his right leg when he walks more than one block and during rest  over the last 6 weeks  leading to sleeplessness. There is also a non-healing ulcer on his right heel since 1 month  with no signs of infection.  Family History: Father and paternal uncle had history of peripheral arterial disease. His mother had diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Sister diagnosed with coronary artery disease in her late 50s.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a thin elderly man in no acute distress. right foot is pale and cool to the touch with diminished pulses. The ankle brachial index (ABI) showed decrease in ratio indicating poor circulation. Ulcer present on right heel with black eschar. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Pertinent Laboratory results: HbA1C was 8.2%  Creatinine was 2.3 mg/dL  total cholesterol was 210 mg/dl  LDL was 160 mg/dl  and HDL was 40 mg/dl.  Impression: This patient with history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia and smoking has critical limb ischemia  likely due to progression of peripheral vascular disease with resultant rest pain and tissue loss  Plan: Urgent vascular surgery consultation has been ordered for a planned angiogram and consideration for revascularization. Pain management is handled with opioids. Wound care team has been engaged for managing ulcer. His uncontrolled diabetes and dyslipidemia management is intensified with insulin and high potency statins.  This case portrays the average patient diagnosed with critical limb ischemia and the various factors such as old age  a history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  and a family history of peripheral arterial disease contributing to its development and progression.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,74,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old African American male presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of pain at rest in his right leg. He also stated the presence of non-healing sores in the toes of the same foot. The patient reported the pain had been intensifying over the past few weeks  becoming particularly severe during the night  waking him up.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Both conditions are under control with oral medications  metformin 1000 mg twice daily  and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago and was on Aspirin 81 mg daily. He is a smoker with a 50-pack-year history and has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.1 kg/m2  indicating obesity.  Demographics:  Data from the literature shows that critical limb ischemia (CLI) is commonly found in older adults  typically 50+ years  and it is slightly more prevalent in males. In the US  CLI is more common in African American patients. Risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes mellitus  and smoking are highly associated with CLI. Our patient falls into this demographic category and risk profile.  Family history:  The patient revealed that his father had a history of coronary artery disease and had passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His older brother  now 72  had a leg amputation due to peripheral arterial disease complications. No family history of stroke or other significant cardiovascular diseases was noted.  Physical Examination and Relevant Findings:  On examination  the skin of the right lower extremity appeared shiny with noticeable hair loss. There was an ulcer on one of his toes  and another wound was starting to form. His lower leg showed signs of cyanosis  particularly when raised. The pedal pulses were very weak and barely palpable. Temperatures of the two legs were notably different  the right one being significantly cooler.  Assessment/Discussion:  It appears that the patient's longstanding diabetes and uncontrolled smoking habit have contributed to this present condition. Given the clinical presentation and past medical history  a working diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made  possibly an advanced stage of his known peripheral artery disease.  The non-healing ulcers and rest pain fit into Rutherford's classification for limb ischemia—specifically between grade 2-3 or category 4-5 demonstrating the severity of limb threat. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and intervention as required. This case teaches us about the severe complication of PAD  which is CLI  and the importance of educating patients about risk factor control  particularly smoking cessation and good glycemic control  to prevent or delay its progression. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,75,Patient Presentation:  Gender: Male  Age: 70 years  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired miner  Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the right lower leg at rest  ulcerations on the right foot.  Medical History: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus controlled by oral medication (Metformin) for the past 10 years. He also has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and is a former heavy smoker  having quit five years ago. His last check-up was six months ago.  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at age 72 and brother had a stroke at age 67. His mother died of lung cancer at age 76.   Physical Examination: Patient is afebrile but in evident discomfort. Right lower leg is pale  cool to touch  and shows cyanosis on elevation. There are non-healing  painless ulcers on the right foot  focused particularly on the toe and heel.  Investigations & Diagnosis: Ankle brachial index (0.34)  Doppler ultrasound  and subsequent angiography confirmed diagnoses of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  complicated by right foot skin ulcerations. The blood tests show poorly controlled diabetes and dyslipidemia.  Treatment: The patient was started on optimal medical treatment  including statins  antiplatelet  and antihypertensives. He was taken for revascularization through balloon angioplasty  and follow-up care included wound care with eventual minor amputation of necrotic tissue.  Prognosis: Given the patient's moderate to high risk of mortality within the next 5 years  due to related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases  the focus is on improving his quality of life  keeping him ambulatory  and avoiding major amputation.  Follow-up: The patient will need intense follow-up in terms of wound management  controlling blood sugar level  lipid profile  blood pressure  and ensuring smoking cessation. A referral was made for diabetic counselling to understand nutritional needs  and physical therapy for mobility strengthening was also planned. His lower limb will need to be monitored for further ulcerations or development of gangrene signs.  This case reflects CLI common scenarios  with risk factors including old age  a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia  all representative of a significant portion of patients diagnosed with CLI. The strong family history of cardiovascular diseases further highlights the genetic predisposition of such conditions. Holistic management  including stringent care of underlying conditions and lifestyle changes  are essential in this case.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,76,Patient Information: Mr. A is a 72-year-old African American male  retired military officer  residing in a low-income area in North Carolina. He is married and has three adult children. According to the CDC and various clinical studies  the demographic factors (age  sex  race) correlate significantly with increased risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and subsequently critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Past Medical History: Mr. A has had a long-standing history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 20 years ago  and hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery 7 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He also has a known allergy to Penicillin  causing rashes.    Family History: His mother had a history of peripheral vascular disease and succumbed to a stroke. His father had coronary artery disease and died due to myocardial infarction. This inherited predisposition could have contributed to his current state of health.  Social History: Mr. A has a 40 pack-year history of smoking. Despite multiple attempts  he has failed to quit smoking. His weekly alcohol consumption is mild  and he denies any illicit drug use. He has been on a controlled diet plan due to diabetes and has no regular exercise routine.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. A complains of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot for the past two months  associated with rest pain and tingling sensation on the same foot  which worsens at night  causing sleep disturbance. He also complains of noticeable color and temperature changes in his feet.   Clinical Examination: Physical examination revealed cold extremities  pallor and marked decreased pulses in the right foot. A marginal ulcer was noted along with mild edema.   Clinical Investigations: The laboratory investigation revealed HbA1c of 8.0% and uncontrolled blood pressure (150/95 mm Hg)  indicating poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was conducted  and it was critically low indicating severe blockage. A Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenosis in the right lower limb arteries.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and investigation results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD) was made.  Treatment Protocol: Conservative treatment with aggressive blood glucose control  blood pressure regulation  cholesterol lowering medications  and pain medicines was initiated. Patient was counseled for smoking cessation. Revascularization was taken into consideration  to treat blocked arteries either by angioplasty or bypass surgery. The patient was also referred to a wound care specialist for the non-healing foot ulcer.  GIVEN THE ABOVE  future medical check-ups will be focused on monitoring his response to the implemented treatment protocol. A multidisciplinary approach will be continued  aiming to prevent further complications related to CLI and improve Mr. A's quality of life. This case reminds us of the impact of race  socioeconomic class  and medical non-compliance on the course of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,77,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old African American male from a lower socio-economic background  presented to the vascular surgery outpatient clinic with complaints of severe and continuous pain in his right leg  persistent even during rest.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has been a controlled hypertensive and diabetic for the past 20 years. His hypertension is managed with diuretics and ACE inhibitors  while his diabetes is type II and managed via oral hypoglycemic agents. Patient has a BMI of 32 (obesity class I)  is a former tobacco smoker (quit 3 years ago  >40 pack history)  and is also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease since 5 years. There is no history of any heart disease. He undergoes regular follow-ups for his conditions but has poor overall medication compliance.  Family History: There is a significant family history of heart disease and stroke. His father experienced a myocardial infarction at age 62. His mother has uncontrolled type II diabetes  and his older brother died from ischemic stroke at 60 years.  Presenting Complaint: On clinical examination  his right leg was observed to be cooler than his left with diminished  though palpable  distal pulses  dark wounds/ulcers on distal phalanges of right foot. These symptoms were indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Diagnostic Findings: 1. Ankle-brachial index (ABI): The ABI test results were 0.3. 2. Angiography: This was performed revealing significant occlusions in his right popliteal artery and three tibial arteries.   Management and Treatment Plan: Mr. Doe was informed of the urgency of his condition  the need for revascularization  and the probability of amputation if interventions were refused or unsuccessful.   Follow-up: Adjunctive care  including control of his modifiable risk factors (diabetes  hypertension  smoking cessation maintenance  and weight loss)  compliance to medications (antiplatelets  statins  and pain relief)  wound care management  and scheduled regular visits for monitoring  were emphasized.  This brief case highlights the fact that CLI often found in elderly  African American men with chronic comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension  especially remaining unmanaged. Increased awareness and frequent screening of high-risk individuals  along with immediate attention to indicative symptoms  are argued for in the literature to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CLI. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,78,"Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. A Age: 65 years  Sex: Male Race: African American  Residence: Urban residing  Southern California  Presenting complaints: Mr. A came in with complaints of rest pain and non-healing ulcers in the right lower limb for six months.  Past Medical History: Mr. A is a known case of symptomatic peripheral artery disease diagnosed five years ago. His other significant medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last ten years  hypertension for the past seven years  and a smoking habit for 30 years. He received a pacemaker for atrial fibrillation four years ago. Hypothyroidism was well-controlled on medication. He underwent another angiography two years ago that showed a significant progression of peripheral artery disease.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and his mother was diabetic. He has a brother who is hypertensive.  Examination details: Physical examination revealed coolness of the right leg along with the presence of non-healing ulcers over the right great toe and adjacent dorsal aspect of the foot. His right side dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable.   Laboratory investigations: Laboratory investigations revealed a HbA1C of 8.8% indicating poor diabetic control. Other hematology and biochemistry parameters were within normal limits. Doppler study of the lower limb showed reduced ankle brachial index <0.4 on the right side.  Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical examination  and preliminary investigations  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made.  Patient's condition: His condition is complex due to the presence of several comorbidity factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and history of a cardiac condition  which aggravate the risk and severity of critical limb ischemia. His smoking habits further contribute to the probability of disease progression.  Plan: The plan involves immediate optimization of underlying conditions. He was advised to quit smoking. His diabetic and hypertensive control was reassessed  and medications were titrated accordingly. Foot care was emphasized. Pain control was initiated with opioids and an urgent vascular surgical consultation was sought given the severity of symptoms and risk of limb loss.  In context to demographics  it is noteworthy that black racial status increases the risk of peripheral artery disease  which is a significant contributor to the development of critical limb ischemia. Aging is another significant risk factor. Importantly  Mr. A's case is typical and representative considering his age  race  and existence of several risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  and smoking.  Literature support: According to an article on Critical Limb Ischemia published in """"Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy""""  an estimate of about 2 million people in the United States have CLI  and its prevalence is more common among elderly males  especially among African Americans  smokers  diabetics and hypertensive individuals."
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,79,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. John Doe. Age: 65 years old. Gender: Male. Race: Caucasian. Occupation: Retired construction worker.  History: Mr. Doe presented at the clinic with persistent lower left leg pain. The pain especially increases at night and is relieved slightly by hanging his leg off the edge of the bed. He has also reported loss of hair on his left leg and foot  change in skin color  coldness of the foot and erectile dysfunction. He mentioned a history of intermittent claudication that has worsened over the last 6 months to a point where he finds it hard to walk short distances.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a 10-year history of Type II Diabetes and hypertension. He has been on insulin and anti-hypertensive medication since his diagnosis. He was also diagnosed with high cholesterol five years ago and is currently on statin therapy. Mr. Doe has been a heavy smoker for the last 30 years. He has a family history of peripheral artery disease  with his father having had a below-knee amputation due to the same condition.  Physical Examination and Test results: On examination  there were no palpable pedal pulses on his left foot. The left foot appeared pale and shiny  with non-healing ulcers on his toes. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test score of 0.4  further confirmed the significant arterial blockage. Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) was ordered and revealed a complete blockage in the left Popliteal artery with minor blockage in the right Popliteal artery.   Diagnosis: Based on clinical findings and investigations  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia of the left lower limb  primarily due to significantly compromised blood flow related to Peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Plan: Mr. Doe will be immediately admitted to the vascular department for possible angioplasty or bypass surgery. He will also be started on a combination of antithrombotic and lipid-lowering drugs  along with strict control of blood glucose and blood pressure. Smoking cessation will be strongly encouraged. In the worst-case scenario  if the limb cannot be salvaged  Mr. Doe might require amputation.  Prognosis: The prognosis will be determined based on his response to treatment. Given his family history and late presentation  his prognosis may be guarded. Research suggests that if Mr. Doe refrains from smoking and keeps his blood pressure  blood sugar  and cholesterol levels in check  he can potentially slow down the disease progress. However  his significant blockage might require a more aggressive approach. Multi-disciplinary care is crucial for improving his quality of life and limb salvage. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,80,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Washington is a 74-year-old African American female  residing in an urban neighborhood in Cleveland  Ohio. She lives alone in a senior living community and looks after herself with occasional assistance from her niece. She had retired 10 years ago as a school teacher. She is a widow  her husband passed away from prostate cancer  5 years ago. They had no children. She has never smoked nor consumed alcoholic beverages. She does not have travel history.  Medical History: She has a complex past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 30 years and hypertension for over 20 years. She was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and chronic renal disease stage III around 15 years ago. Her current medications include a daily dose of metformin  lisinopril  simvastatin  and furosemide.  Presenting Complaint: She presented in the emergency department complaining of severe pain in her right lower extremity  which she describes as  “My leg hurts a lot  especially at night and it feels really cold”. She also reported an active non-healing ulcer of 2 cm diameter in her right foot. She had noticed discoloration of her right foot which over time had become worse.   Family History: Her mother had a history of cerebrovascular accident at age 63 and died at the age of 77 due to cardiac arrest. Her father had a history of diabetes and hypertension  and died at the age of 82 due to renal failure. She has two siblings: a younger sister who is status post bilateral knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis and an older brother who died at age 68 due to lung cancer. None of her family members have had any peripheral vascular disease.  Differential Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presenting complaints  symptoms and clinical history  a differential diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)  and Diabetic Foot was considered.  Investigations: Her risk factors including the diabetic history  hypertension  advanced age and exam findings led to a working diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). An ABI score (Ankle-Brachial Index) was performed  which found to be less than 0.4 confirming CLI.  Treatment: She was admitted to the vascular surgery department where she was started on conservative management with analgesics  anticoagulants  optimization of her diabetes and hypertension control alongside wound care.  Summary: Ms. Washington is a complex patient having multiple comorbidities with poor socioeconomic state. As Critical Limb Ischemia has a poor prognosis  multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons  podiatrists  dietitians  endocrinologists  and cardiologists is being planned for her optimal care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,81,**Patient Profile**: 66-year-old African American male (studies suggest a fairly high prevalence among the African American population)  **Past Medical History**:  The patient  Mr. X is known to suffer from Type-2 diabetes and high blood pressure for the past 10 years. He is a long-term smoker  smoking approximately a pack a day for the last 35 years.  **Presenting Symptoms**:  Mr. X visited the ER with complaints of severe pain in his left leg (rest pain)  ulcers on his toes  and a significant decrease in mobility over the course of the last few weeks. He disclosed that the pain increased at night when he was lying flat and was less intense when he hung his leg over the edge of the bed or walked around a bit.  **Family History**:  His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at 70. The patient's mother  now 88  is alive  suffering from hypertension and arthritis. His brother  68  is a known diabetic.  **Examinations and Results**:  Physical examination revealed diminished pulses in the left leg  pallor on elevation  shiny atrophic skin  and non-healing ulcers on the toes. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  and the patient's ABI was found to be 0.35  significantly below the standard range which confirmed severe peripheral artery disease. Further duplex ultrasound imaging of the lower extremities revealed significantly reduced blood flow below the knee  more prominently in the left leg. A CT angiography confirmed severe blockage in the below-knee arteries and some areas of the above-knee arteries.  **Diagnosis**:  Based on his symptoms  ABI score  and CT findings  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  categorized as Rutherford Class 5.  **Social History**:  Mr. X is retired  lives with his wife  working part-time at a local grocery store. He has two daughters who live close by and visit them weekly. He enjoys fishing  watching sports  and cooking barbecue.  **Management Plan**:  Due to his critical condition  the patient is recommended for urgent revascularization to restore blood flow. He will be referred to a vascular surgeon to evaluate feasibility for endovascular treatment or bypass surgery. Further  his diabetes and hypertension will be managed aggressively with medication and lifestyle modifications  which would include smoking cessation  a low-sodium diet  and physical therapy post-revascularization surgery.  **Prognosis**:  CLI is a serious condition that  if not treated promptly and effectively  may result in amputation or even mortality. Mr. X’s prognosis heavily depends on his ability to undergo successful revascularization therapy  control his diabetes and hypertension  and cease smoking.  *Note: This presentation is a fictional account  not meant to portray a singular or general truth about critical limb ischemia or its demographical spread.*
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,82,Patient Information:  Mr. Raj Kumar  a 75-year-old Asian male  retired professor from New Delhi  India  currently residing with his son and his family in the United States.  Presenting Complaint:  Progressive pain in his lower extremities  particularly the right foot. The pain has persisted for the past 5 weeks and is more severe while he's walking or at rest in the night. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his right toes  for which he sought medical attention.  Past Medical History:  Diagnosis of Type II diabetes mellitus 13 years ago  currently being managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He is also suffering from chronic hypertension and dyslipidemia - both managed with medication for the past 10 years. He has previously undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for coronary artery disease 8 years ago. He is a former smoker who quit smoking 15 years back but had a history of 20 pack-years.   Family History: His mother also had a history of diabetes and his father had succumbed to a myocardial infarction. His elder brother was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which led to amputation of one of his legs  while his younger sister is currently managing Type II diabetes mellitus.  Clinical Assessment: Physical examination depicted dry skin  decreased hair growth and thickened nails in right foot. Foot pulses were not palpable  and capillary refill time was prolonged. Doppler ultrasound showed monophasic flow suggestive of severe arterial insufficiency. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) came out to be 0.3 in the right lower limb  suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The poor healing ulcers on the toes and the indications from the investigations pointed towards a diagnosis of CLI.  Management Plan: Given his co-morbid condition  progress of the disease  cardiovascular risk  and the severity of the limb ischemia  a multidisciplinary approach was adopted. The plan included rigorous metabolic control  cessation of tobacco (though he quit smoking 15 years back  passive exposure due to family members smoking at home might impact the condition)  and statins for dyslipidemia. He was put on a regimen of antiplatelet medications to prevent clotting. Pain management was achieved by use of analgesics. Consultation with an interventional radiologist for possible revascularization either surgical or via angioplasty/stenting was considered. Moreover  dedicated wound management was initiated for his non-healing ulcers. Further  advice was given to his family members to minimize his passive smoke exposure at home. Appropriate referrals were made concerning his current health status.  Long-term Prognosis: Raj's long-term prognosis must include aggressive monitoring and control of blood glucose  blood pressure  and cholesterol  as these risk factors contribute to the progression of CLI. He will require regular follow-ups to ensure the optimal working of his treatment plan and to promptly address any arising complications.   Informed Consent: Raj was informed about his diagnosis  the implications  its impact  the potential for disease progression  and the plan moving forward. Together with his son  they acknowledged and consented to the treatment plan.  References: 1. Norgren L  Hiatt WR  Dormandy JA  Nehler MR  Harris KA  Fowkes FG.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,83,Patient Diagnosis: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 75 years old  Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired School Teacher Residential area: Urban  in a retirement community  Medical History: Mrs. Doe is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago. She has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with medication  and hypercholesterolemia. She has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2016.  Family History: The patient's father and elder brother had both experienced late-onset vascular complications  which led to cardiovascular disease. Her mother died at age 83 due to complications from diabetes. She has no siblings with similar conditions  although her son has hypertension.   Presenting Complaint and Relevant Information: Mrs. Doe presents with a six-month history of rest pain in the lower right leg  which has intensified over the last two months. She reports difficulty in walking short distances and notes severe pain at night. The pain is typically relieved by hanging her leg over the side of the bed. Mrs. Doe now finds communication difficult due to decreased mobility  consistent with a dramatic decline in her quality of life. She has tried over-the-counter pain medication based on her family physician's suggestion  but it provided little relief for her symptoms.   Examination reveals a pale  cold  and pulseless right foot with a non-healing ulcer on her right great toe. There is no evidence of injury or recent trauma. Extensive pallor was noted during the elevation of the limb with dependent rubor (a reddish-blue discolouration of the limb when hanging down).  Summary: Considering her pre-existing conditions of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypercholesterolemia  and her previous cardiac history  Mrs. Doe's presentation is suggestive of a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   This case is representative as patients with CLI are commonly older  have multiple comorbidities  including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases  and may have a history of smoking. As appropriate demographic representation shows  critical limb ischemia is more prevalent among elderly patients  particularly over 70 years old  more common in women  and impacts Caucasians disproportionately.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,84,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged African American Male with Diabetes  Patient Presentation: Mr. Franklin  a 57-year-old African American male from Washington  DC  has presented with a three-week history of non-healing ulcers on his left foot accompanied by severe burning pain increased at night and when his foot is at rest. He also reports a loss of sensation in his left foot and difficulty walking due to pain. His BMI registers at 33  categorizing him within the obese range.  Past Medical History: Mr. Franklin has a history of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes diagnosed at 35 years old  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack per year history but quit ten years ago.   Family History:  His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; his father suffered from peripheral artery disease (PAD) and had a non-fatal stroke at 60 years old. He also lost an uncle from coronary artery disease in his early 50s.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  his left foot appears dusky and cool to the touch. There are multiple non-healing ulcers on his foot  the largest being an approximately 3cm diameter ulcer on his heel with surrounding erythema. Distal pulses (Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) are absent on the left foot.  Diagnostic Assessment:  He underwent an ankle-brachial index test  which yielded a result of less than 0.4 on his left foot  indicating severe arterial insufficiency. Subsequent Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenosis in the below-knee arteries. A complete blood count revealed his HbA1c is 8.6%  indicating poor long-term control of his diabetes.  Current Medication: He is presently taking metformin for diabetes  atenolol for hypertension  and atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia.  Plan: Mr. Franklin’s combination of clinical presentation  examination and investigations lead to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease  most likely exacerbated by his diabetes  smoking history  obesity  and hypertension. He is referred to a vascular surgeon for consultation. Control of his risk factors is emphasized  especially stricter glycemic control. Given the severity of limb ischemia and the size of his foot ulcer  revascularization procedures may be considered to prevent limb loss.  Conclusion: CLI is a severe condition that must be treated urgently to prevent limb amputation. Risk factors such as ethnicity  diabetes  smoking  obesity  and hypertension should be managed appropriately to prevent the progression of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate vascular consult can facilitate limb salvage and improve prognosis.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,85,Patient Presentation: Mr. M is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who was referred to the vascular team with a five-month history of rest pain in his right foot  particularly at night. Mr. M reports the pain is severe enough to interrupt his sleep and forces him to hang his leg over the side of the bed for relief. He has been unable to walk due to the pain  which has significantly impaired his quality of life.  Past Medical History: Mr. M's medical history is significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and two pack/day smoking history of 40 years. He quit smoking three years ago when he was diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He has no history of alcohol or drug use. His medications include a daily dose of atorvastatin and Metoprolol  plus Spiriva and Combivent for his COPD.  Family History: His family history is significant for peripheral artery disease (PAD). His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother was diagnosed with PAD  amputated at the age of 65. He has two brothers  both of whom have been diagnosed with cardiovascular conditions.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. M had a palpable femoral pulse but non-palpable pedal pulses bilaterally. His right foot was notably colder than his left  with visible signs of atrophy  skin discoloration  mottling  and absence of hair. There are no signs of ulceration or gangrene. His Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was 0.3.  Investigations: He underwent a CT angiogram which demonstrated severe infrapopliteal occlusive disease. Both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries were occluded through their entire course  and there was evidence of reconstitution of the dorsal pedal artery at the ankle via collaterals.  Diagnosis: Based on his clinical presentation  ABI  and CT angiogram results  Mr. M was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  Management: Given Mr. M's notable comorbidities  poor vascular formation  and the extensive nature of the blockage  the patient was not a suitable candidate for revascularization. A robust pain management plan was implemented  and Mr. M was educated on foot care and the importance of regular outpatient follow-up.   Prognosis: The prognosis for this patient highlights potential risks including non-healing wounds  infection  amputation  and PAD-associated cardiovascular events.   This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and management of critical limb ischemia to help prevent grave complications. Regular check-ups will be essential for Mr. M to ensure proper monitoring of his condition. This can improve his quality of life and potentially prevent further complications.   We can conclude that reducing cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and effectively controlling other comorbidities are fundamental elements in the management of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,86,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Jackson is a 68-year-old African American male from an urban setting who was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. He has been retired for the past 3 years and was previously employed in a local car assembly plant. Mr. Jackson is a father of 3 and a grandfather of 6. He is a widower and he currently lives alone  although he gets regular visits from his eldest daughter who helps with his care. The patient's socioeconomic status is low to middle-class.   Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He has a documented past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension over the past decade and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 6 years. He was also diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 4 years ago  which is now complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient also has high cholesterol and a body mass index of 30  classifying him as obese.  Family History:  His mother had hypertension and died from a myocardial infarction at age 82  while his father lived with type 2 diabetes and passed away from complications at the age of 79. His eldest brother  72  had a stroke last year  and his younger sister  65  is also diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension.  Presentation and Diagnosis:  Mr. Jackson sought medical attention presenting symptoms of severe rest pain in the lower legs. He described the sensation as numbness and coldness in his feet and toes  particularly during night-time. Additionally  he expressed a noticeable decrease in mobility  specifically in relation to walking. Physical examination revealed non-healing wounds on his lower limbs  particularly on his left foot  and absent pulses in both lower extremities  thus leading to the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   Angiograms further emphasized significant blockages in the arteries of his lower extremities  in line with the diagnosis. He presents an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) of less than 0.4  characteristic of CLI. Laboratory investigations indicated poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c of 9.2%) and hypertension (Blood Pressure of 160/95 mm Hg).  Relevance to Literature:  According to literature  Mr. Jackson's demographic representation fits the major risk factors for developing CLI including old age  being African American  hypertension  diabetes  smoking  obesity  and high cholesterol. CLI primarily affects older adults  particularly those over the age of 60  and is typically associated with lower socio-economic status. Furthermore  the prognosis and the chosen treatment plan for Mr. Jackson is influenced heavily by his comorbid conditions—his uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.    A multidimensional approach would be required for Mr. Jackson including aggressive control of his glycemic levels  hypertension and lipid levels  guidance for smoking cessation  micro nutrition  wound care management  and most likely  a revascularization procedure taking his overall health into consideration. Mr. Jackson represents a typical CLI patient where a proper personalized and balanced approach would be essential to control the disease progression and enhance his quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,87,Patient Presentation  Patient Details:  Mr. A is a 72-year-old Caucasian male from a rural area presenting with a six-month history of chronic progressive and incapacitating pain in his left lower limb. He also reports intermittent claudication  ulceration  and gangrenous changes in the toes.   Past Medical History:  Patient is a known case of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago. Other past medical history includes hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and a smoking habit of 40 pack-years  which he quit five years ago. He has no known allergies.   Family History:  Family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases as his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his elder brother underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at 70.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed pallor  diminished pulses on the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery  alongside a non-healing ulcer on the big toe. His resting ankle-brachial index was 0.4  indicating severe arterial insufficiency.  Investigation Findings:  A comprehensive duplex ultrasound identified non-compressible calcified arteries and severe stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery. His blood results indicated an uncontrolled diabetic status with HbA1c of 9.4%  apart from a mildly raised lipid profile.   Treatment and Outcome:  Considering his age  uncontrolled diabetes  the extent of arterial stenosis  and severe limb ischemia  surgical intervention was risky. Collaborative discussions with vascular surgeons  endocrinologists  and interventional cardiologists resulted in a decision to proceed with angioplasty and stenting. Meanwhile  the patient was put on optimal medical management  including aggressive control of hyperglycemia  lipid-lowering drugs  pain management  wound care  and low-dose aspirin.   Conclusion: Mr. A continues to attend weekly outpatient wound-care visits  demonstrating substantial improvement. This case underlines the importance of a multidimensional approach in managing critical limb ischemia  keeping in consideration the cardiovascular risk factors  ensuring aggressive control of diabetes  and promoting smoking cessation initiatives for improved patient outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,88,Patient Profile: The patient  an African-American male aged 75  a retired construction worker  presents with severe pain in his left leg. He resides in a semi-rural area and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  consuming almost a pack a day for 25 years  although he quit some 15 years back.   Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension  managed with medication for the past two decades. His blood pressure currently is well-controlled; recent measurements average 130/78 mmHg. The patient was diagnosed with Type-II diabetes 10 years back  currently managed with metformin and a controlled diet plan. The most recent HbA1C value (3 months prior) was 7.2%. The patient also had coronary artery disease  treated with percutaneous coronary intervention five years ago. No history of any neurologic or pulmonary diseases.  Family History: The patient's father died from a myocardial infarction at age 82. His mother died of stroke at age 78. He has two siblings  a brother who is still alive with a known history of high cholesterol  and a sister who died from breast cancer.  Presenting symptoms and findings: The patient complains of excruciating pain in his left leg  particularly when he walks but also at rest. He notices that his foot is cold to touch and looks pale. These symptoms started gradually several months prior but have intensified over the last two weeks. The initial physical examination confirms diminished pulses in the affected limb along with notable pallor and coldness.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  history  and physical examination  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is tentatively made. This condition  often found in individuals with peripheral artery disease  is a severe obstruction of the arteries. CLI prevalence is higher in diabetics  smokers  or hypertensive individuals. This diagnosis was confirmed with an Ankle-Brachial Index test  followed by an angiogram.  Treatment and Management:  The patient is referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and treatment. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms  revascularization (either by surgery or angioplasty) is likely indicated. The focus will also be on managing the patient's cardiovascular risk factors  such as maintaining control of his diabetes and hypertension and ensuring that he remains non-smoking. It will also be emphasized the importance of regular exercise and a balanced diet in managing his condition.  Summary: This case highlights the necessity of prompt identification and management of CLI  especially in African American male patients who are older and have comorbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and a history of tobacco use. Public health efforts should focus on educating high-risk communities about the causes  symptoms  and treatments of this serious condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,89,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 69-year-old African American man by the name of Mr. Elliott who resides in Brooklyn  New York. He's retired from his job as a bus driver. He is a widower with two adult children. He has a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 31  indicating obesity. Mr. Elliott is a former smoker  having quit approximately 30 years ago following a 20-year habit of one pack a day.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Elliott has a history of type II diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago and hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. Both conditions are generally managed well with medication  though there have been fluctuations in blood pressure levels and HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) over the years. Five years ago  he underwent PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) for stable angina. He also took medication for high cholesterol  titrating statin levels for optimal LDL and HDL balance. There is no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. He has intermittent claudication for the past two years.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Elliott presented with escalating pain in the lower left extremity  especially in the heel area at rest  and there was a noted ulcer on the great toe of the same foot. Patient notices that the pain tends to decrease when he hangs his leg off the side of the bed. He reported diminished strength in the limb and reduced mobility. He reports the ulcer on his toe has been there for over a month and is not healing despite topical treatments.  Family History:  Mr. Elliott’s father had a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and died at the age of 72 due to myocardial infarction. His mother had hypertension and type II diabetes and died at the age 78 due to stroke. His older brother  age 72  was diagnosed with PAD two years ago.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis:  Physical examination revealed decreased peripheral pulses in the left foot. Ulcer on the left great toe showed signs of infection. Ankle-brachial index was significantly decreased and angiography confirmed severe stenosis in the lower extremity  leading to a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Plan:   As a result  Mr. Elliott was referred to the vascular surgery team for possible revascularization. He was also prescribed prophylactic antibiotics for his foot ulcer to prevent further infection. A comprehensive plan for tight blood glucose and blood pressure management was also reinforced. Furthermore  he was referred to a dietitian to work on weight management and nutrition. Smoking cessation was not an issue for Mr. Elliott  but was noted as crucial for others with similar health profiles.   This case represents common risk factors and presentation for critical limb ischemia including a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol  obesity  and a family history of PAD and cardiovascular diseases.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,90,Patient Profile -------------------- •   Name: Mrs. Maria Dominguez •   Age: 68 years •   Gender: Female •   Occupation: Retired teacher •   Ethnicity: Hispanic •   Residence: Urban Texas  U.S.  Case Presentation ------------------------- Mrs. Maria Dominguez  a 68-year-old retired Hispanic teacher  was referred to the vascular clinic with severe rest pain  intermittent claudication  and a non-healing ulcer on her right foot for the past three months. She also reported of experiencing pain while at rest and increasingly dependent on analgesics.   Past Medical History --------------------------- Mrs. Dominguez was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago and had been well-managed on a regimen of metformin and lifestyle modifications since then. She had also been diagnosed with high blood pressure 5 years ago for which she's taking lisinopril. She quit smoking 10 years ago.  Family History ------------------------ There is a strong familial history of cardiovascular disease. Her father died due to a heart attack at 65  and a paternal uncle had undergone lower limb amputation due to his uncontrolled diabetes.  Investigations --------------------- Pulses in the patient’s right foot were significantly diminished. Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was 0.45 in her right foot and 0.78 in her left foot. Duplex ultrasound and CT angiography revealed multi-level tibial arterial disease with approximately 90% stenosis of her right common femoral artery and occlusion of her popliteal artery. Her left leg showed 70% stenosis of her popliteal artery. Her blood glucose level was slightly raised  and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) indicated poor long-term glucose control.  Diagnosis ------------------- From the above clinical presentation and investigations  the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in the right foot due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) secondary to her diabetes was made.  Treatment and Outcome -------------------------------- She underwent successful bypass surgery of her right common femoral artery. Subsequently  aggressive risk factor management  including advising her on dietary changes  intensifying physiotherapy  and optimizing her hyperglycemic control was done. Since CLI is a chronic condition  long-term follow-up will be necessary to assess for disease progression and to manage new symptoms that may emerge.  Conclusion ------------------- This case emphasizes the importance of vigilant monitoring in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  as these conditions significantly increase the risk of developing CLI. Prompt recognition  aggressive treatment  and consistent follow-up can improve outcomes in these patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,91,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: A 68-year-old African American female presents with severe  continuous  and progressive rest pain involving her left lower extremity  particularly the distal foot. Symptoms have been ongoing for three months  characterized by sudden sharp pains and a burning sensation  increasing at night.  Demographics: Place of Residence: Urban Area Occupation: Retired Schoolteacher Marital Status: Widowed Education Level: Bachelor's Degree Insurance: Medicare  Medical History: She has a past medical history significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 25 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She also has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit five years ago. Her surgical history is clear  with no past surgical procedures.  Family History: Her family history shows a parental history of cardiovascular diseases (her father died from myocardial infarction  and her mother had a stroke). Her older siblings also had documented cases of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease.  Clinical Findings: On evaluation  her vitals were stable. However  physical examination revealed marked decrease in the temperature of her left lower limb  absence of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the left side  and foot ulcerations with signs of necrosis. No significant neurologic deficit was found.  Diagnostic Assessments: Due to the severity of her symptoms and her risk factor profile  a vascular surgeon ordered additional testing. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) showed a reading of 0.3 for the left lower limb signifying severe arterial disease. Meanwhile  a duplex ultrasound suggested multi-level disease with an occlusion in left external iliac artery and significant stenosis in femoral artery. Podiatry consultation confirmed the suspicion of critical limb ischemia.  Treatment Plan: The patient was started on analgesics for symptom control along with optimal foot care. Endovascular therapy is considered for revascularization  and she may require further pharmacotherapy with antiplatelets  statins  and antihypertensive medications. Nutritional supplementation and rehabilitation therapy would be significant parts of her care program.  Future Outlook: The patient’s outlook depends on the adequate control and management of her diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Smoking cessation must be reinforced. She will be closely monitored for symptom control and limb salvage  as the disease introduces a high risk for amputation and cardiovascular events.  Case Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early detection and ongoing screening in patients with type 2 diabetes  especially those with additional risk factors of long-term tobacco use  hyperlipidemia  or hypertension  and a family history of cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,92,Case Presentation  Background Information: Patient Initials: J.B  Age: 75 years old Sex: Male  Race/Ethnicity: African American (Statistically  African Americans are at high risk of critical limb ischemia)  Chief Complaint: Chronic wounds in lower limbs; Severe pain in the feet and calf muscles (particularly when walking or climbing stairs).  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  all of which have been managed with medication for the past 15 years. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit ten years ago.  Family History:  Father had a stroke in his 70s  mother died of heart disease. Two of his three siblings have hypertension and one has type 2 diabetes.  Lifestyle: Retired construction worker  minimal physical activity since retirement  diet high in processed foods and saturated fats.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  lower extremities showed dry skin  discoloration  hair loss  cold to touch  weak pulses  and non-healing ulcers on the feet. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) test revealed an ABI of 0.4 in the right leg and 0.45 in the left leg (An ABI score less than 0.9 is usually indicative of peripheral artery disease and CLI). An angiogram further highlighted significant blockage in both lower limbs.  Diagnosis: Given the evidence of poor circulation  prolonged healing times  and his medical history  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Management Plan: The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation. Conservative management included medications for pain (Gabapentin)  blood thinners (Aspirin)  and cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins to slow disease progression. Lifestyle counseling was conducted with a focus on a low cholesterol diet. The diabetic educator reviewed proper foot care. The patient was also referred to a nutritionist for proper diet education and a physical therapist for a graduated walking program. An interventional radiologist inserted a balloon catheter to widen the artery and improve blood flow (balloon angioplasty). A stent was also placed to keep the artery open.  Follow Up: The patient was requested to maintain regular follow up with the vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  nutritionist  and the physical therapist at designated intervals for monitoring progress and managing complications.  *Remember  this is a fictitious case scenario and specific details may differ depending on the individual circumstances of the patient.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,93,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: John Smith is a 70-year-old African American male who visited the hospital with complaints of rest pain in his right lower limb  non-healing ulcer  and skin discoloration  a syndrome now known as critical limb ischemia (CLI). Literature suggests that CLI incidence is higher in African Americans and male gender  owing to risk factors like smoking and diabetes linked with demographic and lifestyle aspects.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a medical history significant for chronic diseases. He has been a Type 2 diabetic for 15 years now  with inconsistent control over his blood sugar. Additionally  he is hypertensive and has been under medication for the past 10 years.  He smoked for approximately 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He is also being treated for moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  both attributed substantially to his past smoking habit. He has a history of two mild heart attacks in the past decade.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a massive heart attack at the age of 72 and one of his brothers suffers from coronary artery disease. However  there's no known hereditary disease in the family.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed  revealing an ABI of 0.6 indicating severe peripheral arterial disease. Duplex ultrasound revealed significant stenosis in his right leg. His right foot is pale  cold with an ulcer on the heel  and intermittent claudication was observed.  Diagnosis: Considering his history  physical examination findings  and diagnostic tests  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His diabetes  smoking history  and hypertension are considered significant risk factors for developing this condition. Plus  his ethnicity and male gender also contribute to an increased risk.  Treatment and Prognosis:  A comprehensive treatment plan has been established  which includes strict control of his glucose and blood pressure levels  quitting smoking  and medications to improve blood flow. In addition  angioplasty is being considered to restore blood flow in the lower limb. Amputation is the last resort but can be avoided with prompt intervention and proper care.  CLI represents the end stage of PAD  and without treatment  prognosis can be poor; half of the untreated patients may require amputation  and mortality rates are significantly high within a year of diagnosis. However  with optimal risk-factor management and appropriate intervention  we aim to achieve limb salvage and improve Mr. Smith's quality of life.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,94,Patient Presentation  We will discuss the case of Mr. Paul Anderson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male patient with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Given this disease's predominance in patients over 60 and a higher prevalence in men  our patient's demographics are in line with the epidemiological data.   Medical History  Mr. Anderson is a retired local truck driver with a 30-year history of type II diabetes mellitus and a 40-pack/year history of smoking. As we know  his smoking is a significant risk factor for peripheral artery disease  a common cause of CLI  and poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk. He also has moderate hypertension and history of mild intermittent claudication  for which he was prescribed appropriate medication.  Presenting Symptoms   He presented to the Interventional Radiology clinic with a one-year history of intense rest pain in the left lower limb  not relieved by medication. It usually peaked at night  disturbing his sleep. Additionally  there were non-healing ulcers on his left foot. His pain score was marked as 9 on a visual analog scale of 0-10.  Family History   No significant family history was documented. Both of his parents lived into their late 80s and died of non-cardiovascular issues. Although he has three siblings  none have cardiovascular disorders.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis   Physical examination revealed dry  discolored skin on the left foot with ulcerations on the heel and toes. Palpation found no pulses below the knee. Angiography confirmed severe stenosis in the distal left superficial femoral artery and three infrapopliteal arteries. A Doppler ultrasound registered reduced ankle-brachial pressure indices. Combined with his symptoms and risk factors  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  In conclusion  Mr. Anderson is a typical candidate for CLI given his underlying comorbidities (diabetes  hypertension  and smoking)  age  and gender. His presentation  clinical findings  and diagnostic tests further validate the diagnosis. His care will require an immediate management plan for limb salvage and pain management  coupled with aggressive control of his risk factors.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,95,Patient Case Presentation:  Demographics: Mr. James Arthur  a 58-year-old African American male  who has been a lifelong resident of Houston  Texas.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Arthur comes to the emergency room with increasing pain  coldness  and numbness in his left lower leg that has been worsening over the past few months. Recently  he has noticed skin discoloration and nearly continuous pain  even while at rest.  Past Medical History: Mr. Arthur was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and has struggled to maintain consistent glucose control due to intermittent compliance with medications and diet regimens. He has a 10-year history of hypertension and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  but he has been non-compliant with medications and follow-ups due to financial constraints. Other relevant medical history includes his being a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history.  Family History: Both his mother and father had type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his mother passed away due to stroke at 68.  Social History: Mr. Arthur had been an equipment technician in an oil company for 30 years but has now been unemployed for the last 2 years. He smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day and admits to moderate alcohol consumption. He is divorced but has three grown-up children.  Physical Examination: On examination  he is found to have a weak pulse in the affect limb  cold and pale skin  and minor ulcers on the foot. There is significant atrophy of the leg muscles. His Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is 0.5 which is indicative of severe peripheral artery insufficiency.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood workup reveals high glucose levels. An arterial Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The vascular surgeon recommends angiography to further visualize the arterial occlusion.  This case study spotlights a patient at high risk for CLI given his race  age  extensive smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  non-compliance to medications  peripheral artery disease  and family history of cardiovascular disease  which are all well-documented risk factors in medical literature. It is important that Mr. Arthur's treatment plan include aggressive modification of his risk factors  along with revascularization procedures  to restore blood flow to his leg and prevent amputation. His plan should also include intensive glycemic control and cessation of smoking  as well as frequent follow-ups with his healthcare team.   This case underscores the need for improved patient education and compliance  particularly in those individuals who are at high risk for vascular disease  such as Mr. Arthur.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,96,Patient Presentation:   The patient  Mr. A  is a 70-year-old African-American male from an urban community presenting with severe rest pain in his right lower limb  particularly in the foot. He describes the pain as excruciating  preventing him from sleeping at night. Upon physical examination  the foot appears pale with a noticeable lack of a palpable pulse  suggesting poor peripheral circulation.   Past Medical History:   Mr. A has a significant past medical history  including hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which he has been managing with oral medication for the last 15 years. He also has a history of smoking one pack a day for the past 50 years  contributing significantly to his vascular disease. He was diagnosed with intermittent claudication and peripheral artery disease (PAD) five years ago.  Family History:   His father died at the age of 62 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 79. He has a 67-year-old brother with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an older sister with diabetes and hypertension. Both siblings are alive.  Lifestyle:  He is a retired mechanic  now leading a sedentary lifestyle. Mr. A admits to a diet high in fast food and consumes alcohol socially but denies substance abuse. He lacks sufficient physical activity  which  when considering his unhealthy diet  contributes to obesity.  Examination:  His BMI is 30.2. His blood pressure is 170/85  and blood sugar levels are elevated. Upon examination  his right foot was cool to the touch with evidence of atrophic skin  absence of hair growth  and brittle nails. The absence of pedal and posterior tibial pulse was noted. Mr. A shows signs of chronic ulceration on his heel.  Diagnostic Imaging and Lab Values:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was done showing a value of less than 0.5 on the right. Duplex ultrasound shows a significant reduction in blood flow in the right lower extremity. Labs indicate HbA1c of 8.5%  LDL of 160 mg/dL  and Creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL.  Diagnosis and Management:  Mr. A was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia  the advanced stage of PAD  characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene. His options include medication  angioplasty  surgery (aortoiliac  femoropopliteal  or infrapopliteal reconstruction or bypass)  or amputation. For Mr. A  the initial step is optimal medical therapy  including blood sugar regulation  antiplatelet  and cholesterol-reducing drugs  encouraging lifestyle modifications (quitting smoking  exercise). If this fails or his condition worsens  intervention strategies can be revisited.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,97,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient: Mr. James Lopez Age: 71 Race: Caucasian Gender: Male Residence: Boston  Massachusetts  Presenting Problem: Critically ischemic left lower limb   Past Medical History: Mr. Lopez has been treated for high blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol for the past 20 years. Diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  maintained under control with medication and diet modification. His BMI is 27.3kg/m2  indicating a slightly overweight status. No history of surgeries  no allergies reported.   Smoking History: Mr. Lopez smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit 15 years ago.  Family History: Father died of a heart attack at the age of 73. The mother lived until 81 and succumbed to complications from Alzheimer's disease. His older brother  currently aged 76  was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) two years ago.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Lopez presented with severe pain in the left lower limb especially during walking  an area of non-healing ulcers on the left foot and reported occasional episodes of numbness over the past few months.  Physical Examination: Noted pallor in the left foot with weak pulses. The left foot was significantly cooler than the right. Non-healing ulcerated areas noted over the great toe and heel.  Workup: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed and showed significant discrepancies between the two legs (Left: 0.4  Right: 0.9). Subsequent peripheral angiography confirmed severe stenosis of the left femoral artery and popliteal artery. Labs showed elevated levels of HbA1c (7.8)  suggesting poor glucose control in recent months.  Diagnosis: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to advanced Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).  Comments: Mr. Lopez's CLI appears to be a result of his long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and poor glycemic control. His history of cigarette smoking  along with familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease  likely accelerated the progression of PAD to this critical stage. Management should involve a multidisciplinary approach to construct a plan for suitable revascularization  optimize diabetes control  manage lipids  halt the progression of ischemia  and ultimately  salvage the limb.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,98,Patient Profile:  Mr. Thomas J  a 64-year-old African-American male  attended the clinic for severe pain  non-healing ulcers  and gangrenous changes reported in his left lower limb. He resides in a small town in South Carolina  employed as a warehouse worker  and has a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM).  Presenting Complaints:  He was referred by his general practitioner following progressive leg discomfort exacerbated by walking  known as intermittent claudication  and pain at rest  especially at night.   Past Medical History (PMH): He has a 15-year history of ill-managed DM and hypertension. Additionally  he had been smoking a pack and a half per day for the last 40 years. Five years ago  he underwent a stent placement for coronary artery disease (CAD).  Family History:  Mr. Thomas's father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 66  and his mother had Type 2 DM and passed away due to chronic kidney disease complications. His older brother was recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Examination:  Physical examination revealed absent pulses in the left lower extremity and coldness to touch. He had a non-healing ulcer on his left foot with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.5  confirming severe blood flow obstruction.  Investigations: Diagnostic angiography showed significant multiple tibial and peroneal artery occlusions. He was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of PAD  likely precipitated by poorly managed DM  hypertension  smoking  and a familial predisposition.  Treatment plan: Given the severity of the situation  he was scheduled for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. He was prescribed an antihypertensive  a statin  and an antiplatelet drug. He was counseled about the gravity of his condition  the importance of aggressive risk factor management  especially quitting smoking  and tight control of his DM and hypertension.   Follow-Up: He was referred to a dietician and a diabetic nurse for better management of DM. Outpatient wound care and monthly follow-ups were arranged for ulcer management  assessing the effectiveness of the intervention  and early identification of any complication.  This case highlights the importance of strong primary care  routine screening  and aggressive management of risk factors in patients with a high risk to prevent progression to CLI  a grave and costly problem that often results in major amputation or death. It also reinforces the fact that minority populations  particularly Black Americans  are disproportionately affected by PAD and its complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,9,99,Patient Case Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. G is a 68-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  who hails from New Jersey. He is a widower and lives with his elder daughter and his grandchildren. He arrived at the ER presenting with severe rest pain in the right lower limb  difficulty in walking  and a non-healing ulcer at the distal part of the right leg.  Past Medical History: Mr. G has a history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Hyperlipidemia. His diabetes has been under control and stable on oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a 25-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day and mild alcohol consumption.  Family History: Upon enquiring about family history  he mentions his father passed away post a stroke at the age of 75 and his mother had a history of diabetes. His sibling  an older sister  is fit and well. But he lost a younger brother to sudden cardiac death at 55.   Clinical Findings and Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  there is a notable decrease in right lower limb temperature compared to the contralateral limb. The right pedal pulse is not palpable and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is noted to be 0.3 on the right side. An ulcer measuring 3x6 cm with necrotic tissue in the distal right leg is observed.   Based on the presentation  past medical history  clinical findings  and diagnostic tests  Mr. G is diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Discussion: Critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries  generally affects the elderly and is more prevalent among males and in people over 50 years of age. The diagnosis of CLI  in this case  is confirmed by severe pain and the non-healing ulcer on Mr. G's foot.  The risk factors contributing to his CLI would be his smoking history (heavily implicated in peripheral artery disease)  uncontrolled hypertension and lipid levels  diabetes  and also his genetic predisposition indicated by his family history.  Management and Follow-Up: Mr. G will require wound debridement for his ulcer  aggressive control of his modifiable risk factors  possible revascularization through surgical or endovascular techniques  and pain control. Long term follow-up will involve medical therapy and continued surveillance for disease progression  lifestyle modification  and a smoking cessation program. His family should be informed of the severity of the situation and the possibility of future complications  including amputation  if the condition doesn't improve and he continues his current lifestyle behaviors.   His advance care wishes should also be explored given that CLI generally has a poor prognosis  with 1-year mortality rates reported as high as 25%. Future appointments should also discuss the management of his other comorbidities  as attention to managing diabetes and blood pressure can significantly impact the progress and prognosis of CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,9,100,PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS: Patient's Initials: JD Age: 78 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Location: Rural Ohio   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient  JD  has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed with oral hypoglycemics and diet for 15 years. He is also hypertensive on ACE inhibitors the last 10 years. There were episodes of intermittent claudication about five years ago  and he is a former smoker who quit about 15 years ago. He is-allergic to penicillin.  FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's father died from a myocardial infarction in his late 70s  and the mother died from cerebrovascular accident in her late 80s. He has two daughters who are alive and relatively well. There is no known family history of peripheral artery disease.  PRESENTING COMPLAINT: JD presents to the clinic during a follow-up consultation complaining of intense  unrelenting bilateral lower limb pain at rest and non-healing ulcers on his feet  especially his right foot's big toe.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon examination  JD's lower extremities were found to be cold to touch with weak bilateral pedal pulses. Skin changes were observed  including pallor  and hair loss. A non-healing ulcer about FOUR cm in diameter with a depth of TWO cm was identified on his right big toe. Muscle wasting was also observed.  DIAGNOSIS: Based on the patient's symptoms  physical examination  past medical history  and demographic factors—an elderly  male former smoker with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension were diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  TREATMENT PLAN: The treatment plan includes consultation with a vascular surgeon to evaluate the need for revascularization. JD was prescribed pain management  consisting of opioids for the management of rest pain. He was also referred to the diabetic foot care department for wound care management of the foot ulcer. He was reminded of the importance of strict glycemic control and hypertension management.  PROGNOSIS: Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe condition with a high risk of amputation and mortality if not promptly and appropriately managed. Nevertheless  with a tailored and aggressive treatment plan like JD's  the prognosis could potentially improve. However  JD's advance in age and the presence of comorbid conditions could potentially impact the disease's overall management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,1,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: The patient is Mr. Fergusson  a 65-year-old African American retired steelworker. He is a widower  lives alone in an urban community  and qualifies under the lower socioeconomic bracket.  Past Medical History: Mr. Fergusson has an extensive medical history including hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia for last 10 years. He quit smoking 5 years ago  but smoked a packet of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years. He also has a high-fat diet pattern and low physical activity levels.  Key Complaints: Mr. Fergusson visited the hospital complaining of recurring  severe pain in his right foot which worsens at night and often disturbs his sleep. He also noted that the foot turns pale and cold  and that the pain eases slightly when he hangs his foot over the edge of the bed. He has also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right heel for one month. Additionally  he mentioned difficulty in walking short distances due to pain in his right calf  forcing him to stop and rest frequently before resuming.  Physical Examination: On examination  the right foot displayed pallor  and the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable. The foot also appeared shiny with loss of hair and nails  and had an ulcer of 2cm diameter with blackened edges on the heel.  Notes: Given the patient's demographics and said symptoms  he is indicative of peripheral artery disease moving into a late-stage which is known as critical limb ischemia. This condition is commonly seen in the 60-80 age group  particularly in African Americans due to higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in this population. Smoking being a significant risk factor further aggravates this. Immediate attention to this condition is required to prevent further complications such as infections  gangrenes  or amputations.  Teaching Point: This case helps medical students recognize critical limb ischemia from symptoms such as rest pain  non-healing wounds or ulcers  along with absence of foot pulses. It will also assist in understanding the co-relation of risk factors like smoking  diabetes  hypertension  age  and certain ethnic backgrounds to peripheral artery disease leading to critical limb ischemia. Lastly  it points out the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of limb ischemia to prevent catastrophic outcomes. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,2,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  non-smoker  residing in an urban area.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) managed with metformin  hypertension controlled with lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin. He's had previous diagnoses of peripheral arterial disease for the past ten years. The patient also reports a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in fat and sodium.   Key Complaints: The patient presents with severe rest pain in his lower extremities  specifically in the calf of his right leg. The pain has been consistent  especially at night  for three weeks and is maintained even when the patient is at rest. The patient also reports non-healing ulcers on his right foot that appeared about four weeks ago. He describes the affected foot as feeling cold and numb  with a significant reduction in his ability to walk due to discomfort.   Positive Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient’s right foot was noticeably colder compared to the left. An ulcer was observed on the dorsal aspect of his right foot displaying signs of infection. Pulses in his right foot were weak and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was lower than usual  representing reduced blood flow. Additionally  capillary refill time was prolonged signifying impaired circulation to the limb.  Note to students: This case involves a patient experiencing critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood-flow to the extremities. This disease requires prompt medical attention due to its association with cardiovascular events and amputation incidence. Consider this patient’s history  demographics  and risk factors in your formulation of potential treatment strategies.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,3,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: • Patient Initials: M.S. • Age:   71 years old • Race: Caucasian  • Sex:  Male • Occupation: Retired construction worker  Medical History: M.S. has a past medical history marked by several comorbid conditions. He has been a smoker for the past 50 years  with an estimated pack-year history of 45. His history also reveals chronic Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) both diagnosed 15 years ago and poorly controlled. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 30.5 kg/m2  indicating obesity. He also has a record of high cholesterol for the past 10 years. M.S. underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 7 years ago due to coronary artery disease (CAD). He has a family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in his father  who had undergone an amputation. M.S. has minimal physical activity.  Presenting Issue: The patient presents with a complaint of increasing pain in his left lower limb  especially at night for the past two months. He reports that the pain sometimes wakes him up from sleep (rest pain). The pain seems to alleviate when he dangles his leg off the bed. Additionally  he mentions that the pain intensifies when he walks a certain length (claudication). He also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left foot. There's no history of any trauma.  Physical Examination: On examination  his left foot appears pale and cool to touch  with feeble pulses in left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries (suggestive of diminished circulation). A non-healing ulcer is noticed on his left big toe. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is found to be <0.4 on left side. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Based on the history and physical examination  a working diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia is made.   Note: This case is meant for teaching purposes. Investigation  differential diagnosis  treatment and complications need to be further expanded based on this case. The risk factors such as age  DM  HTN  smoking  obesity  CAD  family history of PAD  and sedentary lifestyle need to be highlighted. The signs indicating the severity of the condition like rest pain  presence of ulceration and ABI<0.4 should be emphasized. It can be further discussed how the management of this condition involves both medical and surgical intervention. Awareness regarding preventive measures should also be part of the curriculum.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,4,Patient Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  presents to the clinic.   Past Medical History: He has a significant history of smoking  consuming one pack per day over the past 40 years. Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  and both are under control with appropriate medication: lisinopril 20 mg for hypertension and metformin 500 mg twice per day for diabetes. Unfortunately  he has low medication compliance. He has no diagnosed history of coronary artery disease or heart failure but has not undergone cardiovascular examination recently. His father had peripheral artery disease (PAD) and died of myocardial infarction. His BMI is 28  indicating obesity.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez complains of significant discomfort in his left leg  which he characterizes as a severe  sharp pain that's rapidly worsening  especially at rest  preventing him from sleeping at night. He reports that his left foot feels unusually cold and appears pale. He mentions a nonhealing sore on his left heel  which has been present for the last month. He also notes that he has been feeling generally weak and tired over the last few months.   Mr. Rodriguez's case report is an example of a patient presentation for CLI. The symptoms include rest pain  non-healing wound  and distal limb coldness  associated with his background of being a smoker  older age  and having hypertension  diabetes  and obesity  which are all common risk factors for CLI. A family history of PAD  low medication compliance  and lack of recent cardiovascular examination further amplify his risk. His ethnicity  Hispanic  is often underrepresented in medical studies but faces a similar risk to Caucasians. This case study encourages students to think holistically and carefully about patient history  presentation  and socio-cultural factors while approaching vascular diseases like CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,5,Patient Information:  Mr. Thompson is a 72-year-old African American male with a considerable smoking history (40 pack-years). His permanent residence is in a rural area  often with limited healthcare access.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has been previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease (PAD). He further has hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a history of transient ischemic attacks. He has been inconsistently compliant with medication and missed his last few appointments  citing difficulties with transportation.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Thompson presents with a 3-week history of worsening pain in his right lower leg. He describes pain as severe  continuous  and increasingly disturbing his sleep. He adds the pain is relieved only partially by rest. Coupled with this  he reports noticing color changes to his foot (both rest pain and skin change are key signs of progression to critical limb ischemia). He has also experienced wounds on the same foot that seem to be slow to heal. In the past week  he reports some difficulty in walking as well due to the pain.  This case is effective for medical students to learn about critical limb ischemia since it highlights the key symptoms like non-healing wounds and severe persistent pain exacerbated by physical activity. It also helps underline the importance of comorbidities like smoking  diabetes  and PAD in these patients. In addition  it illustrates challenges faced by rural older adult populations in terms of access to health care and medication compliance. These factors often contribute to late presentations with advanced disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,6,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Ms. Sanchez  74-year-old Latina woman  Background: Ms. Sanchez is a retired school teacher  widowed with three grown children. She hails from a socio-economically disadvantaged background and lives alone. She is non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She relies on a limited income from Social Security.  Past medical history:  1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 20 years ago  poorly controlled due to social-economic factors impacting diet and medication adherence. 2. Hypertension - On treatment for the past 15 years 3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) - Diagnosed 5 years ago 4. History of mild Stroke - 3 years ago  since which she has been on low-dose aspirin.  Key Complaints:  Ms. Sanchez presents with a three-week history of severe pain in the lower left leg that has disturbed her sleep and daily activities. The pain is primarily at rest and accentuated at night. She also complains of non-healing sores on her left foot and ankle. She reports noticeable coldness in the affected foot and reduced mobility due to the pain  but no chest pain or breathlessness.  Key Physical Examination Findings:  • Pallor  decreased skin temperature  and evident muscle atrophy in the left lower limb. • Non-pedal pulses appreciation in lower left extremity. • Non-healing ulcers on the left foot and ankle with no signs of infection. • No evidence of congestive heart failure on cardiovascular exam.  Key Investigations:  • Fasting blood sugar  • Lipid profile  • Doppler ultrasound  • Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  • Angiography if deemed necessary  Case Discussion:  This case is designed to teach students about diagnosing and managing Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  with a focus on the importance of early identification and intervention. Ms. Sanchez's demographic fits the typical CLI patient: older adults with a history of diabetes  hypertension  and PAD. Her case emphasizes the need for thorough examination and necessary diagnostics as part of the management plan. It also addresses social determinants that might impact patient's health outcomes  such as economic status and living conditions.   Learning Objectives:  Upon completing this case study  students should be able to: 1. Recognize symptoms of CLI 2. Apply knowledge of risk factors and pathophysiology to guide the diagnostic process 3. Develop a comprehensive management plan for CLI 4. Understand the impact of social and economic factors on patient care.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,7,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Information: Name: Mrs. Agnes Baker Age: 72 years old Sex: Female Race: European American Occupation: Retired schoolteacher Location: Rural Midwest  USA  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension  managed with Losartan. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed through Metformin and diet. 3. Ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Baker has approached her primary care physician complaining of progressive  intense pain in her left leg specifically below the knee  that has been persisting for over a month. The pain is described as particularly severe at night  often causing sleep disturbances. She also described the pain worsening when she elevates her leg  but found some relief when depending her leg over the edge of her bed or whilst standing.  On further probing  Mrs. Baker mentioned that she had noticed a non-healing ulcer on her left foot that started as a small blister but has progressively grown larger and deeper over the last week. She also mentioned the skin on her left leg has been changing  notably becoming shiny and tight. She reported experiencing unintentional weight loss and declining ability to walk or exercise due to the discomfort.  Note: Population studies show critical limb ischemia (CLI) is more commonly found in individuals over 50  is proportionately higher in those with diabetes  hypertension  and a history of smoking. It is also seen in patients living in rural areas due to lower rates of screening for peripheral artery diseases and subsequent care. This patient represents these demographics  making the case study more accurate and representative of the real world CLI patient population.  Students should perceive the above complaints of rest pain  non-healing ulcer  and physical changes as red flags for CLI. The presence of cellular and tissue death signaled by the non-healing wound should increase clinical suspicion for severe peripheral arterial disease and the necessity for prompt intervention.   The other part of the problem is signs of systemic disease such as unintentional weight loss warrant further investigation into the patient’s overall health status and management of her diabetes and hypertension. This will help them understand how the body systems interact and address the need for a comprehensive treatment plan for CLI patients.   Ref:   - Teraa  M.  Conte  M. S.  Moll  F. L.  & Verhaar  M.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,8,Patient Information:   Name: Mr. John Ramos  70 years old  Hispanic male  Retired Construction Worker  lives with his wife and is moderately active.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Ramos has a known history of Diabetes Mellitus  type 2  which he has been managing for about two decades with oral antihyperglycemic agents. He is also hypertensive and is managing the condition with medication. He quit smoking 10 years ago but had smoked for over 20 years before quitting. He has previously undergone angioplasty and stenting for coronary artery disease. There is no known history of cancer  chronic liver disease  or chronic kidney disease.  Key complaints:  Mr. Ramos came to his primary healthcare physician with a three-week history of worsening pain in the lower half of his right leg  especially when walking  but also at rest. He mentioned having trouble walking even short distances due to the pain. There were no associated symptoms of fever or weight loss  but he did notice that his leg looked paler than usual and felt colder than his other leg. Moreover  Mr. Ramos complained that he is waking up at night due to a “burning” pain in his foot that is relieved by hanging his leg over the side of the bed.  From this description  it is apparent that Mr. Ramos  with his background history  is presenting with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia. This case can be used to discuss topics such as the aetiology  pathophysiology  clinical presentation  differential diagnosis  investigation  and management of critical limb ischemia  while also considering the various risk factors that Mr. Ramos presents such as advanced age  diabetes  hypertension  past smoking  and cardiovascular disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,9,CASE REPORT: CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA  Patient Demographics: Mr. G.S. (Initials used to maintain patient privacy) is a 65-year-old African American man from New York City. He is a retired school teacher and lives with his wife. Prior to his retirement 10 years ago  he has been a chronic smoker and drinker but has since quit both habits.  Past Medical History: He has a known diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 20 years  which is fairly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of Hypertension for 10 years with good blood pressure control thanks to regular medical treatment. Mr. G.S. was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) in both legs 5 years ago but has been non-compliant with physiotherapy and medication. Unfortunately  he has never been screened for coronary artery disease  but he denies any chest pain or discomfort to date.  Key Complaints: Mr. G.S. presents with increasing pain in his right calf  especially with walking  over the last six months. But  for the past few days  he's also experiencing rest pain in his right foot - a constant  burning sensation that increases when his leg is elevated and decreases when it is down. He also mentions intermittent numbness and coldness in the affected foot  accompanied by impaired mobility.  Over the past month  he has gained weight and become increasingly sedentary due to his reduced ability to walk around without pain. He has also noticed a poorly healing wound on the big toe of the right foot  with associated local redness and mild swelling but without purulent discharge.  Please note that critical limb ischemia  as presented above  is more prevalent among individuals with a history of smoking  diabetes  and PAD like in the case of Mr. G.S  who needs a rapid evaluation and intervention to prevent limb loss. Also  various research reported higher rates of PAD among African American compared to Caucasians  which is represented in this case. And given the association of CLI with age  gender (men more than women)  and a particular geographic location (urban more than rural)  this case accurately reflects the demographic representation found in literature. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,10,Case Report:  Demographic Information: Patient: Mr. James Whyatt Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Medical History: Mr. Whyatt has a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He is a former smoker and quit ten years ago after a 30-year pack history. His father had a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Mr. Whyatt's medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin.  Key Complaints: Mr. Whyatt has been experiencing persistent numbness  coldness  and tingling in his left foot for the past six months. He also reports intermittent claudication - experiencing pain in his calf muscles when he walks  which subsides with rest.  Previously  he was able to walk up to the local supermarket  around 200 meters from his home  without experiencing pain. However  over the past two months  the distance he can walk without pain has considerably reduced. Lately  the pain has become progressively worse  to an extent where it has started disturbing his sleep. He has noted a peculiar color change in his foot  towards a more pale hue; a few small  non-healing sores on his toes; and decreased hair growth on his left leg.  This clinical scenario suspect towards advanced peripheral artery disease  potentially critical limb ischemia. His pain at rest  non-healing sores  and reduced mobility can signify severe arterial insufficiency.   The case aims at honing skills in recognizing clinical signs and symptoms associated with critical limb ischemia  taking an accurate history  making a correct diagnosis  and creating an appropriate management plan. Additionally  it emphasizes on the role of lifestyle factors and how proper management of conditions like diabetes and hypertension can play a role in preventing severe complications like critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,11,"Case Report  Patient Presentation and Demographics:  The patient is a 72-year-old African American female  named Ms. Johnson. A retired school teacher  she lives in a socially deprived neighborhood of Illinois. She has lived a sedentary lifestyle for some years now  majorly due to a chronic joint disorder.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Johnson has been treated for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus over the past 10 years. Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been marginally controlled. She has a history of hyperlipidemia  treated with statins sporadically. She used to smoke 15 cigarettes per day and stopped smoking about five years ago. Moreover  Ms. Johnson suffers from osteoarthritis  causing much of her physical inactivity.  Complaints:  Ms. Johnson reported to the outpatient department with complaints of persistent pain in her right leg  which she rated as 7/10 on the pain scale. She described the pain as primarily located in her calf muscle  intensifying with walking even short distances and slightly improving with rest. Over the past several months  she has also had sleep disturbance due to this pain  which she referred to as """"rest pain.""""   Her inability to walk normal distances due to the pain  a condition termed claudication  was distressing to her. Simultaneously  she also drew attention to the fact that her right foot felt unusually cold most times  and she started noticing a change in its color.  Conclusion:  This case with classic complaints such as rest pain  claudication  and a cold limb might indicate critical limb ischemia (CLI). Given Ms. Johnson represents a population with risk factors such as advanced age  African American race  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history  makes her a typical case study for CLI and it requires urgent attention and management to prevent its dire consequences. The case serves as a reminder to the medical students to keep the diagnosis of CLI in mind while dealing with similar patients  and emphasizes the importance of controlling modifiable risk factors."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,12,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Demographics:  Mr. James Wilson  a 68-year-old African American male  retired factory worker  residing in Detroit  Michigan  visits the outpatient clinic. He is a widower living with his elder son's family  having a moderate income level. He presents with worsening leg pain primarily in his right leg.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes that he manages with metformin. He admits to smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for many years  only recently quitting two years ago. Five years ago  Mr. Wilson received a diagnosis for Hypertension controlled by Hydrochlorothiazide and Lisinopril. He has a BMI of 32 indicating obesity. His diet consists mostly of high calorie  processed food. No history of any surgical intervention or allergy is reported. He has unprotected exposure to heavy machinery noise during his employment period.  Key Complaints:  Over the past six months  Mr. Wilson has been experiencing noticeable leg pain that worsens while walking  causing him to stop after a short distance. The pain  which he describes as dull aching  mostly dissipates at rest. However  within the last few weeks  he also started feeling some pain in his right leg's lower portion while at rest  especially at night. He has also observed that his right foot appears to be slightly discolored  appearing paler than usual. He claims his right foot has been persistently cool to touch compared to his left foot. He has a noticeable limp. He denied any numbness or tingling. His overall quality of life is deteriorating due to pain and decreased mobility.  This case helps to emphasize the importance of recognizing symptom patterns and their implications  understanding the significance of lifestyle factors such as smoking and diet  understanding the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension  and how they can contribute to serious conditions like Critical Limb Ischemia in culturally and demographically diverse patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,13,Case Summary:   Patient Profile: Mr. Ricardo Sanchez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus poorly controlled  and a 45-year history of tobacco use  presents to the clinic with severe rest pain in his right lower extremity. He also has a non-healing wound on his right big toe.  Main Complaints: Mr. Sanchez reports severe pain in his right foot that predominantly keeps him awake at night. The pain is rated as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. He mentions that he sometimes finds relief by dangling his foot over the side of the bed. He has also noticed a small wound on the tip of his right big toe which developed about 2 weeks ago but has not healed up to now. He denies any fever  chills  or recent trauma to the foot. This severe rest pain and the non-healing wound have greatly inhibited his daily activities.  Review of Systems: No reported chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. He denies any vision changes  numbness or tingerness in hands. No reported weight changes  polyuria  or polydipsia. Duration of pain is approximately 3 months.  Past Medical History: Notable for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus mature onset  and severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Family History: Father died of a myocardial infarction at 70; mother is alive and has hypertension.  Smoking and Alcohol: 45 pack-year smoking history. Denies alcohol use.  Medications: Metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin  Social History: Retired construction worker. Lives alone.  Physical Examination Findings: Examination reveals a thin man in obvious discomfort. The right foot is pale with an absent right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. There is an ulcer on the right big toe that is approximately 1 cm in size. It is clean with visible granulation but deep enough to see bone. Capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.  This case is designed to enhance learners' understanding of critical limb ischemia  reinforce the identification of its symptoms to prevent delays in diagnosis  and encourage developing a comprehensive management plan for such patients. It also underlines the risk factors for critical limb ischemia such as advanced age  smoking  diabetes  and hypertension. The aim is to promote primary and secondary prevention methods to med students for at-risk patient groups.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,14,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Martinez  a 66-year-old Hispanic male with an occupation as a retired firefighter  resides in an urban environment.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has a 15-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he has been taking metformin irregularly. He also has a history of hypertension managed with lisinopril. Mr. Martinez has been a smoker for the past 30 years with an average of 1 pack per day. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) 5 years ago for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and received a stent.   Current Key Complaints: The patient is visiting the outpatient department with a chief complaint of progressive severe pain in his left lower leg that has worsened over the past two weeks. The pain is mainly in the calf and foot  intensifies during walking (even short distances)  and is sporadically present at rest during night-time. He also mentions noticing a non-healing wound on his left foot and some loss of hair on the same leg. He hasn’t noticed any chest pain or shortness of breath recently. He rates his pain an 8 on a scale of 10. His last primary care visit was approximately 6 months ago.  This case was designed to contain elements representative of the patients most likely to present with critical limb ischemia—older individuals with a history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  established peripheral artery disease  and previous cardiovascular events. This is consistent with existing literature  showing that critical limb ischemia is most common in patients over the age of 50 and has a higher prevalence amongst Hispanics and in people with a history of smoking and poorly controlled diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,15,"Case Report: Critical Limb Ischaemia  Patient Information:   Mr. Williams  a 68-year-old African-American male  presented to the outpatient department. He is a retired teacher  resides with his wife  and has two adult children. The patient has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit two years ago. He has no history of drug or alcohol abuse.   Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history includes controlled hypertension for ten years controlled with Lisinopril  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for eight years managed by Metformin  and Hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin. He has maintained these medical conditions under control. He underwent prosthetic heart valve surgery ten years ago and has not encountered any significant complications since then.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Williams reported experiencing progressive  significant right leg pain at rest over the last three weeks. He described the pain as """"aching"""" and rated it 7/10. Besides  he commented about intermittent claudication after walking less than a block and pointed out some color change in his right leg - it appeared pale and became bluish upon elevation. He also reported noticing a non-healing wound around the lateral malleolar region of his right leg for the last two weeks. The patient denied any history of trauma  similar previous episodes  or recent changes in activities or lifestyle. He has not experienced chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness.   Case relevance:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) predominantly affects elderly patients  with a higher prevalence in patients with comorbidities such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol issues which Mr. Williams possesses. Ethnic minorities  particularly African Americans  have been found to be disproportionately affected by peripheral arterial diseases leading to CLI. The case provides medical students an understanding of CLI's clinical presentation and how it can fit into a patient's broader medical history."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,16,Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Jones Age: 65 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Marine Engineer  Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a history of type II diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years. He is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history  although he quit about five years ago. He was diagnosed with hypertension ten years back and has been on regular medication. About three years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Key Complaints:  Mr. Jones presented to the clinic with complaints of severe pain in his right lower limb that worsened over the past few weeks. He described it as a continuous  burning pain that was worst in his foot  especially during night time. He noted that he had difficulty walking and recently had to stop every few meters due to leg cramps. He also reported ulcers on the right foot which have not healed for over a month. Upon further questioning  Mr. Jones reported having lost weight recently.  The above case presents a patient with multiple risk factors for critical limb ischemia  including a history of diabetes  smoking  hypertension  and PAD. His main presenting complaints of rest pain  non-healing uliceral  and intermittent claudication are highly indicative of critical limb ischemia  which is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease.   Demographic Discussion: Literature shows a significant demographic predisposition regarding critical limb ischemia. The disease is more prevalent among elderly men  with the average age of diagnosis being 65 years or older. Caucasians are also found to be more commonly affected  and a history of smoking plays a significant role in the cause of the disease. Diabetes and hypertension  as in Mr. Jones' case  are also significant risk factors.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,17,Case Report:  Patient Profile: - Age: 67 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Hispanic  Medical History: The patient is a 15-year Pack-Year history of smoking and has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are controlled with medication. The patient also has a 10-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and elevated cholesterol levels. His father had peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with complaints of chronic pain in the lower left limb that has been worsening over the past 6 months. The pain is characteristically worse when walking and partially relieved by rest (claudication). In the past two weeks  the patient has noticed that the pain is persistent even at rest and is intensifying  making it difficult for him to sleep at night. He further reports non-healing sores on his foot and decreased temperature of the lower limb as compared to his other extremities. The patient mentions that his left foot often appears pale or bluish and he’s experiencing noticeable hair loss on the leg.  Demographic Note: This case scenario can fit into the demographic bracket as per literature. As per the International Journal of Angiology  Hispanics are associated with a significantly higher risk for PAD  which often progresses to complications like critical limb ischemia (CLI). Moreover  males are more likely to develop CLI than females and the risk further increases with age  with most patients being over 50 years old. The presence of comorbidities such as smoking  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia heightens this risk.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,18,Patient Profile: Name: John Anderson Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Job: Retired postal worker  Residence: Chicago  Illinois   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Anderson comes to the emergency department complaining of unrelenting foot pain at rest that has lasted for the past week  particularly severe during the night time. He also mentions about non-healing ulcer on his right foot and noticeable skin color changes.  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - diagnosed 20 years ago  well-controlled with Metformin. 2. Hypertension - diagnosed 15 years ago  managed with Amlodipine and Lisinopril. 3. History of smoking - 40 pack-years  quit smoking 10 years ago. 4. Peripheral Arterial Disease - diagnosed 3 years ago  treated with Clopidogrel. 5. Myocardial infarction - suffered a mild attack 5 years ago  managed with Aspirin and Atorvastatin.  Current Medications: 1. Metformin for diabetes 2. Amlodipine and Lisinopril for hypertension 3. Aspirin and Atorvastatin as post-myocardial infarction care 4. Clopidogrel for Peripheral Arterial Disease  Patient's Family History: 1. Hypertension - Father 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Mother 3. Stroke - Brother   This case is relevant given the patient's African American descent which presents a higher possibility of developing peripheral arterial disease  critical limb ischemia  and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition  his prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus and history of smoking further increase the risk for such complications.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,19,Case Report:  Patient Information:  We introduce Mr. Ji-Woo Kim  a 64-year-old Korean American retired mechanic residing in Seattle  presenting symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia. His primary language is Korean  but he speaks fluent English. He lives with his wife and son.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Kim has a 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. He has been known to have declined adherence to prescribed medications and irregular visits to the diabetes clinic. He also has peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years ago  and has been on statins and aspirin but has been non-compliant with his medical regimen. He also has a significant 30-pack year smoking history but has been abstaining for the past two years. There is no history of hypertension and any cardiac disease. Also  he has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Kim presented to the emergency room complaining of a three-week history of severe pain in his right foot  significantly disturbing his sleep. This pain intensifies when his limb is hanging down and decreases when he raises it. He's noted a color change to bluish-purplish on his toes. Over the past week  he has started experiencing coldness in his right foot  with his toes looking pale and feeling numb. He mentioned the development of a non-healing wound on his right heel  with occasional pus discharge and foul smell. No history of fever  trauma  or recent surgery.  This case scenario presents the typical profile of a patient with critical limb ischemia: advanced age  male  type II diabetic  PAD  and a current or past smoker. This is supported by literature  as these are the known risk factors for critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,20,Patient Case Information:  Name: Mr. John Thompson Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Medical Background: Mr. Thompson is a former smoker with an extensive history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He gave up smoking about five years ago but was a 30-pack-year smoker earlier. He also has managed hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus being monitored and treated regularly. He had a past myocardial infarction at 55 years and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) at that time.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Thompson  who usually attends his PVD check-ups regularly  came to the clinic presenting acute onset severe rest pain in his right lower leg that has been worsening over the past two weeks. The pain intensifies at night and while his leg is in a resting position  compelling him to hang his leg over the bed to alleviate the discomfort. He also noted the presence of non-healing ulcers on the tips of his right toes which were not present during his last visit 3 months ago. He denies any current chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness.  He also mentioned significant difficulty in walking due to the pain  admitting he can barely manage to walk up to his mailbox anymore due to discomfort.  This case is designed to encourage trainees to consider critical limb ischemia (CLI) in their diagnosis- a severe form of PVD  which can lead to amputation if not identified and managed early. This training case is created to highlight the importance of pro-active management in patients with existing vascular diseases  taking into account the potential for dire cases such as this one.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,21,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Luis Ortega is a 72-year-old Hispanic male with an established residence in Albuquerque  New Mexico. He is a retired high school teacher  married with three adult children  and has a height and weight that fall within normal BMI range.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ortega's past medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus  mixed hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. His diabetes has been sub-optimally managed over the years with Hemoglobin A1c ranges from 7.5%-9.0%. Mr. Ortega is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history. He quit smoking fifteen years ago. His grandmother suffered from peripheral artery disease  which necessitated a lower limb amputation.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Ortega presents with complaints of severe and continuous burning pain in his left foot that has been intensifying for the last six months. He states that the foot is always cold  distressingly pale  with pain exacerbated during the night and sometimes eases slightly when his foot is hanging off the edge of the bed. The pain deprives him of sleep. He’s also noticed skin breakdown and a non-healing ulcer on the big toe of the left foot  despite attempting to treat it at home with over-the-counter remedies. Exercise or walking exacerbates the pain  and he has started using a cane because of occasional limping.   This fictional patient case has been designed to showcase a typical presentation of critical limb ischemia  taking into account demographic representation as found in current literature. The patient's ethnicity  age  associated risk factors  and key symptoms fit within the known epidemiology of the disease. The case aims to help medical students identify  manage  and understand the underlying aspects of this condition. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,22,Case Report:   Patient Description & Demographics- The patient is a 68-year-old African-American male  Mr. Johnson  who currently resides in an urban area. This demographic group has been identified as being at a higher risk for critical limb ischemia (CLI) by several scientific research studies.  Past Medical History- Mr. Johnson is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago  but smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 30 years. He has a medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are being managed with medication. He also has BMI 30  indicating he is clinically obese.   Key Complaints- Mr. Johnson initially presented to the clinic reporting severe rest pain in his right foot  especially at night. The pain has been increasing progressively and has interrupted his sleep for two weeks. His right foot is noticeably cooler than the left and he reports seeing a color change to bluish-grey. He also mentions a non-healing wound on his right big toe. Additionally  he has noticed a decrease in hair growth on his right leg with shiny skin.   These clinical symptoms  in conjunction with his medical history and lifestyle factors  point towards the possible diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  [Suggested Next Steps: In the followings sessions  a discussion could be held on CLI’s physical examination  diagnosis  including imaging techniques  and its management strategies  both surgical and non-surgical.]
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,23,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  Mr. Martin  a 68-year-old African American male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martin has a past medical history significant for a 20-year history of type II diabetes mellitus  poorly controlled  leading to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 15 years ago. He has a 25-year history of half pack a day cigarette smoking but quit 5 years ago. No known allergies to medications. He has never been hospitalized and has not had any surgical history. His medications include Metformin  Lipitor  and Lisinopril.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Martin presents to the clinic complaining of progressive pain in his lower left leg  worsening over the past two months. The pain initially was present during walking but has since progressed and is now present even at rest. He describes the pain as a continuous  severe burning sensation  particularly at his foot  and calf that worsens when his leg is elevated  especially at night.   He also mentions experiencing intermittent claudication after walking approximately two blocks before he has to stop because of the pain  which resolves after resting. Additionally  he reports feeling his lower left leg being colder in comparison to the right. Over the last couple of weeks  he observed dark discoloration of his left foot and loss of hair on his left leg.   The above case is a common presentation for critical limb ischemia. Key demographics such as race  age  and sex have been taken from literature  with African American men over 60 being a demographic particularly at risk. The general health history is also typical  with smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia being common risk factors. The chief complaints  examination findings  and symptom progression are characteristic of critical limb ischemia. Possible future steps might include non-invasive vascular studies  angiography or a trial of medication management depending on the severity  extent  and patient comorbidities. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,24,Case Summary:   The patient is a 69-year-old African-American male  retired mechanic  living in an urban area with a self-reported history of heavy smoking (40 pack years) and high alcohol intake.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a charted history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He also had a previous episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years back but has no known heart disease or past surgical interventions. His medications include Metformin  a statin  and an antihypertensive.  Present Complaints: He presents to the clinic with a six-month history of constant  burning pain in his right calf and foot  which has been becoming progressively worse. He reports severe pain even at rest  especially during the night that often wakes him up. He has noted a decreased ability to walk due to the pain and reveals that his toes have become discolored  turning dark blue over the past few weeks. He also mentions a longstanding issue of intermittent claudication that has now increased in frequency. The patient's pain is not relieved despite elevating the leg and is even worsening. There are also non-healing sores on his right foot.  Owing to financial constraints and poor health literacy  the patient's follow-up and compliance with his management plan have been inconsistent. He also expresses fear and admits non-adherence to dietary restrictions  physical activity  and routine blood sugar monitoring.  Review of system is significant for weight loss  but without night sweats  fever  or cough. He does not have any visual disturbances or weakness in limbs. There’s no reported change in bowel or bladder habits. His family history includes a father and older brother with similar leg symptoms and amputations related to diabetes.   Demographically  critical limb ischemia disproportionately affects older individuals  individuals of lower socioeconomic and educational status  and is more common in people with lifestyles involving heavy smoking and alcohol consumption. African American individuals  diabetics  and persons with peripheral arterial disease have significantly higher rates of amputation due to critical limb ischemia  making the patient’s demographic presentation highly representative of the population affected by this condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,25,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Mr. Alberto Martinez  a 70-year-old Hispanic male  retired mechanic  hailing from San Antonio  Texas. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He lives with his wife and has three grown-up children.   Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has a significant past medical history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes for the past 12 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Records indicate he suffers from obesity with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 31 kg/m2. Over the past few years  he's been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Two years ago  he was treated for a minor stroke  from which he fully recovered.  Key Complaints: Mr. Martinez has presented with a six-month history of intermittent claudication in his left leg  initially after walking a few blocks  now noticeable even at rest. The leg pain has escalated within the past week  leading to sleep disturbance. He's also noticed a few non-healing sores on his left foot and complained of occasional numbness and coldness in his left foot  specifically the toes.   This case study aims to cover aspects of critical limb ischemia  its risk factors  symptoms  and management strategies. The scenario is in line with the patient population suffering from CLI as most patients are elderly  with a significant number of sufferers being Hispanic  and having comorbid chronic conditions such as diabetes  hypertension  and being affected by obesity and PAD. The importance of timely management is highlighted considering the progression of Mr. Martinez's symptoms and his increasing discomfort. This concise case can assist medical students understand  diagnose  and suggest the potential treatment protocol for patients with Critical Limb Ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,26,Case Report:  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Afro-Caribbean female named Mrs. Smith. She is a resident of an urban area and a retired nurse.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith has been diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years and hypertension for over 20 years  both conditions are well-controlled with medication. She also has a 30-year history of smoking  though she stopped smoking 10 years ago. Overweight but not obese  she has a BMI of 28. She has some limited mobility due to osteoarthritis in her right knee.  Chief Complaints: Mrs. Smith visits the doctor with recent progressive pain in the lower extremities for the past 6-months. Initially  the pain was only significant during exertion  especially when walking more than a block or going upstairs (Claudication). But the past 3 weeks  she has been experiencing rest pain  which wakes her up at night. Additionally  she notices her left foot feeling cooler and appearing paler than her right foot. The patient also complains of slow ulcer healing on her left big toe.  This brief case report focuses on the presentation of critical limb ischemia (CLI). It takes into account a high-risk demographic for the disease  as literature notes a higher prevalence in elderly  Afro-Caribbean individuals  with diabetes  hypertension  a history of smoking  and an overweight status further contributing to risk. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,27,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male  who is a retired construction worker. He lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He is a non-smoker but reports drinking alcohol socially.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and has been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. His health records also show that he suffered from a transient ischemic attack three years ago. He is currently on medication for hypertension and diabetes  including Metformin  Lisinopril  and a statin for cholesterol control. His father also had peripheral artery disease  suggesting a familial predisposition.  Key Complaints: The patient came to the clinic with complaints of severe  persistent pain in his left foot which amplifies during the night. He reported that the pain had begun several months ago but has been progressively getting worse over the past few weeks. The patient stated that previously the pain was relieved by hanging his foot off the side of the bed  but this method no longer lessens the pain. He also mentioned having trouble walking due to this pain which often induces a limp. Upon questioning  he revealed that he has noticed a loss of hair on his leg and slower growth of toenails. He also expressed concerns over his left foot being colder than the other and the skin gradually darkening.  This case fits within the demographics seen in literature. Critical limb ischemia is prevalent within elderly populations and is more common in males. Furthermore  certain risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a positive family history play a significant role in the development and advancement of the disease.    Note: The literature has shown a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease in African Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Also  leg symptoms associated with PAD are usually worse during the night and may be relieved partially by leg dependency (Rooke TW  et al. 2011).
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,28,Patient Profile:  Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Gonzales Age: 79 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Gonzales presented with a six-month history of intermittent pain in the left calf. More recently  the pain has been ongoing at rest  increasing in severity and is accompanied by numbness and tingling in the foot.  Past Medical History: The patient is known to have diabetes mellitus for 20 years  is hypertensive for a similar duration  has hyperlipidemia  is a former smoker and has a family history of peripheral arterial disease.  Physical examination: General examination reveals pallor and an underweight patient with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5. On examination of the left lower limb  there is loss of hair  with cold  mottled skin  macerated toes and no palpable pulses below the femoral artery. The right lower limb exhibits similar changes  though less severe  with weakly palpable tibialis posterior and dorsalis pedis pulses.  Key Learning Objectives:  1. Understand the pathophysiology of critical limb ischemia in the context of comorbidities like Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension 2. Identify the risk factors and clinical features of critical limb ischemia  3. Develop skills for performing a comprehensive peripheral vascular examination 4. Recognize the importance of duplex ultrasound  CT angiography and angiography in diagnosing critical limb ischemia 5. Understand the principles of management of critical limb ischemia including risk factor modification  medical therapy  endovascular procedures  and bypass surgery. 6. Understand the potential complications of untreated critical limb ischemia and the prognosis  Further Discussion: This case is designed to develop a student's clinical reasoning necessary for recognizing and managing critical limb ischemia  which is a common yet serious condition especially amongst older  diabetic patients. This case allows students to engage with multiple components of care - from understanding the etiology and risk factors  identifying physical signs  interpreting appropriate investigations to management strategies.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,29,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old African American female who is retired from a clerical position and has been living alone since the passing of her husband 5 years ago. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years.   Past Medical History: She has a documented history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus for which she is on regular metformin therapy  and hyperlipidemia for which she takes statins. She has a family history of coronary artery diseases with her father suffering from an acute myocardial infarction at 65 years of age. She also has a personal history of peripheral artery disease  diagnosed 2 years prior but has not been regularly monitored or aggressively managed.  Chief Complaints: The patient presents to the Emergency Department with a complaint of severe ongoing rest pain in the right lower leg which has worsened over the last few days  with the pain often keeping the patient awake at night  and hence categorized as a Rutherford Category 4.  On examination  a significant temperature difference is noted between the two legs. The right foot is cold to touch with apparently mottled skin and loss of hair. Pulses in the right leg are not palpable. Non-healing ulcers are noted on the right big toe and the heel.   This case study represents a demographic group that demonstrates higher prevalence for critical limb ischemia  i.e.  chronic smokers with poor glycemic control and hypertensives that are African American. The patient's presentation and symptoms align with classic signs of escalating peripheral artery disease leading to critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,30,Patient Information:  - Age: 67 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired factory worker - Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 17 years - Hypertension for 10 years - Former smoker who quit 5 years ago - Past leg injury in a factory 15 years ago - Family history of peripheral artery disease  Key Complaints:  The patient has presented with progressively worsening  chronic exertional calf pain in the right leg over six months  which now interrupts his sleep. The patient mentions experiencing rest pain for the past month  which is severe enough to prevent him from keeping his leg in a horizontal position during sleep. The pain is located predominantly in the foot and prompts him to hang his leg over the edge of the bed or walk around the room for relief.  Recently  he’s noticed a non-healing ulcer at the tip of his right big toe. No history of fever or chills. He is also reporting progressive fatigue and weight loss over the same period.  This case of a 67-year-old African-American male with a history of diabetes  hypertension  and smoking is consistent with the demographic group commonly affected by critical limb ischemia (CLI)  as supported by evidence in medical literature. The patient's symptoms of chronic severe foot pain at rest and non-healing foot ulceration are classic presentations of CLI.  This case will help medical students identify key risk factors (e.g.  diabetes  hypertension  smoking  age above 50  African-American race)  characteristic symptoms  and potential consequences related to critical limb ischemia.                                     
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,31,Patient Profile:  Mrs. Mary Johnson  a 68-year-old African American female  retired school teacher  non-smoker  from a semi-urban neighborhood.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Johnson is a known hypertensive for 10 years and has a four-year history of Type 2 Diabetes managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia for the past five years. She has no known allergies. Her family history reveals her late father had Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and her mother had hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes.  Chief Complaints: Mrs. Johnson has been suffering from severe and persistent pain in her left lower extremity  more severe in the foot  and increases at rest. The pain initially started around six months ago  but it was mild and intermittent  eased with rest  which she attributed to her age and routine physical activities.   Lately  she has noticed the left foot to be pale and cooler compared to the right one  along with slower hair and nail growth. The pain usually exacerbates during the night and hanging her leg over the edge of the bed provides partial relief.  Mrs. Johnson reports that for the past two weeks  she has been experiencing difficulty walking due to severe walking-induced calf pain  and has been limping as a consequence. Over the past couple of days  she experienced slight blackening of the lateral toes which was accompanied by a sharp  continuous pain. In parallel  she complains of muscle weakness  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss.  NOTE: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a serious form of PAD. It's more common in people over the age of 60  has an increased prevalence among African-American populations  and is strongly associated with hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. These specifics have been included in the patient's presentation to maintain an accurate demographic representation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,32,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Mr. A  a 67-year-old African-American male  retired Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  is presented in this case. The strong disposition of African-Americans and men in general to peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  of which critical limb ischemia (CLI) is an end-stage manifestation  is well stated in the literature.  Past Medical History: Mr. A was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and was also reported to be a smoker for the past 30 years but had quit smoking five years ago. His routine medications included Metformin for diabetes  Amlodipine for hypertension  and a Statin for hyperlipidemia. In addition  he has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his late father having experienced a heart attack in his sixties.  Presentation and Key Complaints: Mr. A visited the emergency department accompanied by his daughter  complaining of a two-day history of severe rest pain in his right foot  which was worse at night. He reported the pain was not relieved with over-the-counter pain drugs. He also mentioned that his foot looked 'a bit more blue-ish' than normal and felt cooler than the other foot. On closer inquiry  he also admitted to ulcers on his toes that had been slow to heal for the last two months. Previous to that  he reported a more than six-month history of pain in his calf muscles while walking  which would relieve on rest - classic symptoms of claudication.   Given his past medical history and current symptoms  CLI is suspected and needs prompt examination and diagnostic tests for confirmation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,33,Case Report:   Patient Information:   Mr. Rodriguez is a 73-year-old Hispanic male  retired as a long-term construction worker. He is a long-term resident of a rural farming community in Texas. Mr. Rodriguez is fluent in Spanish and English.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant past medical history  including a 30-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension for 25 years  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit smoking 10 years ago. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and underwent a successful angioplasty. There is no known drug allergy history.   Current Medications:  His daily medications include metformin 1000 mg  lisinopril 10 mg  atorvastatin 20 mg  and aspirin 81 mg.   Key Complaints:  In the last six months  Mr. Rodriguez has been noticing intermittent claudication  particularly when he goes for his usual early-morning walks but improves with rest. In the last eight weeks  there has been a progression of his symptoms  with pain at rest  particularly in his right foot. He also noticed a non-healing ulcer around his right heel for three weeks now.  His wife also mentioned Mr. Rodriguez had experienced a few episodes of nocturnal pain where he had to hang his foot out of bed for relief.   On examination  there are notable diminished pulses in the right lower extremity compared to the left. The right foot shows a poorly perfused heel ulcer with associated signs of local infection.   The above case presents a classical scenario of critically limb Ischemia (CLI) in a demographic that is correctly represented for this medical condition. Different aspects of social determinants of health  critical clinical skills related to history taking  physical examination  differential diagnosis  and further diagnostic workup and management strategies could subsequently be explored with the students using this case. This case is purposely designed to mimic real-life clinical scenarios thus helping students to learn in an environment that promotes active and adaptive learning.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,34,Patient Profile  Name: Mr. John Washington Age: 72 years Gender: Male Race: African American Socioeconomic Status: Retired military officer; receives pension  Past Medical History: Mr. Washington has a history of Type II Diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years  well managed on medication. He has moderate chronic kidney disease and a history of coronary artery disease  for which he underwent angioplasty 5 years ago. He maintains a smoking habit of about 10 cigarettes daily for over 50 years. He is on Metformin  Ramipril  Atenolol  and Aspirin.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Washington has come to the clinic complaining about recurrent  severe pain in his left lower leg that has been ongoing for the last 6 weeks. He describes the pain as a burning sensation that often becomes worse when his leg is elevated and slightly relieved when dangled. He is also worried about a small wound on his left foot that does not seem to be healing. He reports experiencing discomfort during walking  limiting his daily activities.  This case offers a concise but comprehensive patient history to address the topic of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient's demographic  including his age  race  and socioeconomic status  reflect the typical CLI population. His medical history presents the common risk factors for CLI  such as diabetes  kidney disease  heart disease  and a smoking history. The complaints described  including leg pain and non-healing wounds  represent the typical signs of CLI. These factors allow medical students to establish the correlation between risk factors and disease manifestation and understand the patient's presentation in the context of CLI.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,35,Patient Information:  Mr. J. Smith  68-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  living with his wife in rural Georgia.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a former smoker and has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years  hypertensive for 20 years and moderate peripheral artery disease diagnosed ten years ago. He has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia but is non-compliant with the lipid-lowering therapy.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith presents with severe cramping and pain in his right calf  especially during short walks  which his wife noticed started a month ago. He also mentioned episodes of pain in his foot at rest  particularly when lying down. His wife brought him to the doctor after she noticed the color change (pallor) in his right foot  sometimes appearing a bluish hue  and it was consistently cold to touch. Mr. Smith also complains about a non-healing wound on the lateral aspect of his right foot. Furthermore  he noticed that his toenails are growing slowly  and there is paucity of hair growth on his lower leg.  Note: Critical limb ischemia is more prevalent in elderly populations (especially over 65)  males  and African Americans  with contributory risk factors such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and peripheral artery disease. The fact that Mr. Smith lives in a rural area should also be noted  as healthcare access may be limited  potentially contributing to delay in diagnosis and management of this condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,36,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Robert Thompson  a 68-year-old African American male with a history of social smoking for past 30 years. He is retired and lives with his wife. Based on overall literature  he represents a demographic that is most commonly affected by peripheral arterial disease and consequent critical limb ischemia due to higher prevalence of associated comorbidities and lifestyle choices.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson suffers from hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  which has been managed for the past ten years. Previous documented medical reports reveal sub-optimal glycemic and blood pressure control. He has also previously undergone bilateral below the knee amputation  a history of recurrent foot ulcers  and a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease – all attributable to his diabetes and smoking history. He also has a history of stable ischemic heart disease.  Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson has presented to the emergency department with a 3 week history of rest pain in his right lower limb and a non-healing ulcer on the lateral aspect of his right foot. The pain is described as a continuous  excruciating burning sensation that becomes more pronounced when his limb is elevated and slightly relieved by hanging his limb off his bed. He has also noted increasing numbness and discoloration (darkening) of toes.  Additional vital detections in the physical examination and necessary diagnostic investigations will steer the further course of understanding Critical Limb Ischemia more clearly  thus creating a more comprehensive case for student training.                            
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,37,Patient Presentation:  Patient: Mr. Juan Rodriguez Age: 70 Gender: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired construction worker Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumer  Mr. Rodriguez presents to the outpatient vascular clinic with discomfort in his left foot that has worsened over the past couple of months. He describes an ongoing ache paired with occasional sharp pain that intensifies with walking and is slightly relieved by rest. Recently  he noted some changes in coloration of his foot  which is now rather pale  and a non-healing ulcer on his great toe.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which he is prescribed oral medications. His adherence to medication has been variable. Despite receiving diabetic education  he has struggled to maintain optimal dietary habits. His last recorded HbA1c 9 months ago was 8.0%.   Key Complaints:  1. Chronic left foot discomfort intensifying with exertion and partially relieved by rest.  2. Observations of color changes in his left foot - appearing pale.  3. Non-healing ulcer on the great toe of his left foot.  This case is designed to reflect the typical presentation of a patient at risk of critical limb ischemia. According to literature  critical limb ischemia patients are more often male  elderly  frequently have a history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a high percentage are of the Hispanic population. This case attempts to represent these demographics accurately while emphasizing the common symptoms and the significance of the disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,38,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Name: Mr. J S Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Complaint: The patient arrived in the outpatient clinic with a history of rest pain in his left lower limb that has been progressively worsening over the last three weeks. He describes the pain as severe  often disturbing his sleep at night. The pain is predominantly located in his foot and is not relieved by ordinary painkillers. He also reports occasional discomfort after walking about 50 meters  leading to a significant decrease in his walking distance.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 12 years ago and has been treated with Metformin. He also has Hypertension  managed by Lisinopril. He is a former smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack-years but claims to have quit smoking 10 years back. He has no known allergies.

Physical Examination: There is marked pallor in the left foot compared to the right  with diminished temperature. The Distal pulses including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are not palpable in the left foot  while they are palpable and are in normal volume in the right foot. An ulcer was noted on the plantar aspect of the left foot. No signs of gangrene.   This case is designed to represent a typical presentation of critical limb ischemia in an older male patient with several risk factors including diabetes mellitus  hypertension  former smoker  and familial predisposition. The severe rest pain and physical signs of ischemia provide a concrete talking point for discussing the diagnosis and treatment of critical limb ischemia. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,39,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 74-year-old African American male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a long history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 (diagnosed over 30 years ago)  stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD)  and hypertension (HTN) diagnosed ten years ago. He has been a two packs a day smoker for the past 50 years. His family history is significant for heart disease  having lost his father and brother to heart attacks.  Critical Complaint: The patient has reported severe rest pain in his left lower leg for the last two months  particularly when lying down and at night. He complains of a tingling sensation and numbness in the toes of the left foot. Lowering the limb provides some relief from the pain. He also discloses issues with coldness in the left foot  difficulty in walking  loss of hair on the lower leg  and noticeable slowing in the healing of minor cuts on the foot. He denies any chest pain  dyspnea  or dizziness.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals an underweight elderly male  pallor  a diminished pulse in the left foot compared to the right  and well-healed scars of previous foot ulcers. His left foot is noticeably colder than his right foot  with visible changes in skin coloration. The skin over the left lower leg is shiny and atrophic  with loss of hair  and the nails have become thickened. There are no palpable pulses in the left foot.   Relevant Investigation:  Following clinical examination  the patient is sent for Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) testing  Doppler Ultrasound  CT Angiography  and blood tests including HbA1c  Lipid profile  and kidney function tests.   This case above aims to help medical trainees understand the demographic representation in critical limb ischemia involving factors like age  race  male gender  uncontrolled diabetes  smoking  and chronic kidney disease.  The case exhibits classical clinical symptoms of rest pain  non-healing ulcers  changes in skin color  and palpable pulse  focusing on the importance of early diagnosis and the need for appropriate management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,40,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Demographics   Name: Mr. Carlos Gonzalez  Age: 68 years old  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired Bank Manager   Past Medical History   Mr. Gonzalez has a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin and a daily exercise regimen. He also has a history of hypertension  controlled with lisinopril. He quit smoking 15 years ago but smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for approximately 30 years before that. Mr. Gonzalez does not consume alcohol regularly.   Key Complaints   Mr. Gonzalez presents with severe pain in his right lower leg  stating that the pain has been less responsive to over-the-counter pain medications and is interfering with daily activities  even occurring at rest. He also reports increased sensitivity to cold temperatures and a noticeable change in the color of the right foot  becoming paler than his left foot.   Upon further questioning  Mr. Gonzalez also mentions a significant decrease in hair growth on his right leg and a recent non-healing ulcer on his right heel. He denies any recent trauma to the limb but asserts discomfort while walking  leading to limping.   This case is designed with accurate demographic representation in mind; critical limb ischemia is more commonly seen in patients who are over 60  male  and have a history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension. Its main symptoms include limb pain  non-healing wounds  and changes to the skin. The inclusion of a Hispanic patient reflects this group's higher risk for peripheral artery disease.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,41,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  • Name: Mrs. Josephine Davis • Age: 68  • Gender: Female • Race: African-American   • Occupation: Retired School Teacher • Insurance Status: Medicare • Location: Urban setting  Detroit  Michigan  Past Medical History:  1. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 20 years ago  managed with insulin and dietary changes) 2. Hypertension (controlled with medication) 3. Previous smoker (quit 10 years ago) 4. Obesity (BMI: 34)  Chief Complaints:  Mrs. Davis visited her primary care physician’s clinic with following complaints: 1. Gradual worsening of pain in the lower right leg over the past six months  particularly while walking or sitting. Describes it as an intense  cramp-like pain. Found temporary relief with over-the-counter analgesics. Recently the pain persisted even during rest  often disturbing sleep.  2.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,42,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)   Patient Information:  Gender: Male  Age: 68 years old  Race: Caucasian   Educational Background: Retired secondary school teacher  Marital Status: Married  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Johnson reports experiencing rest pain in his right lower limb continuously for the past couple of weeks. The pain seems to intensify at night. He has chronic non-healing ulcerations on his right foot for the past two months. He also reports intermittent claudication with severe pain in his thigh and calf muscles during walking  causing him to stop walking after a short distance.  Past Medical History:  - Hyperlipidemia diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with diet and statins. - Smoking history: 40 pack years. Attempted quitting multiple times but unsuccessful. - Type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. - Medication allergies: None.  Social History:  Mr. Johnson is a retired teacher living with his wife. He has been a smoker since the age of 25  although he has tried to quit several times. He maintains a relatively healthy diet but has a history of being physically inactive. He consumes alcohol occasionally in moderation.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs upon examination were stable. There are non-healing ulcers located on the dorsum of the right foot. Peripheral pulses in the right foot are notably weak. The foot is cool to touch with notable pallor. There is loss of hair on the lower portion of right leg and dry skin. Sensation is decreased in the right lower limb.  Pertinent Laboratory Data  Imaging and Special Tests:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) would be warranted in this case due to high suspicion of peripheral arterial disease. Duplex ultrasound  CT angiography  or MR angiography can also be considered for confirmation if ABI is lower than 0.9.  Assessment:  The patient's symptoms suggest the probable diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the severe stage of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Plan:  Early mobilization of multidisciplinary vascular team including vascular surgeon  internist  endocrinologist and physical therapist for aggressive management of the limb ischemia along with underlying conditions is recommended to prevent limb loss.  In the next session  students should prepare to discuss management strategies for this case including pharmacological therapy  lifestyle changes  possible need for revascularization procedures and impact of comorbidities on the prognosis. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,43,"Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:   - Mr. Abel Thompson - 65-year-old African-American Male - Living in rural Wisconsin  USA - Retired construction worker  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension controlled with medication  - Diabetes mellitus Type II diagnosed 10 years ago  poorly controlled (HbA1c 8.5) - Dyslipidemia managed with statins - Smoker  40-pack years - Moderate alcohol consumption - No prior surgeries  Presenting Complaints:  - Progressive severe pain in his left lower leg for the past month  significant worsening over the last two days. The pain is described as a constant burning sensation  sometimes escalating to sharp jabs. It seems to intensify at night or when the leg is elevated. - Noticing a slow-healing ulcer on the big toe of the left foot for the past two weeks. - Experiencing fatigue and limp while walking short distances; he has had to stop his regular evening walks around the block due to this symptom. He describes this as """"claudication."""" - Observes that his left foot feels colder than the right foot.  - Noticed the skin of the left foot is paler than the right foot and has taken on a bluish hue over the past week. - Loss of hair on the left leg.  Note: The case above focuses on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe condition of peripheral arterial disease. CLI often results due to atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion of the lower extremity arteries. It is particularly pertinent to patients like Mr. Thompson  who have a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia. The patient's demographics and lifestyle context reflect a typical CLI patient as indicated in medical literature.   "
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,44,Case Report:  Patient Details:  Name: Mr. Johnson  Age: 65 years  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: African American  Occupation: Retired cab driver   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson suffers from chronic Type II diabetes for the past 15 years  coupled with hypertension for 10 years. He also has a history of smoking  with 20 pack-years smoking history. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years ago.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson came to the outpatient department  complaining of continued pain in his left lower limb for the last two months. He indicated that the pain had been progressing and worsening  interfering significantly with his sleep  and even occurring during periods of rest. Initially  he experienced the pain when he walked long distances or climbed stairs  a condition known as intermittent claudication. However  the pain started becoming more frequent and intense  even when he was not doing any physical activity. The pain was concentrated in the calf of his left lower limb and was often described as sharp or burning.   He also observed a marked diminished temperature in his left leg compared to his right and reported a non-healing ulcer over his left toe for the last three weeks. He also reported experiencing milder symptoms in his right leg but focused on his left due to the severity of pain.   Additional Comment:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD) that is more common among geriatric patients and those with risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. CLI is observed to be overly represented among African Americans compared to other racial or ethnic groups. The disproportionate amount of CLI cases among African Americans warrants a special focus and diverse representation among clinical cases to train future medical professionals.   This case of Mr. Johnson demonstrates a typical progression from intermittent claudication to rest pain and development of non-healing ulcers. Medical students should be educated about prompt diagnosis and interventional treatment to avert potential limb loss associated with CLI.

He has never had a foot ulcer or gangrene. He has no known allergies. Family history reveals a father who had a stroke in his late 60s and a mother who had peripheral artery disease.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Rodriguez came to the hospital with complaints of severe and continuous resting pain in his right lower limb  particularly below the knee  for a week. He describes the pain as sharp and constant which gets worse at night. He also reports color changes in the feet (his feet turning pale on elevation and dusky red on dangling)  reduction in the temperature of his right foot  and has noticed that the hair growth on his right leg has slowed down. He also mentioned about slowly developing numbness and non-healing sores on his right foot. He denies any trauma or injury to the foot. His pain has caused sleep disturbances and difficulty in performing basic daily activities. He denies any chest pain  palpitations  breathlessness  abdominal pain  weight loss  or fever.  Note:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) usually presents among older individuals  with the mean presentation age around 70 years. CLI tends to impact men more but the distribution is almost equally disseminated across different ethnicities. Hence  Mr. Rodriguez has been selected as a Hispanic male to represent this demographic distribution. CLI risk factors include smoking  diabetes  hypertension  high cholesterol  and coronary artery disease  all of which are mirrored in Mr. Rodriguez’s medical history to exemplify a realistic clinical history. His key complaints adhere to the typical presentation of CLI  emphasizing ischemic rest pain  color changes  and non-healing sores.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,46,Case Report - Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Information: - Demographics: 68-year-old Asian male - Occupation: Retired mechanic  Past Medical history:  The patient has a 10-year history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. There is a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. The patient quit smoking 1 year ago.   Chief complaint:  The patient presents with progressive pain in the right lower limb  primarily in the calf muscle  which has worsened over the past three months. The pain starts even when he walks short distances  leading to a significant limp. He notes that the leg's pain intensifies when he is lying flat but tends to subside when he hangs his feet off the side of the bed. He also expresses concern about non-healing ulcers on his right foot's great toe and heel noticed about six weeks ago.   Weight: 95 Kg  Height: 175 cm  BMI: 31.0 (Obese)  On physical examination: The patient has a significant pallor  indicating possible anemia. On cardiovascular examination  reduced pulsations were found in the right femoral and dorsalis pedis arteries. There is the presence of a non-healing ulcer on the right foot's great toe and heel which measures 1.5cm and 2cm  respectively. The right lower limb's skin appears shiny and has a lack of hair growth  indicating poor blood supply to the limbs.  This case focuses on a patient presenting with critical limb ischemia  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease. In literature  this condition is most seen in the elderly population over the age of 60  with a predominance in Asian populations  males  and those with a history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,47,Case Report:  Patient's Information: Name: Mr. Rodriguez  Age: 67  Occupation: Retired  Gender: Male Race: Hispanic  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Rodriguez seeks medical attention  reporting a month-long history of increasing pain in his lower right leg  noticeable particularly during any standing activity or walking. He also mentioned a burning sensation at rest. He has been experiencing noticeable lower temperatures in the right foot compared to his other foot.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a significant medical history which includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years. He was also diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. He was an active smoker but quit five years ago after receiving treatment for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease.   Observation & Clinical Signs: Upon physical examination  Mr. Rodriguez manifests signs of critical limb ischemia such as a substantially reduced anterior tibialis pulse in the right leg  accompanied by pain upon palpation. His right leg is slightly discolored compared to his left one and shows some trophic changes (thin  shiny skin  absence of hair). A foot ulcer is noted on the ball of his right foot.  The case of Mr. Rodriguez is representative  according to literature  as critical limb ischemia is commonly seen in elderly patients with a history of diabetes and hypertension. The condition is also frequently associated with smoking and COPD. This case study serves to highlight key signs and symptoms of the disease  such as rest pain and the presence of ulcers  which medical students need to be aware of  in order to take prompt actions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,48,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: -Mr. Shoji  Asian Male -Age: 68 years  -Occupation: Retired aircraft engineer -Living situation: Living alone -Socioeconomic status: Middle income   Past Medical History: -20-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  not consistently regulated  HbA1c 7.8% -10-year history of Hypertension  controlled with Amlodipine 10mg daily -10-year history of Hyperlipidemia  controlled with Atorvastatin 20mg daily -5-year history of Peripheral Artery Disease  not previously symptomatic  Family history of Cardiovascular Disease: -Father suffered myocardial infarction at age 62  -Older sister diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease at age 64  Habits: -40 pack-year history of smoking  quit 3 years ago  Key Complaints: -Mr. Shoji has been experiencing drastically worsening pain in his right foot over the past month--even at rest. His foot is often cold to the touch  there's noticeable hair loss over the right lower limb  and his toenails have become discolored. -On questioning  the patient also states intermittent claudication occurring after walking merely 50 meters. The claudication has gotten progressively worse over the last six months. -Non-healing ulcers are present on three toes of the right foot. He denies any trauma or injury to the leg or foot.  Based on his past medical history and current symptoms  Mr. Shoji may be suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. Comprehensive assessment and intervention  considering the high-risk factors and features presented by the patient  would be needed.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,49,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischaemia  Patient Demographic:  Name: Mr. George Evans Age: 74 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Construction Worker  Medical History:  Mr. Evans is a 74-year-old Caucasian male ex-smoker with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 13 years. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and he had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) five years ago. He has a BMI of 32 and leads an essentially sedentary lifestyle. His prescribed medications include metformin  ACE inhibitor  aspirin  statin  and bronchodilators for COPD. He is compliant with his medications but has poor glucose control despite adjustments in his diabetes medications. He has a family history of heart disease and stroke.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Evans made an appointment with his GP after noticing increasing pain in his right leg  particularly when walking  for the past two months. Recently  he has been feeling this constant discomfort even at rest  described as aching and often severe  mostly located in his right calf and foot.   He has also reported nocturnal cramps  painful ulcers developing in his lower leg and foot  and a decrease in the temperature of his limb compared to the left. He has been experiencing difficulty in walking  often feeling weak. His sleep has been disturbed due to the pain  which is relieved when he hangs his foot over the bed. He noticed his right foot looks comparatively pale and bluish  has shiny  tight skin  and there is noticeable hair loss on his lower leg.   He and his wife are worried about the obvious change in color and temperature of his right foot  and worsening pain causing difficulty in walking and sleep disruption. They are reluctant but open to judgement regarding the need for amputation  if required.   This scenario presents a classic case of critical limb ischemia with rest pain and grade IV ischemia according to the Fontaine classification  necessitating further investigation and strategic management. It's a useful training case to understand the clinical manifestation  differential diagnosis  investigation  and treatment strategies of critical limb ischemia in a high-risk patient with significant past medical history. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,50,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics:   Mr. Carlos Gutierrez is a 68-year-old Latinx male with a long-term residence in a predominantly Hispanic community in Corpus Christi  Texas. He was a professional truck driver with a sedentary lifestyle and is a retired veteran. He is bilingual  primarily speaking Spanish at home. Mr. Gutierrez lives with his wife  with occasional visits from their children and grandchildren. He used to smoke for 40 years but quit ten years ago. His diet primarily features traditional Mexican cuisine and he is also known to consume significant quantities of alcohol on social occasions.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Gutierrez has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  managed by metformin  and Hypertension  controlled with ACE inhibitors. He has been non-compliant with his medication schedule over the last six months  due to financial issues and a lack of understanding of the importance of his medications. He also has a history of dyslipidemia and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  but he has not sought treatment due to a fear of medical procedures. Mr. Gutierrez recently experienced an unmitigated weight loss  which is noteworthy. He does not have any known drug or food allergies.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Gutierrez was brought to the hospital by his wife  who grew increasingly worried about his health status. He complains of chronic pain in his left lower limb  especially during nighttime. The pain disrupts his sleep and forces him to hang his foot over the bed's edge – a condition known as """"rest pain"""". In addition  he mentions that he has started limping because his leg tends to get extremely cold and changes color to pale when he walks for some distance  and then it turns darkish-red when he stops – a severe form of intermittent claudication. On probing  the patient admits to having noticed a non-healing sore on his big toe that has progressively blackened over the last few weeks.  The clinical picture fits the description of Critical Limb Ischemia  a grave manifestation of Peripheral Artery Disease  which requires urgent attention to prevent limb loss. The patient's history of comorbidities makes him a typical case  representing the demographic most affected by this condition as per literature. This case underscores the need for an in-depth study about PAD  its severe consequences if left untreated  and the challenges that cultural and individual fears  lifestyle habits  poor compliance  and financial constraints pose in disease management."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,51,Patient Case:  Name: Mr. Joseph Frazier   Age: 72 years old   Sex: Male   Ethnicity: African American   Occupation: Retired coal miner  Background:  Mr. Frazier has a combined past medical history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus  peripheral arterial disease  and hypertension. He is a former smoker of 40 years who quit 6 months ago and has 3 alcoholic beverages weekly. He lives alone but has a very supportive family who visits regularly.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Frazier presents with increasing pain in his right lower leg and foot. The pain intensifies during activity and slightly subsides when at rest. Over the last three weeks  he also noticed that his foot became darker in color and much cooler to touch. Moreover  he had a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. He also admits to fatigue  decreased appetite  and unintentional weight loss over the last couple of months.  Key Markers: Upon examination  the patient's right foot shows signs of dark discoloration  the palpable absence of pulse below the knee  and localized gangrenous changes around a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum of his right foot. Furthermore  he scores a 7 on the rest pain scale.  This case should aim to help students identify and manage critical limb ischemia. The demographic information reflects scientific literature: patients with critical limb ischemia often have a history of smoking  are likely to have comorbidities like diabetes mellitus and hypertension  and are aged or older adults. Also  black people are twice as likely to have peripheral arterial disease than their white counterparts. The case should also emphasize the gravity of early detection and treatment to potentially prevent amputation  and the role of lifestyle modifications in managing such conditions. It should explore different treatment strategies including medication  endovascular procedures  and bypass surgery  each with its risks and benefits.   Sources: - Norgren  L.  Hiatt  W. R.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,52,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Thomas  Age: 68 years  Sex: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired Truck Driver  Location: Urban  Insurance: Medicare   Past Medical History: - Mr. Thomas has a history of type 2 diabetes which he has been managing with metformin for twenty years. - He has been a chronic smoker for about 40 years  but quit five years ago. - Had suffered from hypertension and was treated with amlodipine for about 10 years. - Also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  found during a routine physical exam two years ago.  Key Complaints: Mr. Thomas came for a routine check-up with complaints of consistent  severe pain in his right lower limb which increased over the past month. It started as intermittent claudication and has now progressed to rest pain  particularly in his foot. He claims the pain is so severe that it disrupts his sleep. He also mentions that his right foot feels colder compared to the left one.  Upon examination  the doctor noticed that his right foot appeared pale with an absence of hair growth  shiny skin  and slow-healing  superficial ulcers on the tips of his toes.   This case sets up a focused study on critical limb ischemia  providing an opportunity for students to learn about risk factors (like diabetes  smoking  and PAD)  the importance of patient history  and early detection and treatment strategies. Given the demographic variety in the most affected by CLI—primarily older  male  and African American populations—Mr. Thomas accurately represents the typical patient profile.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,53,"Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:   Mr. James Miller  a 65-year-old African American male  presents at the emergency department accompanied by his son.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Miller has a long-standing history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and has been a smoker for several years. He was also diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  8 years ago  but compliance with prescribed medications has been sporadic. He has no known allergies. His surgical history includes an appendectomy and meniscal repair surgery of the right knee.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Miller reports a 2-month history of increasing pain in his left lower extremity  specifically his left foot  which worsens during ambulation and partially relieved by rest. The patient also complains about a non-healing wound on his left great toe for the past 3 weeks. The pain has been severe enough over the past few days to awaken him from sleep. He also expresses concerns about his left foot looking """"darker"""" than usual.  These signs and symptoms are consistent with characteristics of critical limb ischemia (CLI) found in literature to include pain at rest  ischemic skin lesions or gangrenous changes  and a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD).   Mr. Miller is an example of a typical patient described in the literature – elderly  male  having T2DM  smoker  and belonging to an ethnic minority – who face a high risk of developing peripheral artery disease (PAD) and eventually CLI. Prompt identification of individuals at risk of developing CLI  like Mr. Miller  and timely treatment is crucial to preventing serious complications such as limb loss.   Stay tuned for further case progression and management strategies for Mr. Miller’s CLI."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,54,Patient Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Raymond M. Age: 70 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired steel worker  Past Medical History: Mr. Raymond has a long-standing history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both moderately controlled with medication. He is also a former smoker but has refrained from smoking for 11 years now. There is a history of myocardial infarction approximately four years ago. He also has intermittent claudication for which he received conservative management in the form of medication and lifestyle modifications.   Key Complaints: Over the past few months  Mr. Raymond has been experiencing a significant increase in pain in his left lower limb  especially during the night. Despite making sure to rest and elevate his limb  his pain persists and has been interfering with his ability to sleep. He also noted that his foot appears pale and unusually cool to touch. He has also observed the development of non-healing ulcers on his lower leg and foot. Additionally  advice from his podiatrist to use custom shoes and maintain foot care did not prevent ulcer development.  Critical Assessment and Considerations: The persistent pain in Mr. Raymond’s limb at rest and non-healing ulcers point towards a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). As Mr. Raymond already has a history of peripheral artery disease (intermittent claudication) and risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and smoking  his case aligns with a common demographic and medical history found in many CLI patients as reported in literature. Immediate diagnostic evaluation and management strategies are necessary to control pain  improve wound healing  and prevent limb loss.   This case will guide medical students in understanding the clinical pathway  treatment options  and preventive strategies for patients with chronic conditions leading to critical limb ischemia. It will also increase their awareness of the high-risk demographics for the development of such conditions.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,55,Case Report – Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Mr. Rodriguez  a 67-year-old Hispanic male with a high-school education  of low socioeconomic status  is employed part-time as a janitor. He is a lifelong resident of an urban area with a history of tobacco use  reportedly smoking one pack a day for the past 40 years.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has a documented past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which he takes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin  respectively. His diabetes is sub-optimally controlled with a recent HbA1c of 8.2%. Three years prior  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) for which he undergoes regular follow-ups but has shown poor compliance to the prescribed medication and lifestyle modification counseling.  Key Complaints: Over the past four months  Mr. Rodriguez noticed a consistent discomfort in his right lower extremity  particularly while walking  which heals relatively after resting. This pain started growing in intensity and duration. Now  he complains of severe resting pain in his right foot  even at night  disrupting his sleep. He also reports intermittent claudication after walking about half a block. Mr. Rodriguez noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe about two weeks ago  which he attributed to a minor trauma. He mentions that his right foot feels colder compared to the left one. Of note  his peripheral pulses in the right foot are markedly reduced.   Case Discussion: Mr. Rodriguez’s demographics and clinical history follow the profile commonly noted in cases of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  one of the severe presentations of PAD. CLI is more common in males  older adults  and those with a history of smoking and co-morbid conditions like diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Lower socioeconomic status and poor access to healthcare are influential social determinants in patients with CLI. His symptoms of ischemic rest pain  non-healing ulcer  and reduced temperature and pulses in the affected foot create a high suspicion for CLI. This case can be used for training students in recognizing the risk factors  clinical features  pathophysiology  diagnosis  and management of CLI.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,56,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Demographics: The patient  Mr. Alfred Johnson  is a 70-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of Type II diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease  and hypertension which are well-managed through medication. He also has a history of tobacco use with a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 15 years ago.   Present Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents with complaints of persistent pain in his right foot which is severe enough to disturb his sleep. He described the pain as constant  burning  and not relieved by changes in position  prescribed painkillers  or rest. This started 6 months ago as intermittent claudication that was then relieved by resting  but now has progressed to rest pain.  On examination  his right foot appears pale with marked hair loss and weak pedal pulses. The temperature comparison of both feet shows his right foot is cooler. Healing blisters and a superficial ulcer measuring 2x2cm are seen on the lateral malleolar area  indicative of previous minor trauma.   Mr. Johnson reports that he has been unable to carry out his daily activities due to the excruciating pain. His condition aligns with PAD Stage IV (Fontaine stage) - critical limb ischemia.   Discussion: Critical limb ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. It often affects older patients  with an average age of diagnosis around 70-80 years - about 500-1 000 cases per million per year. The incidence is higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and in smokers like Mr. Johnson. With timely and efficient diagnosis and management  the symptoms can be alleviated  and limb salvage can be achieved in most patients.  Given that African Americans have a higher risk of peripheral artery disease  they should be carefully evaluated and managed to prevent the condition from escalating to critical limb ischemia which requires aggressive treatment strategies. Therefore  accurate evaluation and prompt detection of this severe arterial disease are essential in medical education.  It is essential to note that peripheral artery disease often remains asymptomatic until it progresses into its severe form  underlining the importance of getting regular screenings for high-risk populations.   In this case  medical students will be able to get a comprehensive understanding of critical limb ischemia  from its risk factors (like age  race  diabetes  and smoking) to its gradual and often quiet development  as well as its progression  signs  diagnosis  and management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,57,Patient Case: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Information:  Name: Robert Thompson Ethnicity: Caucasian Age: 71 Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Executive Residence: Suburban  moderate-income housing Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History:  Robert is a former smoker with a 25-year history  having quit 15 years ago. He has been diagnosed with primary hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and Type-2 diabetes  not well-controlled. He has a BMI of 29  placing him in the overweight range. He also has a history of sedentary lifestyle; however  he has been trying to walk more recently due to his doctor's advice.  Chief Complaint:  Robert came in complaining of consistent  intense pain in his lower left limb  which he rated an 8 on a scale of 1-10  that is notably worse when he tries to walk  which he describes as claudication. The pain often wakes him up at night. Additionally  he reported lingering numbness and coldness in the same limb. He mentioned that the skin on his leg has turned slightly bluish and his toenails have stopped growing. His wife also noticed a lingering sore on his foot that seems to refuse to heal. His symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past six months  but he thought it was due to aging until the pain become unbearable.  This patient case is reflective of the common demographic of critical limb ischemia patients  those who are in their 70s  have a history of smoking and other cardiovascular risk factors (such as hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and diabetes)  likely overweight  and sedentary lifestyle. As the critical condition is more typical with advancing age  the selected patient details reflect the prevalence among elderly males. On top of this  his socioeconomic status could affect the overall severity and management of his condition due to disparities in healthcare access and management.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,58,Patient Case: Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics:  Mr. Gonzales  a 66-year-old Hispanic male. Occupation: Retired construction worker. Tobacco use: 30 pack-years  quit 13 years ago. Alcohol use: Social drinker. Lives alone  has two adult children living out of state.   Past Medical History: Mr. Gonzales has a past medical history significant for Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a history of intermittent claudication diagnosed five years prior. He has had no previous surgeries and is currently on metformin  an ACE inhibitor  a β-blocker  and a statin.  Presenting Complaints: Over the past six months  Mr. Gonzales has been experiencing increasing bilateral lower extremity pain even at rest  which has interfered with his sleep. Accompanying this pain  he has also noticed both feet becoming progressively discolored  now appearing pale and cold to touch. More recently  he has developed small  painful  non-healing wounds on his left foot.  These complaints have restricted his mobility and have also caused considerable emotional distress as he lives alone and worries about the implication for his independence.  Reflecting literature  this case aims to highlight high-risk factors known in critical limb ischemia: age  male gender  Hispanic or African American ethnicity  diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and smoking history. These all contribute to the development of peripheral artery disease  the most common cause of critical limb ischemia.    
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,59,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  Mr. Jackson  African American Male  Age: 70 years   Chief Complaints:  Pain in his right lower extremity  recurring ulcers on right foot  change in color of right foot  reduction of mobility  and mild rest pain.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has a 20-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago.   In addition to these  medical records indicate previous episodes of ischemic stroke with no significant neurological deficits  non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  and chronic kidney disease stage 3 secondary to diabetic nephropathy. He has a 30-pack year history of smoking and has been a chronic smoker for the past 50 years.   Assessment:  Mr. Jackson's family brought him to the emergency department of the hospital  primarily because of the high pain level  intermittent claudication and non-healing wounds. The patient described the pain as persistent  progressively worsening over the last few weeks  and slightly relieved on raising the leg. He also complained of disturbing sleep patterns due to pain (rest pain) and significant difficulty in carrying out daily physical activities.  Physical Examination:  Primary observation pointed towards a noticeable color change (pale) in the right foot. Upon closer examination  ischemic ulcers were detected on the right toe and heel  with evident signs of infection  including pus discharge and surrounding erythema. Pulses were weak in the right foot on palpation. There was no evident sensory loss or motor weakness.  The severity of the symptoms  the non-healing nature of the ulcers  and the progressive pain  even at rest  all indicated a high possibility of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  an advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease.  Further investigation  such as Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) testing and angiography  will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the extent of disease progress.  The above case includes an African American male patient as they have been found in literature to be disproportionately affected by PAD and CLI compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Diabetes and smoking  known risk factors for these conditions  have also been included in the patient's medical history.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,60,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Rodriguez Age: 70 Years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired Manual Laborer Residential area: Urban  Patient History: The patient  Mr. Rodriguez  has been moderate to heavy smoker for the past 50 years  averaging about 15 cigarettes per day. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM)  undercontrol with oral medications and lifestyle modifications for the past 15 years.  He has had high blood pressure (hypertension) for about 10 years managed by medications. There is no history of coronary artery disease or renal disease; however  he was once diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease five years ago. His BMI indicates that he is overweight and he also experiences occasional bouts of shortness of breath suggestive of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease secondary to years of smoking.  Validation of Information: Mr. Rodriguez's demographic details and medical history accurately represent the risk factors identified for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in Hispanic males  as described in extant literature. His history of smoking  Type-II diabetes and hypertension contribute significantly to the increased risk of CLI. Moreover  the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease further increases the probability of developing CLI.  Key Complaints: Over the past month  Mr. Rodriguez has been combating severe pain in his left leg that initially started as intermittent claudication (cramping pain with exercise or walking)  but has now progressed to constant rest pain. He experiences numbness and tingling sensation in his feet with episodes of sharp shooting pain. Additionally  he has noticed slow-healing ulcers on his feet. Recently  he also complains of his left foot feeling unusually colder than the rest of his body.  Preparation: Understanding the criticality of CLI  immediate medical intervention is crucial for Mr. Rodriguez. This case will provide medical students an opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of evaluating a patient with CLI- beginning with a detailed history to physical examination  arriving at the differential diagnoses  understanding the appropriate diagnostic procedures (Ankle Brachial Index Test  ultrasound  angiogram)  necessary interventions like angioplasty or bypass surgery and stressing on the importance of disease management and patient education in minimizing the risk factors.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,61,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Jenkins  a 69-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  presenting to the outpatient clinic. He is a non-drinker and quit smoking ten years ago after a 40-pack year history. He is divorced and lives alone.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Jenkins has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years  which is not well-controlled (last HbA1c- 8.2%). He also has hypertension managed with medication for the last 20 years. He had a myocardial infarction ten years ago leading to quitting smoking. There is no known history of cancer  pulmonary  renal  or liver disease.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Jenkins presents with increasing pain in his right lower leg that has gradually worsened over the past few months. The pain is severe  constant  worse at night  and not relieved by over-the-counter painkillers. He reports the pain primarily in his calf and foot  which feels worse when walking even short distances and eases slightly when he is at rest. He also expresses concerns over the right foot appearing pale and cold and has noticed some non-healing sores on his toes. Furthermore  he complained about significant unintentional weight loss over the last few months.  This case is demographically representative as literature identifies older age  male gender  African American ethnicity  smoking  diabetes  and cardiovascular diseases as risk factors related to critical limb ischemia. By the conclusion of the case study  students should be able to rule out differential diagnoses  recognize the signs and symptoms of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) leading to critical limb ischemia  and determine appropriate treatment options.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,62,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: • Age: 70 years • Gender: Male • Ethnicity: Hispanic (as per the CDC  Hispanic people tend to have a higher risk of peripheral artery disease which can lead to critical limb ischemia) • Occupation: Retired - Past occupation involved long hours of stationary standing   Past Medical History: • Past smoker for 40 years (stopped 5 years ago) • Diagnosed with Type II Diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  poorly controlled blood glucose levels • High cholesterol levels  diagnosed 8 years ago • History of intermittent claudication for 3 years  Key Complaints: • Seeking help for a non-healing ulcer on the right foot - present for the past 2 months  despite treatment attempts • Intense rest pain in the right lower leg for the past 4 weeks  worsening at night • Limited mobility due to pain and fear of worsening the foot ulcer • The patient reported to have noticeable temperature difference to touch in comparison his other foot • Loss of hair growth on the right leg  The development of a non-healing foot ulcer combined with rest pain in the setting of a history of intermittent claudication  diabetes  and smoking is indicative of a possible diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. This patient's risk factors and symptoms align with the disease characteristics  providing a strong foundation for a teaching case.

Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with Stage II hypertension under control with Atenolol. He also has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus managed with Metformin and Glyburide for the past 8 years. His lipid profile is abnormal; he is having hyperlipidemia for which he is on Atorvastatin.   Key Complaints:  The patient presents with complaints of excruciating pain in his left lower limb over the past 3 weeks. The pain is noticeably severe in his foot  especially at rest  and gets worse during the night. The patient noted that walking even short distances triggers the pain.    He also describes his left foot as feeling notably colder compared to the right foot. He mentions an ulcer on his left big toe that has been present for the past week and has not been healing. Upon inspection  the ulcer showed evidence of gangrene.  The patient also complained of a dull ache in his left calf muscle which occurs after walking a short distance and forces him to stop. He stated the pain subsides after about 5-10 minutes of rest. In the past week  the patient observed that this """"claudication distance"""" has been steadily decreasing.   Due to the severity of the patient's symptoms and his impaired mobility he is clearly distressed and scared about his condition.  This case is representative of the typical demographic (older  male  Caucasian) and comorbid conditions (smoking  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension) associated with higher risk for critical limb ischemia  as outlined in the literature."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,64,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. A  an 70-year-old African-American male. He is a retired construction worker  married  and lives with his wife in the urban area.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a history of type II diabetes mellitus for the last 25 years and hypertension for the last 15 years. He has been a two-pack a day smoker for the last 50 years  only quitting about a year ago. His diabetic control has been relatively poor with frequent swings in blood glucose. His hypertension is controlled with medication. He has no personal or family history of heart disease or stroke.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. A has been noticing an increasing pain in both his legs for the past 1 year  which has been worsening over time. The pain starts while walking a few blocks and eases with rest (claudication). The pain was initially present only in the left calf but now involves both calves. Over the past month  he has started to experience pain even while resting. His wife mentioned that his left foot often looks bluish at night and is particularly cold to touch.  In addition to the pain  he complains of numbness on the dorsal aspect of his left foot. He reports having recently noticed deterioration in the wound healing of a small cut which occurred about 1 week back. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.  Given the available information and the patient's complaints  the index of suspicion should be high for critical limb ischemia developing in someone with identifiable risk factors. This case aids medical students and educators in understanding how to diagnose and formulate a suitable treatment plan for an elderly patient with chronic symptoms related to peripheral arterial disease  including critical limb ischemia. Further evaluation and treatment would focus on pain management  wound care  and interventions (lifestyle changes  medical or surgical) to improve blood flow to the affected limb.   The case represents the high-risk demographic based on data from the literature. Critical limb ischemia most commonly affects patients aged 60 and older with a history of smoking and long-standing diabetes  with a higher prevalence reported among African-Americans.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,65,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old African-American male with a body mass index of 34  from an urban community.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a 40-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He also has hyperlipidemia and a 45-pack/year history of smoking  which he quit 5 years ago. He has intermittent claudication that has worsened over the last six months. His current medications include insulin  metformin  Lisinopril  Atorvastatin  and Aspirin.  Key Complaints: The patient presents with severe rest pain in the right lower limb lasting for more than two weeks. The pain is described as a burning sensation at the base of his foot that is worse at night and often interferes with his sleep. It marginally improves when he dangles his leg over the bed. It has been increasing to the point of the patient being unable to put on a shoe due to the pain. He also complains of escalated fatigue and weakness in the right leg while walking  often needing to stop and rest. He reports non-healing sores on the same foot. He also noticed a change in color and temperature of the same foot.   Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals an obese man in apparent distress due to pain. Skin inspection shows dry and shiny skin on his right foot with noticeable hair loss. Two small ulcers (approx. 1.5 cm each) are observed on the dorsal part of the foot showing minimal signs of healing. Palpation discloses a lack of both dorsal pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the right foot while other peripheral pulses are intact. The right foot is cooler to touch compared to the other. Capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds in the right foot. No signs of deep vein thrombosis are observed.   This case is representative of the common demographic consisting of elderly men  often smokers  with a long history of uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  that are generally seen amongst critical limb ischemia patients. The ethnicity  African-American  has also been chosen as they are considered to be at a higher risk for peripheral arterial diseases. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,66,Case Report:  Subject: Mr. Lee Wilson Age: 68-year-old Race: African-American Gender: Male Occupation: Retired school teacher Locality: Urban  Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a chronic history of type-2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  which is reasonably controlled with medications (Metformin and Glipizide). He is also hypertensive for the past 10 years controlled with Lisinopril. Past smoking history of 30 packs per year  but he quit smoking about 5 years ago. There is no history of any cardiac disease.  Chief complaints:  Mr. Wilson arrived at the clinic with complaints of pain in his left leg that is consistent  worsening over the past two months. The pain was significant at rest and intensified with walking  frequently leading Mr. Wilson to stop frequently (intermittent claudication). He also described feelings of persistent coldness in his affected limb. On some occasions  he has noticed a pale bluish hue of the skin of his left foot  which resolves upon keeping the foot at rest in a dependent position. There has been a recent non-healing ulcer on his left big toe  causing him significant discomfort. There is no recent history of trauma.  Mr. Wilson’s family members have noticed him limping recently and becoming increasingly reluctant to leave home due to his functional limitations. He has also lost about 10 pounds due to poor appetite over the past month. He has not experienced any chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  Upon exploring  these symptoms have been causing Mr. Wilson significant distress and interfering with his ability to perform daily activities  including walking his dog and grocery shopping.   Review of literature indicates that African American males have a higher incidence of peripheral arterial disease due to various risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. This case will allow students to learn and discuss about screening  diagnosing  and managing patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The training will also emphasize on addressing factors contributing to health disparities.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,67,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male coming from a low socio-economic background. He is a retired construction worker and has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for approximately 45 years. He is a non-drinker and lives with his wife. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 65  while his mother had a stroke in her late 70s and is surviving.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  controlled with oral medication. He also has hypertension that is managed with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In addition  he has dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) which is regulated with statins. He has no history of heart attack  stroke  or kidney disease. His last routine check-up was 6 months ago.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient has come in complaining of recurring and intense pain in his right calf and foot  which has been worsening over the past three months. He states that the pain is concentrated when he walks even short distances and often wakes him up at night. He noticed an ulcer on his right big toe about a month ago  which hasn’t shown significant improvement despite regular wound care. He also reported feelings of cold in his right foot compared to the rest of the body. Additionally  he has lost several pounds unexpectedly over the past few months.  Conclusion:  The combination of the patient's demographic information  past medical history  and presenting complaints points toward critical limb ischemia. Other peripheral arterial diseases may also be considered  but this appears most likely given the classic presentation of pain and non-healing ulcer. Further assessment via angiography and ankle-brachial index measurements would help confirm the diagnosis  leading to appropriate and urgent intervention. This case emphasizes the importance of considering this severe disease in patients  particularly elderly  diabetic  hypertensive  or tobacco-using individuals  presenting with symptoms like intermittent claudication and chronic ulcers.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,68,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischaemia  Patient Information: Mr. Jose Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  presents to the outpatient clinic with worsening pain and discoloration in his right foot.  Past Medical History: He is a smoker with 45 pack-years and has a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 8.9) for the past 12 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He denied any history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  stroke  or Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). He is on Metformin  Lisinopril  and a Statin.  Patient Complaints: Mr. Lopez reports his symptoms started about 3 months ago  initially as a dull ache in his calf after walking for more than a block  alleviated by rest (Claudication). Recently  he started experiencing pain in his right foot  even at rest  particularly at night. He also notes that the foot appears paler than usual and feels colder to touch. He has not noticed any sores or ulcers  but has been having difficulty sleeping due to the pain.   Clinical Findings: On physical exam  Mr. Lopez has diminished pulses in the right foot  skin is cool to touch  with noticeable pallor. Popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable on the right side. There is no visible ulceration or gangrene.  March/April 2022  This case study review reflects the prevalence of Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI) often associated with males (sex) and Hispanics (ethnicity). Moreover  CLI is widely associated with advanced age  smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The typical presenting symptom is progressive ischemic rest pain  commonly more intense at night as seen with Mr. Lopez. He also demonstrates physical signs of limb ischemia including pallor  coolness and decreased peripheral pulses. The absence of palpable pulses is common in patients with CLI. Smoking cessation  diabetes control and statin use  seen in patient’s profile  are included as important discussion points for risk factor modification in managing CLI.                           
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,69,"Patient Profile: """"Mr. James Anderson"""" is a 73-year-old African-American male residing in Tennessee. He is a retired Postal Service worker living with his wife and is a father of three children. He is a non-smoker but has been drinking alcohol moderately throughout his life.   Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a known history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) that he manages with metformin and a balanced diet; hypertension controlled with amlodipine; and coronary artery disease (CAD)  for which he underwent coronary angioplasty three years ago. He also has a known history of elevated cholesterol levels managed with statins. His father had a myocardial infarction and passed away at the age of 70.  Key Complaints: He presents to the clinic with complaints of recurring  severe pain in his left lower leg while walking  which usually goes away with rest. The patient also has noted that his left foot looks more pale compared to the right foot and has been feeling persistently cold. Recently  he noticed a small  non-healing ulcer on his left heel. He disclosed that he has difficulty sleeping due to the lower leg pain.  Training Case Notes: In line with the age and disease predicament  Mr. Anderson displays the standard symptoms of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  The main risk factors for CLI include smoking  diabetes  obesity  age  and a sedentary lifestyle. However  aging and African-American ethnicity are also significant risk factors as per demographic representation derived from literature. As part of the training case  students should comprehensively evaluate the patient's condition  focusing on the physical examination (specifically  cardiovascular and peripheral vascular examination) and appropriate diagnostic testing  with an understanding of the risk factors and the importance of early recognition and intervention to prevent limb amputation."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,70,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired blue-collar worker Sex: Male  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled type II diabetes for 25 years and hypertension for 10 years. He also has a smoking history  having smoked a pack a day for 30 years  though he quit smoking 5 years ago. Further  he had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago  for which he underwent successful angioplasty.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Johnson presents complaining of increasing pain in his left lower limb  particularly when he's walking  but notably also at rest  especially during the night disrupting his sleep. He mentions that the pain often temporarily eases when he dangles his leg over the side of his bed. He reports progressive fatigue and weakness in the affected limb. Over the last two months  he's noticed that his left foot looks paler than the right one  is often cold to touch  and has suffered a decreased hair growth. Recently  he also noticed a poorly healing ulcer on his left big toe.  This case represents a typical patient with critical limb ischemia. The demographic details align with the literature  which shows a high prevalence of critical limb ischemia in older  male  Caucasian patients and in those with comorbid conditions like diabetes  hypertension  coronary artery disease  and a history of smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,71,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 72-year-old Hispanic female brought to the hospital emergency department due to severe resting leg pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  and hypertension for 20 years  which are under control with metformin  statin medication  and a combination of ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics. She also has a 30 pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. She was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago.  Chief Complaints: She complained of worsening leg pain that was disturbing her sleep for the past week. It was a distal  burning pain located on her left foot. She also reported non-healing ulcers on her left toe and dry gangrene. She felt coldness in her left lower extremity and significant fatigue and pain even with minor activities such as short-distance walking  which had improved slightly with rest. She had no complaints of chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  Most of her symptoms align with the typical PAD symptoms  more severe due to critical limb ischemia. The ischemic rest pain for over two weeks indicates the severity of her PAD  leading to poor blood flow  which can cause pain even during rest or sleep. The non-healing wounds and gangrene are also common in patients with critical limb ischemia due to insufficient blood supply for repair and growth.  Discussion: This case for discussion should point out risk factors like age  Hispanic ethnicity  long-standing diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  smoking  female sex  and existing PAD condition. According to the literature  diabetes mellitus (79%) is the most reported risk factor for critical limb ischemia  followed by hypertensive disease (67%) and hypercholesterolemia (40%). Also  as per population demographic data  females & Hispanic ethnicity should be recognized more in such studies. The students should recognize the importance of proper management of these modifiable risk factors as they significantly contribute to the progression of PAD to critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,72,Patient Information:   Mr. Robert Fernandez  a 70-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  based in New York City. He is a non-vegetarian  moderate alcohol consumer and quit smoking 10 years ago  after being a chain smoker for 40 years.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of Type II diabetes mellitus for two decades  poorly controlled. He also suffers from hypertension and has undergone two instances of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). His family history reveals that his father suffered from premature coronary artery disease and died from a myocardial infarction at 65. Patient is currently on Metformin  Losartan and Aspirin.  Chief Complaint/ Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Fernandez has come in complaining of severe pain in his right lower leg for the past month  which worsens when he walks or stands for a long period of time (claudication). He also mentions that the pain sometimes wakes him up at night. On close examination  it is also noted that he has a non-healing small ulcer on his right foot big toe. He has noticed changes in the color of his right foot  which now appears pale and feels colder than the other one.   These presenting symptoms along with his past medical history point towards the onset of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This case would allow medical students to study the comorbidity of diabetes and cardiovascular disease  particularly CLI. The case focuses on early detection  management strategies like lifestyle modifications  drug therapy  endovascular treatment options  and also delves into the patient's psychosocial background  echoed in a significantly represented demographic. It offers students an opportunity to engage in a multidisciplinary approach to patient care  involving cardiology  endocrinology  vascular surgery  and wound care specialties. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,73,Patient Case Report:  Patient Identification Details:  An 76-year-old African American female.  Presenting Complaints: The patient came to the emergency department complaining of a severe  persistent pain in her right lower limb extending from hip to foot that is worse when at rest or lying flat. She mentioned she frequently awakes from sleep due to the pain. She also reported non-healing ulcers on her right foot and discoloration of the toes.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 30 years  poorly controlled. She also has a diagnosis of Hypertension for the past 10 years and a history of smoking due to which she had been diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 7 years ago. She quit smoking 5 years ago. Her medications include Metformin  a Calcium Channel Blocker (Amlodipine) and an Angiotensin-Converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitor (Lisinopril). There is no known drug allergy. She has undergone appendectomy 25 years ago.   Social History: She lives alone and is relatively independent in daily activities. She is retired and has no exposure to harmful substances like radiation  asbestos  or heavy metals. She stopped smoking 5 years ago after smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for almost 35 years.  Family History: Both her parents had diabetes and her father had died from myocardial infarction at an early age. Her only brother also has diabetes and has undergone lower limb amputation due to chronic peripheral vascular disease complicating his diabetes.   This case aims to provide a representative scenario of critical limb ischemia  which primarily affects the elderly  patients with history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension highlighting the importance of early recognition and timely management in preventing severe sequelae like limb amputation.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,74,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Oscar Martinez Age: 75 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired factory worker  Past Medical History:  Mr. Martinez has a longstanding history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He also has been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years. He suffered from a myocardial infarction five years ago and was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) two years ago  for which he undergoes regular follow-up.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Martinez presents to the outpatient vascular clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower leg  especially at night. It wakes him up from sleep and he states that hanging his feet over the side of his bed slightly alleviates the pain. He also reports the development of slow healing ulcers on his right foot  specifically over the distal phalanges of his first and second toes. He noticed a slight color change towards a bluish discoloration on his right foot.  On examination  his right foot is cool to the touch  with a noticeable difference compared to his left foot. His dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are comparably weaker on the right side versus the left. The foot ulcers are observed to be non-bleeding with defined edges  showing no signs of infection. However  there are signs of muscle atrophy and hair loss on his right leg  indicative of chronic ischemia.  This present history and clinical examination is suggestive of critical limb ischemia  possibly secondary to his underlying peripheral arterial disease. Mr. Martinez requires urgent diagnostic evaluation  vascular consultation  and appropriate management to prevent limb loss  considering that the condition is a medical emergency with a poor prognosis if left untreated.   This case can be used as a tool to educate medical students on the pathophysiology  clinical manifestations  diagnosis  and management of critical limb ischemia  as well as the possible lifestyle and systemic factors that can predispose individuals to this condition like smoking and diabetes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,75,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information  - Name: Mr. John Davis - Age: 72 years old - Gender: Male - Race: African-American  - Occupation: Retired construction worker  Past Medical History  Mr. Davis has a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes mellitus poorly controlled with diet and oral hypoglycemics  Hypertension managed with Lisinopril  and Tobacco dependence (40-pack year smoking history; quit 4 years ago). Furthermore  he had a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed two years ago.  Presenting Complaints  Mr. Davis has presented with a three-month history of severe  persistent leg pain at rest  which escalates at night to the extent of disturbing his sleep. He reported a leg ulcer below his right ankle that was not healing over the past 6 weeks. In addition  Mr. Davis also complained about the presence of intermittent claudication - causing him to stop after walking for less than 1 block due to pain. Over the ensuing weeks  he noticed a decline in the distance he was able to walk before experiencing the pain. He also reported instances of coldness in the same foot with discoloration.  Physical Assessment  On physical examination  Mr. Davis had a heart rate of 84 beats per minute  blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and temperature 98.2 °F. Cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormal heart sounds  while pulmonary examination was normal with no wheezes or crackles.   On inspection  his right foot appeared pale and cold to feel than the other foot. Peripheral pulses in the right leg (popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibialis) were notably weak. The aforementioned ulcer was found on the medial aspect of the right leg just below the ankle  measuring approximately 3cm in diameter. It had a pale base  was surrounded by erythema  and had a scant amount of serous drainage.  This is a classic representation of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving strict glycemic control  antihypertensive therapy  pain management  and ultimately revascularization surgery if the patient's health permits. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,76,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient's Information:  The patient is Mr. James Diaz  a 68-year-old Hispanic male who resides in rural Texas. His occupational history reveals he's a retired military officer and now spends his time farming.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Diaz came in stating he has chronic pain in his right lower limb  escalating in severity over the past 6 months. He also mentions the formation of non-healing ulcers on his lower leg and foot  which are not responding to over-the-counter remedies. He further adds experiencing coldness  numbness  and mild discoloration in the leg  raising his concerns.  Medical and Family History:  Mr. Diaz has a marked medical history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  managed with medications and lifestyle modifications. He has been a smoker for more than thirty years but stopped a year ago. He claims at least two episodes of TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) in the last five years. His father had peripheral artery disease and his mother  a hypertensive and diabetic  died of a stroke.  Social History:  While Mr. Diaz is currently a non-smoker  he admits to having smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for about 35 years. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. His diet is moderately high in fat due to his cultural background. He lives with his wife on their farm and has limited physical activity due to his advancing age  pain  and the rural nature of their residence.   Preliminary Diagnosis:  Based on the presenting symptoms  medical history  and lifestyle factors  the patient appears to have advanced stages of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Further diagnostic investigations and management plans are to be considered based on this preliminary diagnosis.  [Note: This case is created for the purpose of educational activity and does not represent any real individual  living or dead.]
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,77,Patient Information:   Mr. Albert Thompson  a 65-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30 pack-year history of smoking. He has been noncompliant with his medicines due to financial and personal struggles.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Thompson presented to the outpatient department complaining of persistent pain in his right foot that had been troubling him for the past three weeks. The pain is aggravated at rest  especially during the night  and is partially relieved on dangling the foot. He also mentioned occasionally noticing some non-healing sores on his right foot  a decrease in the temperature of the foot  and a recent history of intermittent claudication upon walking short distances.   This concise training case focuses on critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries  which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. CLI is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Studies show it affects around 2-3% of the general population aged over 50  with men and the black race being disproportionately affected. Risk factors include age  smoking  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and renal insufficiency. Hence  Mr. Thompson’s case represents an accurate demographic and clinical picture of the CLI as seen in literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,78,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male  unemployed  with a history of heavy smoking habits. He resides in an urban area  within a socio-economic disadvantaged environment  factors all correlated to a higher prevalence of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He lives alone but has a daughter who visits him weekly.  Past Medical History:  He has a significant medical history of untreated hypertension  uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  and dislipidemia. He has had no previous vascular interventions. Family history is positive for coronary artery disease in his father  who passed away at 65.  Key Complaints:  The patient consults with complaints of a chronic non-healing wound on his right distal foot for the last three/seven months. The wound is characterized by significant pain at rest  which often interrupts his sleep. He states that the pain somewhat subsides if he sits on the edge of his bed dangling his foot. He has recognized a color change in his foot  with it appearing more pale and cooler to touch. His subjective report indicates a score on the Rutherford scale of 5  hinting possible ischemia.  Additionally  due to increasing discomfort and pain  the patient confides that he has difficulty in walking over the past year  and has decreased his activity level  leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. He reports that he experiences significant pain after only walking a few meters; he labels this as 'walking disability'. Narrating his symptoms  the patient shares that he experiences fatigue  heaviness and cramping in his calf muscles.  The above-indicated case will aid in training medical students by providing a comprehensive perspective about patient background  significant symptoms and severity status of the disease  thereby facilitating appropriate diagnosis and management. As such  this case reflects demographic groups most affected by Critical Limb Ischemia as per available literature.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,79,"Case Report  Patient Demographics: -Caucasian Male -Age: 65 years  -Occupation: Retired Construction Worker -Smoking history: Smoked one pack per day for 40 years  quit 5 years ago -Alcohol: Social drinker -Weight: 84 kg -Height: 175 cm -Residence: Suburban   Past Medical History: -Bilateral total knee arthroplasty 7 years prior -Hypertension controlled on Lisinopril -Type 2 diabetes controlled on Metformin -40 pack-year history of smoking  quit smoking 5 years ago  -Has not kept up with regular exercise due to increasing pain in lower limbs.  Presenting Complaints: -Intermittent claudication (pain upon walking) for the past six months that stops at rest -Pain in right lower leg while resting in the last two weeks  describes it as severe  burning sensation -Noticed non-healing sores on both feet and darkened areas of skin -Heating pad provides some pain relief -Increasing fatigue and weight loss -Sudden severe pain in his right lower leg after being outside in cold  This case introduces a patient who presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed beyond intermittent claudication to pain at rest. The patient has several risk factors traditionally associated with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and CLI  including advanced age  heavy smoking history  diabetes  and hypertension. The non-healing sores on the patient's feet are likely due to poor circulation  an aspect of CLI. Considered a medical emergency  CLI can result in limb amputation if not dealt with promptly or effectively. The patient's severe pain  or """"rest pain """" signifies a high risk of limb loss.   Demographic information aligns with typical CLI patients – namely  an older  Caucasian male with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Globally  CLI tends to disproportionately affect older populations with a male predilection. The patient's history of smoking  diabetes  and hypertension are common among CLI patients."
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,80,Patient Information: Age: 68 years old Sex: Gender: Male Race: African American Smoking History: 40 pack-years  Chief Complaint: The patient complains of severe pain in the left lower leg  rest pain  non-healing ulcers on his left foot  and noticeable loss of hair on the same leg.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled type II diabetes and hypertension. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) two years ago and has a significant history of cigarette smoking. The patient also suffered a minor stroke six years ago but managed to recover with minimal residual neurological deficits.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient's left foot is found to be pale with weak pulse. Ulcers are present on the toes and heel of the left foot  and the left lower leg shows signs of muscle wasting. The patient's pain seems to be relieved when his leg is in a dependent position.  Note: This vignette depicts a typical patient suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). African Americans  smokers  diabetics  and those with a history of hypertension and stroke are identified as high risk groups in the literature. The major complaints of severe leg pain  rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and physical signs like weak pulse  pale foot  and hair loss are common in CLI patients. To make this vignette more effective  ensure that students not only focus on a CLI diagnosis but also consider the patient's overall health and other complicating factors (uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension). The training case can further delve into potential treatment options like surgical revascularization or medication management using antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,81,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Laura Diaz (hypothetical patient) Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race: Hispanic/Latino Occupation: Retired schoolteacher  Past Medical History: 1. Smoking history of 30 years – stopped 10 years ago. 2. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  with a poor glycemic control. 3. Patient has been hypertensive for the past 10 years and is on regular medication. 4. Diagnosed with Hyperlipidemia 8 years ago. 5. Diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago. 6. Underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) for ischemic heart disease 7 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: The patient comes in complaining of severe pain in her left lower limb  mainly in the calf region  that has been present for the past 3 months. She's noticed the occurrence of ulcers on her left foot that are not healing. Pain happens even at rest and she's been experiencing discomfort and difficulties with sleeping. She also expresses concerns about her left foot seeming 'colder' than the other.  These symptoms are suggestive of critical limb ischemia  which is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease. Its prevalence is increased among the elderly  smoking individuals  diabetics  hypertensive patients  and people with hyperlipidemia - all of which feature in our patient's medical history. Hispanic/Latinos have also shown susceptibility to diabetes and subsequent trends of PAD and CLI.   With this case  the students can understand the risk factors  clear clinical presentations  and long-term consequences of critical limb ischemia  informing their future clinical decision-making and patient-management abilities.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,82,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information Name: Mr. Rodriguez Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Presenting Complaints  Mr. Rodriguez came to the hospital complaining of recurring severe pain in his right foot  mainly at rest and frequently disturbing his sleep. He reported a prolonged and slow-healing sore on his upper right foot. He also shared experiencing a sensation of coldness in his foot and a noticeable decrease in the strength of his right leg  making walking difficult and strenuous. The patient mentioned his foot often turning pale when he lifts it and reddish-blue when he lowers it. He also noted a recent weight loss.  Past Medical History  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago  hypertension for which he takes medication  and a smoking habit of 20 cigarettes per day for the past 50 years. He also suffered a minor stroke two years ago  resulting in mild residual left-sided weakness. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft for ischemic heart disease about five years ago and is on a daily aspirin regimen. He reported a family history of peripheral artery disease.  Clinical Scenario  Based on Mr. Rodriguez's symptoms  history  and physical examination showing a non-healing ulcer  loss of hair on his legs and feet  weak or absent peripheral pulses  and a reduction in muscle mass  the suspicion is high for critical limb ischemia (CLI). This condition is considered a severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and occurs predominantly among the elderly population  smokers  diabetics  and those with a history of cardiovascular disease.  To manage CLI  immediate medical attention is required  or Mr. Rodriguez could face amputation. A multipronged approach of lifestyle changes  controlling contributory disease factors like diabetes and hypertension  medication  possible revascularization procedures  and regular follow-ups should be considered as treatment.  The key learning points from this case are the importance of recognizing the symptoms of CLI  considering the diagnosis in patients with risk factors such as diabetes  smoking  age over 70  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease history  gaining an understanding of different diagnostic techniques  and devising a comprehensive management plan. The case also emphasizes the interrelationship between lifestyle habits  chronic medical conditions  and the incidence and progression of CLI.   Notes:  Critical limb ischemia prevalence varies across different ethnicities. It is relatively high among Hispanics as they are at a higher risk of diabetes  a major risk factor for CLI. Also  the condition is more common in males and those aged over 70. Therefore  using a 72-year-old Hispanic male for this case helps represent accurate demographics as seen in clinical settings and epidemiological data. 
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,83,Patient Information:  Mr. Hugh Wilson  a 67-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  presents at the outpatient department (OPD).  Demographics:  Mr. Wilson is a lifelong resident of Detroit  Michigan. He is a widower living alone and has three adult children. He is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago  but admits to a history of heavy alcohol use in the past.  Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a long-standing history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are relatively well-controlled with medication. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago and underwent a right femoral-popliteal bypass surgery 4 years back. He is currently on medication for his hypertension (amlodipine 5mg daily) and for his type 2 diabetes (metformin 500mg twice daily). He also takes an aspirin (81mg) daily as advised by his cardiologist.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Wilson reports increasing pain in his right lower leg  primarily in the calf  for the past three weeks. The pain  first intermittent  has now become constant. It increases while walking (even short distances of less than a block) and during rest  and has been waking him up at night. He also mentions about a non-healing wound on his right foot which has been there for the past three weeks  despite regular dressing and topical antibiotic ointments. Additionally  he complains of increased coldness of his right foot and decreased sensation compared to his left. He denies any chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  This clinical scenario represents a common case of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the most severe stage of PAD  disproportionately affecting older adults  especially those from African-American ethnicity  with smoking history and poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. It illustrates the common patient's profile  risk factors  and symptoms that medical students should look for when approaching a patient with PAD. The training case will provide an opportunity for students to identify and manage CLI  considering its complications and the crucial role of interdisciplinary treatment.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,84,Patient Information:  Mr. Jose Garcia  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  retired construction worker  currently residing in Albuquerque  New Mexico.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Garcia has a history of Type 2 diabetes  which has been generally controlled with oral medication for 15 years. He also has hypertension managed with medication  and a 40-pack-year smoking history  although he quit smoking 10 years ago. He is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Garcia presents to the clinic with complaints of increasing pain in his right lower limb over the previous three months. The discomfort  according to Mr. Garcia  begins in his hip and shoots down his leg to his foot. He describes the sensation as a persistent throbbing and cramping pain  which intensifies when he walks a short distance and slightly lessens when he is resting  but never completely disappears.  Furthermore  he has noticed that his right foot often feels extremely cold. He also noted some sores on his lower right leg and foot that have not healed for weeks. The pain has begun to interfere with his sleep and activities of daily living  and over-the-counter pain relievers do not provide significant relief.  This case illustrates critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe manifestation of Peripheral Artery Disease. As a medical educator  this case can be used to train medical students on the clinical manifestations  diagnostic approaches  and management strategies related to CLI. They can learn from Mr. Garcia's history  presenting complaints  investigations (like ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  angiography)  leading to the correct diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical  surgical  or endovascular treatments). The students should also understand the risk factors and preventative strategies  as well as the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in caring for such patients.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,85,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. L  a 78-year-old African-American male from a rural setting  with an annual income level of less than $20 000  living alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. L is a known case of Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  and hypertension for around 10 years  both of which he mentions are poorly controlled due to inconsistent medications compliance. Moreover  he has been a heavy smoker for the past 45 years  consuming about a pack of cigarettes per day. In his records  he has a documented history of a myocardial infarction 3 years back. He also reports a moderate alcohol intake.  Key Complaints: For the past 3 months  Mr. L has been suffering from a progressive claudication  which initially started in his right calf  eventually involving both the legs up to the thigh. More recently  he experienced a sharp pain at rest  primarily in his feet  disturbing his sleep significantly. Over the past week  he noticed a non-healing ulcer over his right big toe.  Discussion: This case is a classic presentation of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  typically seen in elderly males  particularly in African-Americans  and subjects with low socioeconomic status. Risk factors for CLI include long-standing poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension  a history of ischemic heart disease  smoking and limited access to healthcare services. The escalating pattern of symptoms is characteristic  starting with exertional leg pain (claudication)  proceeding to pain at rest  and eventually leading to tissue loss manifesting as skin ulcers or gangrene. This case's purpose is to train students on identifying CLI's typical presentation  understand the associated risk factors and the need for an urgent management approach to prevent limb loss.   Literature emphasizes that critical limb ischemia  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries and drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores  disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities  particularly African-Americans.

Critical Limb Ischemia,10,86,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischaemia  Patient Information:   Mr. Alvarez is a 70-year-old Hispanic male  residing in a suburban neighborhood. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Alvarez has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus which was diagnosed 12 years ago. He has been adherent to metformin. He also has a history of hypertension  managed by lisinopril and amlodipine  and had an MI 5 years ago. He is a former 2 pack/day smoker for 30 years  but quit following his heart attack. He does not drink alcohol. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had a stroke in his late 60s.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Alvarez presents with a six-month history of intermittent claudication while trying to walk his dog  sometimes resulting in him having to stop and rest due to the pain. This has been progressively worsening over the last month and he has now started experiencing rest pain  especially at night. Additionally  he complains of non-healing ulcers on the toes of his right foot. He denies trauma to the limb or fever  but admits to some night sweats.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his right foot appears pale  with noticeable calf muscle wasting. His foot is cold to touch and painful. Pedal pulses are not palpable bilaterally. There are large ulcers on his distal phalanges which are blackened showing signs of necrosis. His left foot  while not as severe  appears cyanotic on dependency and erythematous upon elevation.  While this is a synthetic case  it is crucial to acknowledge real-world statistics; CLI is more common in patients over 60 years old and males are twice as likely to have peripheral arterial disease (PAD). As per the literature  most patients with CLI have a smoking history  diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. At the same time  the Hispanic population has a higher prevalence of diabetes and lesser access to healthcare  which may delay presentation. Therefore  this case is a representative model to simulate real-world situations.   Following discussions of this variant with the students  the training can progress to diagnostic measures  treatment options  and discussions on preventative measures. It is important to emphasize a multi-disciplinary approach involving cardiologists  vascular surgeons  diabetologists  and wound care specialists.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,87,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Juan Fernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of severe pain in his left leg  particularly coupled with activity or movement. The pain  which starts in his calf  is sharp and radiating  leaving his foot numb and cold. He reports nighttime pain that often wakes him up. His sleep position does not seem to offer any relief  forcing him to often rest with his leg dangling over the bed.  Mr. Fernandez is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. He is an ex-smoker  having quit ten years back after a 30-year history of smoking a pack daily.   He has a past medical history of Hypertension managed with lifestyle changes and medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily)  Type 2 Diabetes well-controlled with metformin  and had a heart bypass surgery 8 years prior. He also recently noticed an open sore on his calf that has been slowly spreading and not healing. He reports no allergies.  Family history reveals that his father passed away due to a heart attack at age 70  and his mother had suffered from Type 2 diabetes and died at age 75 due to complication of the disease. His only sibling  an older brother  suffers from chronic kidney disease.  Initial Impression:   The patient’s complaint of severe pain  especially during the night  paired with a non-healing ulcer on his leg  and his background of atherosclerotic risk factors (smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  and cardiac disease) results in the initial suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Considering that high rates of CLI are reported in elderly Hispanic populations with multiple risk factors  Mr. Fernandez's situation is a representative case. Thus  when teaching with this case  one needs to recognize the various complex considerations necessary while diagnosing and planning the treatment for these patients.   Next steps should include further diagnostic testing  particularly an Ankle-Brachial Index  imaging of the affected limb  and  considering his past medical history  a cardiovascular risk assessment. As well  it's important to plan for an interdisciplinary approach to manage his chronic diseases and CLI  if confirmed.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,88,Patient Demographics: Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  poorly controlled 2. Hypertension 3. Coronary artery disease with previous Myocardial Infarction (MI)  2 years ago 4. Former smoker  quit smoking 2 years ago after the MI 5. Hyperlipidemia  Chief Complaint:  The patient presents with a complaint of a progressively worsening pain in his right lower leg over the last three months. He describes the pain as severe  persistent and worsening with walking  improving with rest. Lately  he has been experiencing pain even at rest  especially at night. He notes that the pain is associated with a feeling of coldness in his foot  along with noticed color changes described as pallor  which turns dusky when he lowers his leg. Also  reports noticeable wound on leg that has not healed in the past two weeks.  Additional Details: On physical examination  the patient's right lower leg is noted to be cooler than the left. The right foot is pale  with weak or absent pulses  confirmed by Arterial Doppler Study. Cutaneous changes are observed including shiny skin and loss of hair. A non-healing ulterior wound is observed on his right foot. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) shows a value of less than 0.4 which suggests severe arterial disease. His blood pressure is recorded as 145/85 mm Hg  fasting blood glucose as 180mg/dl  and HbA1C as 8%.  This case is designed to represent a mix of common risk factors and demographics usually associated with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) including advanced age  male gender  African-American race  diabetes  smoking  hypertension  coronary artery disease  and an ABI indicative of severe peripheral arterial disease. It is meant to illustrate a common presentation of CLI to help medical students develop an understanding of the progression of the disease  diagnosis  and management options.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,89,Patient Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. James Fernandez  Age: 68 years old  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Gender: Male  Residency: Urban residence  Arizona  U.S Occupation: Retired School Principal Marital Status: Widower   Past Medical History: - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years  adequately controlled with Metformin. - Hypertension for 20 years  managed with Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide. - Current smoker with a 45 pack-year history. - Past history of coronary artery disease with successful angioplasty 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with severe  recurrent pain in the right lower limb  which is worse on exercise and sometimes occurring at rest. He has also noticed a non-healing ulcer developing on his right big toe and mentioned his foot is strangely cold. Mr. Fernandez reported having intermittent claudication approximately three months ago  starting after walking less than a block  which relieved upon rest. He noticed progression of his symptoms with the intermittent claudication happening earlier during his walks and finally  the development of pain at rest. On further probing  he also revealed experiencing unintentional weight loss over the past few months.  The inclusion of ethnic diversity  aging population  pertinent past medical history  including controllable factors like smoking and hypertension  and the symptomology makes this an educative case for critical limb ischemia that aligns with common patient characteristics as found in the literature. This case study should facilitate effective learning about risk factor management  symptom progression  and the resulting impact on the physical state (ulcer development and weight loss)  aiding in shaping a thorough understanding of critical limb ischemia.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,90,Case Summary:  Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male.  Past Medical History: He is obese  with a BMI of 30  and a long-time smoker. His medical history includes long-standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (inconsistent glycemic control)  Hypertension  and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez presents with a six-month history of progressive lower limb pain  which had been previously mistaken for neuropathy due to his diabetes. Recently  there was a change in quality of the pain where it now persistently aches even at rest particularly in his right foot. He also reports the development of non-healing sores on the right foot  mainly on his heel and big toe.  On Physical Examination: His right foot appears pale  with weak distal pulses. On closer inspection  the sores on his foot are evident with minor necrotic changes  suggesting long-standing inadequate blood supply. There are no signs of infection.  This case has been designed to reflect the typical demographic affected by Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  commonly seen in the elderly population with a history of smoking  diabetes  and PAD. It provides an opportunity for students to assess and manage a patient with CLI  with attention to the critical nature of this condition  the importance of detailed history taking  thorough physical examination  and the need for prompt intervention. The case also highlights the significant contribution of risk factors to the development of CLI  emphasizing the importance of preventive measures in at-risk populations.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,91,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mrs. M is a 67-year-old African-American woman  a retired school teacher  resident of a mid-sized Midwestern city.  Past Medical History:   Mrs. M has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus which has been inconsistently controlled. She also has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which she has been taking medication. Mrs. M is overweight with a BMI of 32 and has been a smoker for around 40 years. She has no documented history of any previous vascular disease.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient came to the emergency department complaining of severe pain in her left foot  persisting even during rest. The pain seems to have increased over the course of two weeks  and she describes it as a sharp  burning sensation that mostly worsens at night. Mrs. M also reports skin changes on the left lower limb- it appears shiny and is losing hair. In addition  she mentions intermittent claudication (i.e.  muscle pain during physical exercise which relieves upon rest) and recently noticed a non-healing ulcer on her left big toe.  Course of Action:   This case addressing critical limb ischemia necessitates urgent evaluation and treatment planning by the clinical team which could encompass diagnostics such as an Ankle-Brachial Index test  Doppler ultrasound  Angiography  or Magnetic Resonance Angiography. In terms of the management plan  medical students should consider her comorbidities and the importance of interdisciplinary consultation  taking into account diabetes management  nutritional support  and smoking cessation. The severe nature of her ischemia and non-healing ulcer may warrant the discussion of both endovascular and surgical revascularization procedures to restore limb perfusion.   This case exemplifies how socially and medically complex vascular patients can be  as they often present with comorbid conditions that make treatment decisions and procedures more challenging. In Mrs. M’s case  students will navigate the complexities of managing her immediate ischemic symptoms along with her diabetes  smoking addiction  and other risk factors.   Demographical Note:  The selection of an African-American woman for this case scenario takes into account research based demographic evidence that shows African-Americans tend to have higher prevalence rates of peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia. Similarly  gender disparity is noted in the field of vascular care  with women often being diagnosed later and receiving different treatments than men. Through this case  students can also discuss the influence of social determinants of health and their impact on patient outcomes.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,92,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Information: Mr. Alvarez  a 74-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic. He is a retired construction worker now living with his wife  spending his retirement in gardening and occasional fishing.  Past Medical History: Mr. Alvarez has a history of poorly controlled Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 15 years. He is a former smoker  quitting about 8 years ago but had a pack-a-day habit for 40 years prior. He has no history of surgeries. His medications include Metformin  Glipizide  Lisinopril  and Aspirin. His mother had a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and the patient has not been previously diagnosed or evaluated for PAD.  Complaints: Mr. Alvarez describes a continuous and intensifying pain in his right calf  which he initially thought was a muscle pull. He reported that the pain started about four weeks ago  and exacerbates during his gardening or while walking even short distances  which he finds peculiar as he used to be highly physically active. He also mentions the persistence of pain even at rest  mainly in the night that even awakes him from sleep.   On physical examination: He appeared anxious and reported weight loss. His right lower leg was discolored  noticeably cooler and had diminished pulses when compared with the left. On further examination  there were hard-to-heal ulcers observed on his right heel and toe.   This case report is designed with a focus on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The given symptoms and observation point towards CLI  which is a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease  more commonly seen in elderly patients with a history of diabetes and smoking. The demographics represented  i.e.  a Hispanic elderly male is consistent with literature  reporting higher rates of CLI in people of color and males.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,93,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired Construction worker  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a 20-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history  but he stopped smoking 10 years ago. In addition  he suffers from hypercholesterolemia and had a mild myocardial infarction eight years back  managed by angioplasty.  Chief Complaints: Over the last two months  John has noticed increasing discomfort  heaviness  and cramping in his right calf  especially after walking a few blocks  which relieve at rest (intermittent claudication). Recently  he has been experiencing notable pain in his foot even at rest  disturbing his sleep. He also mentions that his right foot feels significantly colder as compared to his left and has developed a non-healing sore on his right big toe  which is not improving despite his attempts of care at home.  This brief synopsis sets the stage for the trainees to discuss critical limb ischemia  its risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and hypercholesterolemia  and complications of peripheral arterial disease. Further  students should be asked to discuss the difference between intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia  the importance of examining peripheral pulses and the consequences of delayed or inadequate treatment.  Note: The reason for choosing an elderly African-American male patient is that literature suggests critical limb ischemia is more common among men and the prevalence is higher among the black population due to their higher risk of peripheral arterial disease  diabetes  and smoking.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,94,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Demographics: Patient: Mrs. Rosa Gonzalez Age: 65 years old Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Diagnosed 15 years ago  managed with Metformin. 2. Hypertension - Diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Lisinopril. 3. Dyslipidemia - Diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Atorvastatin. 4. Atherosclerosis - Diagnosed 5 years ago. 5. Ex-smoker – quit 3 years ago. 6. No history of coronary artery disease or stroke.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Gonzalez's primary complaint includes progressive worsening of pain in her left leg over the past six months. The pain starts in her calf and often extends to her foot. She reports exacerbation of pain during walking  which is relieved by rest (Intermittent claudication). Recently  she has been experiencing rest pain  primarily at night  disturbing her sleep. She has to hang her feet over the bed for pain relief (Ischemic rest pain). Last week  she noticed a non-healing ulcer over the top of her left foot.  Physical examinations revealed a healed ulcer scar on the right toe and markedly decreased temperature and absence of pulse (Popliteal  Dorsalis Pedis  Posterior Tibialis) in the left lower limb. Her ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly reduced (<0.4)  pointing towards CLI.  In this case  Mrs. Gonzalez  a postmenopausal Hispanic woman in her mid-sixties with a past medical history significant for diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia represents a typical patient diagnosed with CLI. Her symptoms include leg pain (intermittent claudication and ischemic rest pain) and non-healing foot ulcers  all typical aspects of CLI progression. Inferring CLI in her case is further solidified due to her demographic relevance - individuals with diabetes and over sixty years of age are known to have an increased risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and consequent CLI.  It is of clinical significance that Mrs. Gonzalez is a Hispanic woman  as studies show PAD is more common among Hispanics than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Also  women with PAD often have more atypical symptoms and are underdiagnosed  leading to high rates of limb loss and mortality  which makes early recognition and appropriate management crucial.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,95,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 70-year-old African American male  residing in an urban community  who is retired from a job that involved significant periods of prolonged sitting.  Past Medical History: The patient has a long history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has a 40-year history of smoking two packs per day but quit 10 years ago. He used to be moderately obese but has lost some weight in the past few years.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the clinic with intermittent claudication that has progressed over the past few months. Initially  it was a discomfort in the right lower leg upon walking a few blocks  but it has gradually increased  forcing the patient to rest multiple times even during short walks. The patient also presented with a non-healing ulcer on the right foot along with continuous rest pain  which significantly worsens at night. He also stated that his toes often appeared bluish  especially after walking a certain distance.  Discussion: These symptoms are suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  which is particularly prevalent among populations with high rates of smoking and diabetes  like the subject of our case study. CLI is often a late manifestation of peripheral arterial disease  which this patient is at high risk of due to his long history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes alongside the past history of smoking. This training case has been built to acknowledge the reality of CLI prevalence among older  African American populations with such comorbidities.   As future medical practitioners  learners will need to assess patients accurately for the early signs of CLI and manage it effectively to prevent its serious complications  such as limb loss  cardiovascular events  and death. This case will help medical students in honing their skills to diagnose  manage  and prevent this dangerous condition.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,96,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Identification Information:  Mr. Santiago  a 68-year-old Hispanic male.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Santiago has a known history of Type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed around six years back. He is a former smoker  quit smoking seven years ago after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There’s a family history of coronary artery disease as well.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Santiago presented to the clinic with severe pain in his right lower extremity. He informed that the pain has been there for several weeks but has gotten worse over the past couple of days. He also stated that the pain wakes him up from sleep. He reported that the pain is usually relieved by hanging his leg off the side of the bed.  He described the pain as “aching” and “burning” in nature  localized mostly in his foot and calf. In addition to pain  he mentioned his right foot feels much colder than the left one and voiced concern about the change in color and the presence of non-healing sores on his foot. His symptoms have made it difficult for him to walk or participate in daily activities.  Mr. Santiago also voiced concern about the implications these symptoms may have on his independence and ability to look after his wife  who has been suffering from dementia.   Note:  Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI) is mainly found in older adults  specifically males. Long-term smoking  diabetes  and PAD frequently appear as risk factors. Hispanics are expected to represent 25% of the total U.S. population by 2045  hence the need for better representation in medical case studies. CLI not only affects the patient's physical health but can significantly impair their mental and emotional well-being due to reduced mobility and independence.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,97,Case Report  Patient Information:   Patient Name: (Patient X)  Age: 69 Sex: Male Race: African-American Occupation: Retired machinist Residence: Urban area   Past Medical History: - Hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago managed with meds - Type II Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago - Current Smoker – 20 cigarettes per day for 35 years - Hyperlipidemia - Brief episode of angina pectoris 6 years ago  resolved without intervention  Presenting Complaint: The patient has reported increasing discomfort in his right lower leg characterized by cramping and pain  especially after walking a certain distance  about a block (claudication). Patient notes this has been increasing in frequency over the past few months. The pain resolves upon rest but recurs sooner upon resuming activity. In the past week  he has also noticed non-healing sores on his right foot and toes. The patient has noticed that his right foot feels colder than his left and appears discolored  taking a pale hue when he elevates it and dark reddish-brown when in a dependent position. The patient denies any fever  recent trauma  or weight loss.  This case scenario represents a typical high-risk demographic for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). It involves a 69-year-old African-American male who is a long-term smoker and suffers from multiple comorbidities including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and DM Type II. The American Heart Association describes CLI as a severe blockage in the arteries which drastically reduces blood-flow leading to severe pain  sores  or even gangrene. The patient presentation is suggestive of advanced peripheral arterial disease which could progress to CLI.    Prompt  effective diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent severe outcomes. An understanding of the risk factors for peripheral artery disease and CLI is important  as well as the clinical picture which includes progressive claudication  non-healing wounds  and rest pain.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,98,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Richards  a 68-year old Caucasian male  retired locomotive engineer relies on public transportation. He lives alone in a suburban community and lacks immediate family support. He smokes a half pack of cigarettes a day  a habit he started at 18. He frequently uses alcohol  and his diet is dominated by processed food. He was referred to the clinic after a healthcare visit for routine check-up revealed some worrying symptoms. He falls within the socio-economic group where unhealthy lifestyle is rampant  further complicated by limited mobility due to his job nature.  Past Medical History: Mr. Richards has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes  diagnosed at 48. Complications include early stage kidney damage and sensory peripheral neuropathy. On top of that  he has been battling hypertension and hyperlipidemia for 2 decades. His condition is complicated by intermittent claudication with coldness of his left foot and reports that any physical activity has lately been challenging due to muscle weakness and fatigue. Despite multiple interventions to aid smoking cessation  he's been unsuccessful in quitting his smoking habit. His medication includes Metformin  an ACE inhibitor and a Statin.  Key Complaints: Over the last month  Mr. Richards complained of a progressive worsening of consistent rest pain in his left foot. The pain is described as severe and sharp  distributing in the plantar area  and often gets worse at night. He describes it as a “burning” type of pain that is more severe when his leg is elevated  especially in bed at night. He also noted an ulcer on his left big toe that fails to show any signs of healing since two weeks. Additionally  he reports a history of claudication after walking only a few blocks  but that the pain disappears with rest. The pain has interrupted his sleep  leading to insomnia and associated fatigue.  This case reveals a classic presentation of a patient with probable critical limb ischemia (CLI)  characterized by chronic pain at rest  non-healing wounds on the foot  and the feeling of cold in the foot. The symptomology warrants requisite medical evaluation for CLI and the formulation of a suitable treatment plan.
Critical Limb Ischemia,10,99,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Details: Name: Mrs. Linda Johnson Age: 68 years Race: African-American Sex: Female  Chief Complaints: Mrs. Johnson reports a 3-month history of progressive pain in her right lower leg. The pain is intense during walking and reduces when she rests (claudication). Recently  she has also been experiencing pain at rest  particularly at night. The pain often disrupts her sleep and is relieved by hanging her leg off the side of the bed. She has also noted that her right foot appears pale and cold.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a 10-year history of Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. She has been a smoker for many years but quit 2 years ago. She had a transient ischemic attack 5 years ago but has had no residual neurological issues since. Family history reveals her father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.   Physical Findings: Examination of her lower limbs revealed decreased temperature in the right foot  reduced popliteal and femoral pulses  and absence of both posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right side. Her right foot appeared pale  particularly when elevated. Capillary refill time was delayed to over 3 seconds in her right foot.   This case has been designed in consideration of the demographic trends for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI). The incidence of PAD and CLI is higher in the African-American population  and CLI is more common in women compared to men of the same age category. Furthermore  this patient's risk factors including smoking  diabetes  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a family history of cardiovascular disease serve to emphasize the multiplicity of factors often present in those suffering from CLI.
