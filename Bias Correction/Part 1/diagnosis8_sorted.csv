The patient reports calf pain worsened by standing and walking. He denies any recent trauma  surgery  or prolonged periods of immobilization. The pain is non-radiating  and there is no associated fever  shortness of breath  chest pain  or palpitations.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a past medical history significant for Stage II hypertension  Type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He underwent a partial colectomy for colon cancer five years ago and has since been cancer-free. He has a 40-pack year smoking history but quit two years ago.  Medications:  1. Metformin 500mg twice a day 2. Amlodipine 5mg once daily 3. Atorvastatin 20mg once daily  Family History: His mother died from a myocardial infarction and his father from stroke. Both parents had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His older brother has type 2 diabetes.   Social History: He lives with his wife and has three children. He is a former smoker  with a history of heavy smoking (40 pack-years). He reports moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks per day) and denies illicit drug use. He is retired and reports leading a typically sedentary lifestyle.  This patient's demographic details and clinical picture align with the representation found in literature for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Aging  sedentary lifestyle  personal and family history of vascular diseases  and smoking all contribute to increased risk.   It is crucial to interpret these symptoms in the context of risk factors  and immediate diagnostics should be pursued due to the potential for life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism. It will be imperative to educate Mr. Johnson about potential changes in lifestyle and medication regimen depending upon the confirmation and severity of his diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,2,Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Today  we are discussing Mr. Thomas T. Anderson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with symptoms suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Mr. Anderson is a retired engineer  hailing from a suburban community in Fargo  North Dakota.  Demographic information: Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Fargo  North Dakota  Chief Complaint: Mr. Anderson presented with progressive swelling and pain in his right lower leg that began about two days ago. He reports no recent trauma to the leg. He describes the pain as a continuous  dull ache that intensifies with movement.  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a significant past medical history for hypertension and type II diabetes  both of which are well controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg/day for hypertension; Metformin 1000mg twice daily for Type II Diabetes). Additionally  he has a past history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)  for which he takes daily Aspirin 81mg as a preventive measure.  He underwent right hip arthroplasty 5 years ago. Further  6 months ago  he was admitted to another hospital for pneumonia  where he was treated and discharged without any reported complications.  Social History: Mr. Anderson is a divorced male  with two adult sons residing in another state. He is a former smoker - quit 20 years ago. But he admits to drinking alcohol occasionally  but insists it is moderate and socially.  Risk Factors: Given his age  history of immobility associated with pneumonia hospitalization  orthopedic surgery  and sedentary lifestyle due to retirement  Mr. Anderson is at a marked risk for DVT. Furthermore  his hypertension  diabetes  and history of TIAs cumulatively contribute to his overall increased risk.  Clinical Outlook: A Doppler Ultrasound is planned to directly visualize and confirm if a DVT has occurred. If confirmed  Mr. Anderson would be at risk for developing pulmonary embolism  a feared complication of DVT. An appropriate anticoagulant regime will be initiated aiding thrombus resolution and reducing the risk of embolization. Patient education and lifestyle modifications will form the backbone of his long-term management plan  to prevent recurrence of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,3,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Name: Mr. Steven Harper Age: 60 years-old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Financial Advisor Residence: New York City  NY  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Harper presents with discomfort  swelling  and redness in his right lower leg. He reports having experienced calf pain and light-headedness for the past three days. He mentions having recently undertaken a long-haul flight after a business trip.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Harper has a medical history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but smoked one pack per day for 25 years. He drinks alcohol socially and participates in moderate exercise twice a week.  Family History:  His family history reveals that both his parents had cardiovascular issues. His mother experienced an ischemic stroke at 70 and his father died due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. Given this history  Mr. Harper has been under regular medical supervision for cardiovascular risk assessment  with a significant effort placed on managing his hypertension.  Medications and Allergies:  Apart from Lisinopril for hypertension  Mr. Harper also reports taking aspirin for heart health. He has no known drug allergies.  Discussion:  This demographic information aligns with literature suggesting the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases with age and are more common among Caucasians. This patient's past history of smoking  sedentary occupation  long-haul flight  uncontrolled hypertension  male sex  and family history of cardiovascular disease all indicate a high risk for DVT.   Therefore  based on his symptoms and risk factors  Mr. Harper's clinical presentation is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis  and appropriate diagnostic tests should be ordered to confirm this. Timely detection and treatment are crucial to prevent further complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,4,Title: Patient Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction: Today we will be discussing the case of Mrs. Maria Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female. According to research  the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases with age  and DVT can occur in any race or ethnicity but appears to be slightly more common in individuals of European descent. However  cases among Hispanic populations are not uncommon  and thus  our patient represents a fair demographic representation.  Demographics: Mrs. Lopez is a long-time resident of Los Angeles  California. She is retired and lives with her husband. She is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol use. She is bilingual  speaking both English and Spanish fluently. She has two adult children and four grandchildren.  Medical History: Mrs. Lopez has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which have been well-managed with medication. She also underwent a total knee replacement surgery six months ago and since then  she has been relatively immobile  being most of the time in her house due to her fear of falling. Family history reveals that her father had a stroke at the age of 73  but no known history of any coagulation disorders.  Presenting Issue: Over the past week  Mrs. Lopez has noticed increasing pain and swelling in her right lower leg  prompting her to seek medical attention. Upon physical examination  the calf was warm to the touch  erythematous  swollen  and tender which are common symptoms of DVT.   Given her recent orthopedic surgery and subsequent immobility  Mrs. Lopez would be considered high-risk for the development of a DVT due to prolonged immobilization leading to venous stasis.   Preliminary tests including a Doppler ultrasound are being arranged to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out any possible pulmonary embolism which can be a severe complication of DVT.   Summary: In summary  we have presented the case of Mrs. Lopez  a patient who is at increased risk factors for deep vein thrombosis due to her advanced age  recent knee surgery and subsequent period of immobility. Further diagnostic investigation will confirm the diagnosis and guide the appropriate treatment plan to reduce her risk of complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,5,Title: Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Female Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Our patient  Mrs. Alice Johnson  is a 56-year-old Caucasian female  originally from Chicago  IL  who presented with symptoms indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Slide 2: Demographics and Risk Factors As per literature  DVT is slightly more common in females  with the risk increasing with age. Mrs. Johnson falls under the demographic frequently seen in DVT cases. Furthermore  she is overweight with a BMI of 30  an inactive lifestyle  and a history of long periods of immobility due to her occupation as a software programmer. These factors collectively put her at an elevated risk for developing DVT.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. Johnson's past medical history is significant for smoking and high blood pressure. Additionally  she had undergone hormone replacement therapy post her menopause. This information is critical as these conditions can also contribute towards hypercoagulability  making Mrs. Johnson susceptible to thromboembolic diseases.  Slide 4: Current Presentation Upon presentation  Mrs. Johnson described experiencing progressive discomfort and swelling in her left lower leg for one week. The pain was described as a cramping soreness which increases with physical activity and alleviates with rest. Her calf was tender to touch  with visible redness and warmth on physical examination. No signs of tissue damage or necrosis were observed.  Slide 5: Assessment and Findings A Doppler Ultrasound highlighted an obstructive clot in her left femoral vein  confirming the clinical diagnosis of DVT. Necessary laboratory investigations  including coagulation profile  were ordered. Her D-dimer levels were elevated  a common finding in DVT patients.  Slide 6: Conclusion Given the demographic representation  the patient's lifestyle and medical risk factors  the diagnosis of DVT for Mrs. Johnson is consistent with what is found in the current literature. A thorough assessment  early diagnosis  and a proper treatment plan are vital in managing DVT to prevent severe complications.  Slide 7: Patient Management Currently  Mrs. Johnson is undergoing anticoagulation therapy and has been educated on the need for regular follow-ups  lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes  regular exercise  cessation of smoking  managing her blood pressure  and reducing prolonged periods of inactivity.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,6,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Presentation  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female  named Ms. Smith  from a middle-class socio-economic background. She is statistically the most common demographic for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  according to existing literature. She is a non-smoker but has a sedentary lifestyle due to her profession as an editor at a publishing firm.

His blood pressure control has been excellent on his current regime of Lisinopril and Amlodipine. His most recent lipid levels were excellent.  He was recently hospitalized for hernia repair three weeks ago  for which he received prophylactic subcutaneous Heparin  as per protocol.   Family History: Mr. Smith reports his father had a pulmonary embolism in his 80s.  Summary:  This portrait of Mr. Smith takes into account both WHO and CDC demographics. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevalence trends show increased susceptibility with age  particularly in Caucasian individuals. Other risk factors include obesity  post-surgery periods  and prolonged immobilization. His significant family history and past cardiovascular health issues make his case noteworthy. As smoking also increases the risk of DVT  the patient’s former lifestyle is noteworthy; despite having quit  his risk may still be increased based on his past consumption. Mr. Smith's case highlights the importance of considering risk factors  demographics  and lifestyle factors in the possibility of developing deep vein thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,14,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Initials: L. J.  Age: 62  Sex: Female  Race/Ethnicity: African American  Occupation: Retired Physical Education Teacher  Presenting Condition: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Medical History:  The patient is a 62-year-old postmenopausal African American female  nonsmoker  with a past medical history of obesity (BMI 33)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  not previously diagnosed with any thrombotic or coagulation disorder. The patient had an uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty six weeks ago.   Current Medications:  - Lisinopril for hypertension - Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  Presenting Complaint:  L. J. came to the hospital complaining of a gradually worsening and persistent pain in her right calf over the past four days  associated with visible swelling and slight redness. She also reported a sensation of warmth in the same area. She denied any shortness of breath  chest pain  or recent long travels.  Physical Examination:  Mild distress due to lower extremity pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cardiovascular exam reveals well-preserved peripheral pulses without any signs of peripheral ischemia. The right lower extremity appears markedly swollen  erythematous  and is warm to touch. Dorsiflexion of the foot elicits calf discomfort (positive Homan’s sign). No ulcers or skin changes  and the remaining physical exam is nondescript.  This patient’s symptoms  recent knee surgery  uncontrolled hypertension  and hyperlipidemia increase her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Given her symptoms and risk factors  it would be reasonable for further investigation with duplex ultrasonography or D-dimer testing to confirm the suspected diagnosis of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,15,Title: Presentation of a Deep Vein Thrombosis Patient  Patient Details: Name: John Rodriguez Age: 57 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Law Enforcement Officer Location: Miami  USA  Overview: John is a Cuban-American middle-aged male  a demographic that is vulnerable to Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) due to lifestyle factors. John has been leading a sedentary lifestyle further aggravated by his long work hours and extensive seated periods  raising his risk of developing DVT.  Past Medical History: John has an established history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. He has been adherent to his antihypertensive and statin medications. He smokes around ten cigarettes a day for about 20 years  which has compounded his DVT risk. He is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 5 years ago and managed well on oral hypoglycemic agents. There is no family history of coagulation disorders.  Presenting Symptoms: John sought medical intervention following pain and swelling in his left leg that had become progressively worse over a week. He also reported experiencing lower leg discomfort while walking. There were no reported symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath or coughing up blood  which could point towards a pulmonary embolism.   Conclusion: Given John is above 50 years of age with a routine lifestyle involving prolonged periods of immobility and a history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  he is at increased risk of DVT. Upon physical examination  the left leg was visibly swollen and warmer to touch compared to the right. D-dimer lab test and a duplex ultrasounds were recommended to confirm the DVT diagnosis.  This patient presentation demonstrates how deep vein thrombosis tends to manifest among middle-aged  sedentary individuals with underlying chronic conditions and unhealthy habits. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism.   References: (Refer to the most recent publications on Deep Vein Thrombosis presentations and implications on middle-aged  Hispanic men with underlying chronic conditions and lifestyles).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,16,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis Case Presentation   I. Patient Demographics  The patient being discussed is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who hails from a semi-urban community in Nebraska. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband of 40 years. She has a sedentary lifestyle since retirement and she is a non-smoker. No known drug allergies.  II. Medical History  The patient has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32  and hypertension  for which she is currently on Lisinopril 10mg once daily. She is also currently managing type 2 diabetes mellitus with Metformin. She visited the emergency department 3 weeks ago for a total knee replacement surgery.  III. Patient Symptoms  Four days ago  she started feeling pain and tenderness in her right calf  which has progressively gotten worse. She is also reporting moderate swelling and the skin around the area is noticeably warmer and oddly discolored (reddish). There is no reported fever but she has been feeling fatigued for the last couple of days. No reported shortness of breath or chest pain.  IV. Preliminary Diagnosis  Considering the recent orthopedic surgery  her sedentary lifestyle  and her history of obesity and hypertension  her symptoms suggest the possibility of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The calf pain  swelling  warmth  and discoloration are classic signs of DVT  though further diagnostic tests are required to confirm the diagnosis.  V. Literature Prevalence  According to available literature  the risk factors for DVT include major surgery  prolonged immobility  obesity  advanced age (over 60 years)  and medical conditions like cancer  heart and lung diseases  and inflammatory bowel diseases. Women are slightly more likely than men to develop DVT  and Caucasians are found to have a higher prevalence compared to other races.  It is crucial to note that this presentation represents a typical DVT patient as highlighted in the scientific literature. Final diagnosis and treatment will be based on further diagnostic tests and the patient's response to treatment. As Healthcare Providers  ensuring all variables are considered is essential in patient management.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,17,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in Postmenopausal Women  Patient Presentation:  Ms. Sarah Johansson  a 58-year-old Caucasian female  presents with recent complaints of swelling and pain in her right lower extremity  specifically the calf region  which she has been experiencing for the past few days. As an office administrative assistant  her occupation involves prolonged sitting. She had menopause at age 50 and is currently on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).   Patient History:  Her past medical history reveals that she is a long-term smoker  consuming about a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She has no history of alcohol or drug abuse. She has a history of Hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications. She has a family history of thromboembolic diseases – her mother had a pulmonary embolism in her late sixties.  Her BMI is 28 indicating overweight  and her diet is typically high in saturated fats. She reports leading a sedentary lifestyle  having little to no regular physical exercise. She reports no known drug allergies. She had a surgical history of hysterectomy done 2 years ago due to fibroids.  On Physical Examination:  Her vital signs are stable. Examination of the right lower extremity reveals erythematous  warm  swollen  and tender calf which is positive for Homan's sign. There are no signs of superficial vein inflammation.   Based on the history and physical examination  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is suspected. A Doppler ultrasound is advised to confirm the diagnosis and establish the extent of the thrombosis.   Discussion:  Ms. Johansson presents classic circumstances for the development of DVT. Postmenopausal women  particularly those on HRT  have an increased risk of DVT. Her sedentary job  smoking history  and family history of thromboembolic diseases all elevate her risk.   Research indicates that Caucasian individuals have a higher proclivity for DVT compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Hypertension  obesity  and consumption of a diet rich in saturated fat also contribute to her risk. Furthermore  her age group (50-60 years old) is when the occurrence of VTE (Venous Thromboembolism) starts to significantly escalate. Careful consideration of her case is critical in preventing possible severe consequences of untreated DVT  such as a pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,18,"Patient Presentation:  Today I am presenting a 60-year-old  African-American female patient named Mrs. T. According to current literature  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has a higher prevalence among African Americans  particularly older females. Mrs. T. weighs 195 lbs. and has a height of 5’4’’  indicating her BMI falls into the """"obesity"""" range which increases the risk for DVT.  Mrs. T. is a retired school teacher who complains of experiencing persistent unexplained pain and swelling in her left lower leg over the past week. She has noticed that her leg has changed colors to a reddish-blue and feels warm to the touch. She denies experiencing any chest pain  shortness of breath or cardiac symptoms.  Mrs. T. has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type II diabetes and has been on hormone replacement therapy for the past seven years following her menopause. She recently had a total knee replacement surgery on her right leg about six weeks ago. According to her pharmaceutical records  Mrs. T. was regularly taking Metformin  Lisinopril and Prempro  and finished a course of Ibuprofen prescribed post-surgery.  According to the National Blood Clot Alliance  patients with a recent major surgery  especially orthopedic surgeries  have an increased risk of developing DVT. Elevated risk is also associated with hormone replacement therapy  hypertension  and diabetes.  Mrs. T. does not smoke tobacco and consumes alcohol on rare social occasions. She admits to a fairly sedentary life since her retirement and her recent knee surgery  and claims to have a diet high in processed foods.  In conclusion  Mrs. T.’s demographic profile  past medical history  recent surgery  prolonged inactivity  obesity and current symptoms collectively suggest a high risk for deep vein thrombosis. More diagnostic tests are required to confirm this preliminary diagnosis.  In light of her symptoms and risk factors  steps must be taken to facilitate rapid diagnosis and appropriate management to mitigate the associated risk of a pulmonary embolism or other vascular complications."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,19,Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 67 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Location: Colorado  USA  Presentation: Mr. Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presents with unilateral swelling  tenderness  and redness in his left lower extremity. He reports being physically inactive due to the recent snowstorms in Colorado. His mobility was further reduced due to a slight fall about three weeks ago when he sustained a minor fracture in his right foot  which is now on the mend. Notably  Mr. Smith  who recently retired from a sedentary job as an engineer  has a BMI of 30 kg/m2 and is classified as obese.  History: On enquiry  Mr. Smith admits to occasional episodes of chest discomfort and shortness of breath. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72  while his elder brother was diagnosed with DVT at the age of 65.   Mr. Smith also admits to being a smoker for around 30 years  although he has tried to cut back in the last couple of years. He enjoys an occasional glass of wine but denies any substance abuse. He has been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is controlled by medication. His lipid profile indicates borderline high levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL)  suggestive of dyslipidemia.  In Summary: Based on his age  gender  and race  Mr. Smith belongs to a demographic that is commonly affected by DVT  as documented in various studies. His recent physical inactivity due to his injury and extreme weather conditions  obesity  history of smoking  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and positive family history of heart disease and DVT  considerably increases his risk of developing DVT. Evaluation and management strategies should be considered keeping these risk factors in mind  and treatment should be initiated promptly to reduce the risk of potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.      This case presentation is an excellent opportunity to educate and discuss strategies for DVT prevention in high-risk individuals  along with the importance of managing modifiable risk factors such as obesity  smoking  physical inactivity  and hypertension.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,20,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 56-year-old Caucasian male  employed as an IT professional  has shown up at the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of pain and swelling in his right lower leg. Mr. Smith lives in a suburban area in New York  lives alone  and has no dependent children. He is a former smoker but quit about five years ago. He is moderate in alcohol  with occasional indulgence during social events. He reports not having any recent travels or periods of prolonged immobility.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  controlled with medications. He also had a myocardial infarction three years ago for which he underwent an angioplasty  and since then  has been on cardiovascular medications  including antiplatelets. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus two years ago and since then  he has been taking metformin. He also reports a family history of blood clotting disorders. His father suffered from deep vein thrombosis and his mother developed a pulmonary embolism.    Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith complains of increasing pain  swelling  and warmth over his right calf for the past three days. He denied any trauma to the leg  abdominal or chest pains  dyspnea  hemoptysis or neurological deficits. He has noticed the swelling is increasing in size; however  he avoided medical attention until the pain became severe today. He also notes an uncomfortable throbbing sensation  and that the pain gets worse when bending his foot.   The information available displays a clear grouping of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis such as age  sedentary lifestyle associated with his profession  history of myocardial infarction  hypertension  and diabetes. His familial history of blood clotting disorders cannot be disregarded. Considering these  the pain and swelling around the right calf could be indicative of deep vein thrombosis; however  further diagnostic tests and investigations are needed before a definitive conclusion is drawn.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,21,Slide 1: Patient Presentation We're discussing Mr. John Evans  a 65-year-old African American male who presents with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a notable health concern due to its complication  pulmonary embolism  which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Although DVT affects people of all races  studies show that Black individuals have a higher incidence rate  reflecting Mr. Evans' demographic background.   Slide 2: Medical History Mr. Evans has a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus  both of which are quite prevalent in the African American community. He is a former smoker who quit smoking five years ago after a 40-year pack-a-day habit.   Slide 3: Recent History Mr. Evans recently underwent a total hip replacement six weeks ago and noticed the problem started a week after the surgery when a swelling appeared on his right leg  accompanied by moderate pain. The surgery is relevant as immobility is a common risk factor for DVT.  Slide 4: Current Status Currently  Mr. Evans experiences increased right leg swelling compared to his left. He also notes mild-to-moderate pain on the right side  which becomes severe upon walking or standing. He does not report shortness of breath  chest pain  or symptoms reflective of a possible pulmonary embolism  reducing the immediate risk of life-threatening complications.   Slide 5: Conclusion In summary  Mr. Evans is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presenting with symptoms of DVT likely post-op from hip replacement surgery. His demographic background and recent immobility put him at a higher risk of experiencing this condition. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial in his case to prevent further complications.  
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,22,Slide 1: Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Presentation  Slide 2: Patient Introduction: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith.  Slide 3: General Information: Mr. Smith resides in a suburban area of Chicago. He's retired from a managerial job confirming a sedentary lifestyle and he is a non-smoker.  Slide 4: Demographics: The chosen demographic is supported by literature stating that DVT most commonly occurs in adults over the age of 60 years  with a slightly higher predominance in males  and more frequent among Caucasians.  Slide 5: Pathophysiology: DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins  usually in the leg. This condition can be life-threatening when clots break off and travel to the lungs  causing a pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Symptom Presentation: Mr. Smith presented with a swollen left leg  complaining about a cramping pain. He also mentioned a warm feeling on the area along with skin discoloration.   Slide 7: Risk Factors: Mr. Smith's sedentary lifestyle and recent history of a 7-hour long-haul flight before the symptoms appeared contributed to the risk of DVT.  Slide 8:  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and was under medication for the same. There is no history of any major surgeries or injuries. He is not on any blood thinning medications or hormone therapies and no past occurrences of DVT. Detailed medical history did not identify any genetic predisposition to clotting disorders.  Slide 9: Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  noticeable swelling in the left leg was observed. Doppler Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep vein of his affected leg.  Slide 10: Treatment Plan: Mr. Smith was admitted for inpatient management of his condition. Treatment started with anticoagulants to prevent the clot from getting bigger  and to stop the formation of new clots.   Slide 11: Prevention: Lifestyle modifications recommended including encouraging a more active lifestyle to prevent future episodes and instructions given not to sit for long periods.  Slide 12: Conclusions: DVT is largely preventable and manageable  but timely diagnosis is important for optimal outcomes. This case of Mr. Smith highlights the need for awareness of risk factors and early symptom recognition.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,23,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we will be presenting a case of a patient diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 60-year-old white female  living in an urban area with a job in administration. According to research  DVT is more common in older people  with the highest rate among individuals aged 60 years and above  signaling a plausible incidence in our patient.  Slide 3: Medical History  She has a past medical history of obesity and hypertension  two conditions associated with an increased risk for DVT. These risk factors  combined with her sedentary lifestyle due to her job specifics and two recent long haul flights  greatly increased her chances of developing blood clots.  Slide 4: Symptoms and Diagnosis  She presented to the clinic with a one-week history of unilateral swelling and pain in her right leg. On examination  the leg was warm  swollen  and tender  particularly along the course of the deep veins. These classic signs and symptoms  together with a positive D-Dimer test and confirmation through Duplex Ultrasonography  led to her DVT diagnosis.  Slide 5: Summary   Our patient is a typical example of Deep Vein Thrombosis  taking her age  occupation  personal habits  and medical history into consideration. Prevention strategies and awareness  especially for high-risk groups  are crucial in reducing incidences of DVT and associated complications. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,24,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged African-American Female  Introduction: Today we will be discussing the case of a 55-year-old African-American female presented in the emergency department with a 2-day history of bilateral leg swelling and calf pain  predominantly on the left side.  Demographics: The patient  Mrs. Aaliyah Thomas  is a native resident of Queens  New York. She is married  is a non-smoker  and works in a department store where she spends long periods standing. She lives with her husband and has no children.   Medical History: Mrs. Thomas has a body mass index (BMI) of 33  which classifies her as obese. She has a known medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure  both currently being managed with medication. Unfortunately  she has a poor history of compliance with regular physician visits or maintaining her prescriptions due to financial constraints. There is no family history of thromboembolic events  but her mother had a stroke at the age of 68.  Presenting Issue: She reported a progressively worsening left calf pain and noted visible swelling in both legs  more pronounced on the left. She did not report any recent trauma  injuries  or long periods of immobilization that might have triggered the symptoms. There was no prior history of similar episodes. She has also noticed a mild shortness of breath but no cough  chest pain  or hemoptysis.   Preliminary Examination: Upon arrival  her blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  pulse rate 91 beats/min  respiratory rate 20 breaths/min  and temperature 37.3 °C. Her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Physical examination demonstrated notable swelling of the left lower extremity with palpable cords  warmth  redness  intense pain on movement  and significant tenderness on calf muscle compression.  Given Mrs. Thomas's clinical presentation and her risk factors  including age  obesity  and her long hours of standing at work  a suspected diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. Further investigations  including laboratory and imaging studies  were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and manage her condition effectively.  This case presents a common clinical demographic for DVT: middle-aged  African-American women with a number of risk factors  such as obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and prolonged periods of immobilization due to her work conditions.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,26,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  1. Introduction (Demographics and initial presentation)     Patient's Name: Mr. James Wilson     Age: 68 years     Gender: Male    Race: Caucasian    Occupation: Retired Engineer     Initial Claim: Mr. Wilson presented to the family practice clinic with complaints of unexplained  persistent pain  and swelling in his right lower leg. He also reported a warmth sensation  red or discolored skin  and visible surface veins.   2. Past Medical History     Mr. Wilson's past medical history is notable for several risk factors commonly associated with DVT: an episode of hospitalization for congestive heart failure two years ago  a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity  and a 40-year history of smoking  for which he quit five years ago. He's also  notably  overweight with a BMI of 30 kg/m^2. Additionally  he has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both are well-controlled with medications.  3. Family History     There's significant family history  as Mr. Wilson's father suffered from deep vein thrombosis and later died from pulmonary embolism. His older sister was diagnosed with factor V Leiden  a genetic clotting disorder. No other relevant family medical history is noted.  4. Social History     Mr. Wilson has been living with his wife since he got retired. His alcohol intake is moderate and reported no illicit drug use. He previously smoked one pack/day for 40 years but had quit smoking since last five years.  5. Assessment and Plan     Given Mr. Wilson's clinical presentation and his background risk factors including older age  obesity  former smoker  chronic conditions and relevant family history  a high suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is warranted. Further diagnostic evaluations including a D-dimer test and a Doppler ultrasound scan have been proposed. Additionally  consultations with a cardiologist and possibly a hematologist are planned.   We aim to reinforce lifestyle modification advice  particularly concerning diet and exercise  and to review Mr. Wilson's smoking cessation status. If a confirmed diagnosis of DVT is made  he will likely require an anticoagulant regimen and close outpatient follow-up. Patient education efforts will focus on awareness on importance of medication adherence  preventive measures and signs of potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.  In summary  Mr. Wilson is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a high index of suspicion for DVT  primarily due to his risk factors and presenting symptoms. A systematic approach to confirm his diagnosis and manage his potential DVT will be taken to ensure optimum patient outcomes.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,27,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male named Mr. Thompson. He resides in the urban area of Detroit  Michigan  and is a retired automobile factory worker with a history of smoking.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Thompson presented to our medical department complaining of pain and swelling in his left lower extremity that had been worsening over the past week. The pain was described as a dull aching sensation  especially when standing or walking. He also reported a slight increase in shortness of breath over the same period.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson's past medical history includes Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both controlled through medication. He also has a history of obesity with BMI above 30 kg/m2. His family history includes father who died of stroke and a sister diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Observations & Diagnosis: Upon examination  noticeable edema was present in Mr. Thompson's left leg. A Doppler ultrasonography subsequently confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the deep veins of his left lower extremity. When combined with reported symptoms  the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made.  Risk Factors: According to the literature  patients who are older  particularly those over 60 years of age and those with a history of obesity  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle are at increased risk for developing DVT. Mr. Thompson’s age and medical history align with the typical demographic representation for this condition. His African-American ethnicity and male gender are also noted as risk factors in certain studies  with DVT prevalence reported higher amongst African-American population.  Note: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition requiring timely diagnosis and appropriate management to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. It predominantly affects individuals in their middle and older years  with greater incidences amongst men and certain ethnic groups.  References: Kim  S.  & Kuroda  T.  2018.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,28,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  who is currently residing in New York City. He lives with his wife in a private home. His primary language is English and he's a non-smoker with a moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a complaint of increasing swelling and pain in the left calf over a period of three days  without any history of injury. He also reports recent shortness of breath and intermittent chest discomfort.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of obesity  notably inactive lifestyle  prolonged mobility due to recurrent gout  and has taken several long-distance flights recently. Additionally  he has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both managed with medications. The patient underwent right hip replacement surgery approximately 15 months ago. His family history reveals that his mother had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after a prolonged bed rest following a stroke.  Examination: Physical inspection showed a visibly swollen and tender left calf  slightly warmer than the right calf. There was no observed wound  discoloration or signs of infection. No recorded fever and vital signs were within a normal range.  Impression: Considering the patient's symptoms  medical history  and clinical examination  there is a high degree of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The recent history of immobility  coupled with the persistent calf pain and swelling  could indicate the formation of a clot in the deep veins of the left leg. In addition to DVT  there is also a significant risk of pulmonary embolism (PE)  due to associated shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  Plan: Further investigations including Doppler ultrasonography of both lower limbs  D-dimer test  and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram  are necessary to confirm DVT and exclude PE. Pending results  immediate anticoagulation therapy would be initiated.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,29,Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  I am presenting Mrs. Grace Thompson  a 60-year-old Caucasian female residing in the Midwest region of the United States. She has a BMI indicative of obesity with a value of 32  placing her in a high-risk category for various health conditions.   Mrs. Thompson has a known past medical history of factor V Leiden mutation and has been on long-term hormonal replacement therapy. Both of these factors notably increase her predisposition towards thrombotic events. Furthermore  she was a chronic smoker until her diagnosis five years ago with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)  of which she has had multiple exacerbations requiring hospitalizations. Mrs. Thompson was also recently hospitalized for a total hip arthroplasty  which further increases her risk of blood clot formation due to immobilization during recovery.  She presents with pain  swelling  and redness in her left calf that has gradually worsened over the past week. The patient notes the pain intensifies with standing or walking and alleviates somewhat when she elevates her leg. There is no noted fever  however  she expressed concern over the warmth of her lower limb.  Upon physical examination  her left calf appears swollen with a clear circumference difference compared to the right calf. Homans' sign was positive  eliciting pain when her foot was dorsiflexed. No ulcers or signs of any skin infection were noted.  Given her presenting symptoms  coupled with her high-risk factors such as obesity  recent orthopaedic surgery  hereditary clotting disorder  and long-term use of hormonal therapy  it is highly suggestive that Mrs. Thompson may be suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  The next step will be to confirm the diagnosis with a Duplex ultrasound  the first-line imaging procedure  and treat it early to prevent life-threatening complications such as a pulmonary embolism. The long-term management will involve anticoagulant therapy  lifestyle modifications including weight management  and smoking cessation if not already achieved. Also  post-discharge orthopedic follow-up is warranted concerning her recent hip surgery.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,30,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Name: Ms. Lopez Age: 65-years-old Sex: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Recently retired school teacher  Presenting complaint: Ms. Lopez reports experiencing recent onset pain and swelling in the left leg  which worsened over the past week. She also notes a feeling of warmth in the affected area  accompanied by skin redness.  Past Medical History: Ms. Lopez was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago which she has been managing using a prescribed beta-blocker  Metoprolol. Additionally  she has been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and has been maintaining her blood sugar levels through Metformin and dietary changes.   Past Surgical History: Ms. Lopez underwent an uncomplicated total hip replacement 5 years ago. She reports no other surgeries.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father had a myocardial infarction at age 68  while her mother and elder sister both had cerebrovascular accidents in their late 60s.   Social history: Ms. Lopez is a non-smoker and a social drinker. She lives alone but she maintains regular interaction with her children and grandchildren. She enjoys gardening and reading. She reports that she has gained weight since retirement and has been less active.  Current Medications:  Metoprolol for Hypertension  Metformin for Diabetes Type II  Review of literature indicates the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) tends to increase with age. Females  particularly those with a history of surgeries such as hip replacement and other risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  history of cardiovascular diseases  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle  are more susceptible to DVT.  Diagnosis:  Based on her age  female gender  history of hip replacement surgery  presence of other comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes)  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and the clinical symptomatology  a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected in Ms. Lopez.  Next  lab tests would be recommended to confirm the diagnosis  including a d-Dimer test and an Ultrasound of the lower extremities. May consider further imaging like venography or MRI if necessary. She may also need to consult with a Hematologist for management options like anticoagulants if diagnosed with DVT.   References: 1) Heit JA  et al. (2002).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,31,Title: Case Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Profile: Gender: Female   Age: 62  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Marital Status: Widowed  Location: Santa Fe  New Mexico  Presenting condition:  Mrs. M is a 62-year-old Caucasian female patient who recently visited the emergency department complaining of persistent swelling and tenderness in her left lower leg accompanied with mild fever and slight shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mrs. M has a consistent history remarkable for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and high cholesterol which are well-managed with medications including a beta-blocker  metformin  and a statin. She has no known drug allergies. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery on her left knee 2 months ago.   Social history:  Mrs. M is a widow who lives independently. She is a retired school teacher with a history of moderate alcohol use  and she quit smoking 10 years ago. She has a relatively sedentary lifestyle  enjoys reading and gardening. Her diet is balanced  but she admits to indulging her sweet tooth on occasion.   Family Medical History:  Her father had a stroke in his 70s  and her mother had breast cancer. One of her brothers was diagnosed with DVT earlier this year  and her sister has type 2 diabetes.  Given her recent knee surgery  moderately sedentary lifestyle  and genetic predisposition (brother with DVT)  Mrs. M descends into a high-risk category for deep vein thrombosis.   Diagnostic results: A complete blood count  chemistry panel  coagulation studies  and D-dimer assay were ordered. The D-dimer level was elevated  prompting us to perform a compression ultrasound  which confirmed the presence of DVT in her left leg.  Next steps: Comprehensive treatment is initiated  including anticoagulation medication to prevent clot extension and potential embolization to the pulmonary system. Lifestyle modification discussions around diet  exercise  and leg elevation are conducted. Regular follow-up appointments and periodic ultrasound scans have been advised to assess clot resolution and therapy success.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,32,Patient Presentation  Mr. Garcia  a 67-year-old Hispanic male  presents with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is retired from a job in transportation and resides in Texas with his wife.  Chief Complaint  Mr. Garcia reports increasing pain in his left calf for the past couple of days  which has not been relieved by over-the-counter pain medication. He describes the pain as persistent  throbbing  and somewhat accompanied by warmth and redness in the area.  Past Medical History  Mr. Garcia has a history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. He was diagnosed with both conditions 9 years ago and manages them with oral medication and diet. Mr. Garcia further reveals that he was a previous smoker but quit about 10 years ago. Additionally  he has a family history of cardiovascular diseases – his father had a stroke  and his older brother was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism  a complication related to DVT.  Social History  Mr. Garcia leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle since retiring from his job 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and reports no illicit drug use. He also has a diet rich in processed foods high in sodium  but he is trying to transition to healthier options due to his hypertension.  Clinical Assessment  A physical examination reveals swelling in the left calf  which is tender to the touch  warm  and slightly red compared to the right calf. There is noticeable edema and a slight temperature difference between the left and right calf.  In this case  considering Mr. Garcia’s age  sedentary lifestyle  previous smoking habit  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of blood clot-related diseases  he is at a high risk for developing DVT. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent possible life-threatening complications  such as a pulmonary embolism.   Next steps will include further diagnostic studies such as a D-dimer test or venous ultrasound  and  if confirmed  appropriate treatment will be initiated to prevent further complications. This strategy will likely involve the use of anticoagulant medications and lifestyle modifications to help him manage his health conditions and prevent the progression of the disease.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,33,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographics: Our patient  Mr. Jackson  is a 68-year-old Caucasian male from an urban area of New York City. He is a retired engineer  married  and has three grown children. Prior to his retirement  his role was sedentary  spending most of his time in front of a computer. His current lifestyle remains predominantly sedentary. He is a non-smoker  but he confesses to daily alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jackson has a significant medical history notable for obesity with a Body Mass Index of 32. He has been suffering from type II diabetes for the past 15 years  under control with medication  and high blood pressure treated with lifestyle changes and medication. His father had a history of heart disease and his mother passed away from a stroke  which puts him at high risk of cardiovascular conditions. There are no notable operations in his past. His prescribed medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for high blood pressure  and Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and he occasionally takes Over-the-Counter ibuprofen for joint discomfort.  Presenting Situation: Mr. Jackson arrived at our clinic today complaining of a swollen  aching left leg. The pain has been developing gradually over the past week  becoming sharp and he also reports feeling a sensation of heat in the swollen area. He reports no chest pain  shortness of breath  or any other symptoms suggesting pulmonary embolism. Given his sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and history of other cardiovascular-related morbidities  he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a venous color Doppler ultrasound test.   Conclusion: This is a common presentation of deep vein thrombosis  particularly in older  sedentary individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions. Early identification and appropriate management are crucial in order to prevent potential fatal complications such as a pulmonary embolism. Mr. Jackson has been admitted for further evaluation and initiation of appropriate medical intervention. His case also emphasizes the significance of physical activity and lifestyle changes in preventing venous thromboembolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,34,Title: Case Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis  I. Patient Demographics The patient  Mr. A  is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presenting from Nebraska  USA. He is married  has two grown children and works a sedentary desk job with limited physical activity. He is a non-smoker but occasionally consumes alcohol. His height is 6 feet and he is overweight with a BMI of 30.   II. Presenting Symptoms Mr. A presents with unilateral leg swelling  erythema and a feeling of warmth in his left leg which came on gradually over a few days. Additionally  he also reported experiencing some localized discomfort and pain particularly when the leg is touched or moved. No associated symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain were mentioned.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. A's past medical history suggests a hypercoagulable state with a DVT event in his mid-40s. Other aspects of his medical history show controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He follows a regular medication regimen which includes an antihypertensive drug and oral hypoglycemic agents. He had his previous DVT managed with anticoagulation therapy without complications. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disorders.   IV. Relevant Health Behavior History  Mr. A admits to a lifestyle with little physical activity. His diet is generally high in fatty foods which has contributed to his overweight status. Three weeks ago  he went on an international flight  which involved a prolonged period of immobility. Though he was advised similar precautions as taken during his previous DVT event like compression stockings and mobility exercises  he neglected these on this occasion.  V. Conclusion Given his symptoms  past medical and family history  lifestyle factors and recent long-haul flight  our patient Mr. A is suspected to be suffering from a recurrent episode of deep vein thrombosis. Further investigations including duplex ultrasonography should be organized promptly to confirm the diagnosis and review his current anticoagulant therapy for any adjustments. Lifestyle modifications will also need to be addressed.

His nationality is American and his primary language is English. He is a retired accountant  a non-smoker  and occasionally consumes alcohol. Mr. Thompson is married with two children and tends to live a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed with medication for the past five years. He had a right hip replacement surgery two years ago. His family history reveals that his father had a stroke at age 70  and an older brother underwent treatment for DVT in his mid-50s.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Thompson came to the clinic complaining of unilateral swelling and pain in his right calf that has been getting worse over the past week. He noted the pain becomes severe when he stands or walks. Additionally  he mentioned experiencing a minor case of shortness of breath. Upon physical examination  the right calf was found to be erythematous and edematous compared to the left calf  with a slight increase in warmth.  Given his personal medical history  family history  age  and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was suspect. Diagnostic testing including a D-dimer test and Doppler ultrasound was subsequently ordered to confirm the diagnosis.   The development of DVT in Mr. Thompson mirrors epidemiological data which suggests an increased risk of DVT due to genetic predisposition  a history of surgery  older age  diabetes  hypertension  and a sedentary lifestyle. The next step in his care plan would be the initiation of anticoagulant therapy and close follow-up to monitor for complications or progression  including the risk of pulmonary embolism as evidenced by his reported shortness of breath.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,36,Title: Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female from an urban setting who presents with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). She is retired  living with her husband  and has two grown children. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease and has been previously diagnosed with obesity and hypertension. She is a former smoker  having stopped 15 years ago but has a 30 pack-year history. The patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) is classified as obese at 32.9. She denies alcohol or recreational drug use.  Past Medical History: The patient has been under treatment for hypertension for the past seven years and routinely takes an antihypertensive drug  Lisinopril. For her obesity  she has been encouraged to make lifestyle changes  including diet modifications and exercise  but adherence has been inconsistent due to her suffering from mild osteoarthritis. She had a transitory ischemic attack (TIA) three years ago but recovered with no permanent neurological deficits.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressively worsening unilateral leg swelling  warmth  and discomfort in the left lower extremity. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or recent trauma to the area. On examination  there's noticeable edema on the left leg  around the calf area  which is tender on palpation. The leg is warm and erythematous compared to the right. Her pulses in the affected leg are palpable but slightly diminished  more likely due to the swelling.  Clinical Considerations: Considering the patient’s age  obesity  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease  along with her symptoms  she falls into a high-risk category for DVT. An assessment with a duplex ultrasound or venography should be undertaken quickly for definitive diagnosis. Given the presence of ongoing risk factors and a family history of cardiovascular disease  the patient should be educated about the risk of potential complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism.  Please note  while this clinical scenario represents a typical demographic and symptomology seen in DVT  it should not be used to stereotype patients  as DVT can present in any patient population regardless of demographic factors. A high degree of suspicion and careful examination is required in all cases. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,37,Patient Presentation  The patient  Mr. Samuel Broussard  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male. He presents with complaints consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He reports a one week history of gradually worsening pain in his left calf  accompanied by swelling and a warm sensation. The pain becomes more severe when he attempts to walk or stand.  Mr. Brouard is a retired truck driver and confesses to having followed a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement. On questioning  he reports sitting for prolonged periods  4-5 hours at a stretch daily while reading or watching TV. He admits to being a former smoker  but has quit about five years ago.  He has a prior medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he’s currently on medication. Mr Brouard underwent hip replacement surgery two months ago. His family history includes a brother who had a stroke in his early sixties.   His BMI is 29  suggesting overweight  signifying a potential risk factor for DVT. He also reports occasional alcohol consumption.   On examination  his left lower leg appeared swollen and erythematous  with a noticeable increase in circumference in comparison to the right leg. The calf was tender upon palpation. A definitive diagnosis would require further tests  such as a D-dimer test and duplex ultrasonography  to confirm DVT.  In conclusion  given patient’s recent orthopedic surgery  sedentary lifestyle and his past medical conditions like hypertension  diabetes along with a hypertensive brother  Mr. Brouard falls into the high-risk category for developing DVT. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management can help prevent complications  such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,38,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting a 67-year-old Caucasian male patient who has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He hails from Billings  Montana  and is a retired construction worker. The patient comes from a lower-middle socioeconomic stratum and is a 40 pack-year smoker. He does not have a history of illicit drug use and consumes alcohol occasionally. The patient has a BMI of 28. He is a widower with 2 children  both living independently  and lacks family support. He lives alone in his apartment  which is located in an urban area.  Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes which he has managed with prescribed medications for 12 years now. Despite his medical conditions  the patient has remained largely physically active. However  a recent surgical procedure on his left knee five weeks ago limited his mobility  leading to prolonged sedentary periods.  In the last two weeks  the patient presents with worsening left calf pain  swelling  skin warmth  and discoloration. His vitals today were as follows: BP  143/98 mmHg; HR  78 bpm; temp  98.7 F; RR  16/min; Saturation  98% on room air. A Duplex ultrasound was done which confirmed the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in his left lower leg.   Given his recent immobility and a positive diagnosis of DVT  the patient is at high risk for pulmonary embolism. We need to discuss potential treatment options  including anticoagulation therapy  and modify his risk factors to alleviate his condition and prevent complications.  It is further recommended a thorough evaluation of his lifestyle choices  nutritional intake  exercise routine  and reassessment of his long-term care needs  particularly in the light of his solitary living conditions. Family engagement may perhaps be encouraged for emotional  moral  and physical support.   In conclusion  medical history  the post-surgical period  obesity  advanced age combined with lifestyle factors  such as smoking and prolonged immobilization  contributes to the risk profile of deep vein thrombosis in our patient. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,39,Title: A Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious medical condition characterized by blood clots in the deep veins  typically those of the lower extremities. We present the case of a 60-year-old African American male with a recent diagnosis of DVT.  Patient Information: Our patient is a 60-year-old African American male  employed as a long-distance truck driver  residing in Atlanta  Georgia. He has an active smoking habit of about 15 cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He drinks alcohol socially and does not engage in recreational drugs.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient came in with complaints of swelling  pain and redness in the right calf for a week  which has been progressively worsening. He also reported experiencing mild chest discomfort over the past two days. There is no history of recent trauma or injury to the affected leg.   Past Medical History:  Significantly  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago and Hypertension five years ago  for which he is on medications (Metformin & Amlodipine). However  there is no known history of cardiac disease  previous episodes of DVT or Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  nor any family history of clotting disorders. He has an allergy to penicillin which results in skin rashes.  Physical Examination: On examination  his right calf appeared swollen and red with a palpable cord-like structure suggesting thrombosis. He also had mild pedal edema. His vitals were stable.  Investigations: An Ultrasonography Doppler of the right lower extremity was advised which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the right popliteal vein. Due to the presentation of chest discomfort  further evaluation with a D-Dimer test and possible CT angiographic assessment could be considered.  Conclusively  this is a case of DVT presenting in a high-risk individual due to his demographic profile  sedentary nature of occupation  smoking habit  and pre-existing medical conditions. Prompt evaluation  management and close follow-up are necessary given the risk of potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.   Discussion: Deep vein thrombosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is more common in African Americans  and the risk increases with age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking and underlying co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension. This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition  treatment  and risk factor management in DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,40,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction Our patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male who presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a serious condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in the deeper veins of the body  often in the lower limbs.  Slide 2: Demographics The prevalence of DVT is higher among older adults and occurs more frequently in males than in females. This patient's age and gender align with the typical demographic profile of individuals with DVT. According to literature  Caucasians have the highest incidence rates of DVT.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Mr. X reports a gradual onset of unilateral leg pain and swelling over the past week  particularly in his left calf. He notes the discomfort intensifies when standing or walking. He has also noticed increased warmth over the affected area and a slight change in his leg's color. These symptoms are consistent with those of DVT.  Slide 4: Past Medical History On taking a detailed medical history  it came to light that the patient had undergone a hip replacement surgery two months ago  which puts him at an increased risk for the complication of DVT. Additionally  he has a history of heavy smoking and occasional alcohol drinking. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia approximately 5 years ago  both controlled with medication.  Slide 5: Family History: Patient noted a family history of coagulation disorders  with his father experiencing a similar issue at a comparable age. Genetic factors play an important role in the susceptibility to DVT.  Slide 6: Social and Occupational History Mr. X recently retired from his job as a long-haul truck driver  a profession associated with long periods of immobility  further increasing his DVT risk.  Thus  this case illustrates the common demographic profile and risk factors associated with DVT such as age  male sex  post-surgical status  sedentary profession  and a significant relevant family history. A comprehensive evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,41,Title: A Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information - Name: Mrs. Sandra McCarthy - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Female - Occupation: Retired School Teacher - Race: Caucasian  - Nationality: American - Marital status: Widowed - Smoking History: Non-smoker - Alcohol history: Occasional drinker  Chief Complaint Mrs. McCarthy presents with progressive swelling and pain in the left lower leg that started after a long haul flight about four days ago. She describes the pain as consistent and aching.  Past Medical History Mrs. McCarthy has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which she takes Metformin  statins for Hyperlipidemia  and she is on regular Aspirin for Primary Prevention of cardiovascular disease. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery in the right knee two years ago. She also has a history of recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). There's no previous history of any thromboembolic incidents. She takes no oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.  Family History Her mother and father died at 90 and 75 respectively. Mother had a geriatric age with osteoarthritis and father passed away from myocardial infarction. She has no siblings. Her only son aged 38 is alive and well.  Socioeconomic Status She's a widow living alone in a suburban neighborhood  her son visits her twice a week. Her financial condition remains stable through her teaching pension and her late husband's savings.  Description Though deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can occur in any demographic  studies demonstrate increased incidence in individuals over 60 years old  making Mrs. McCarthy's case not uncommon. Her recent long-haul flight  a period of immobilization  coupled with her age  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia all increase her risk for venous thrombosis.   While her gender does not necessarily constitute a risk  it does factor into her demographics as DVT can affect both sexes  although studies indicate a slight predilection for males. Representation among races varies  with Caucasians like Mrs. McCarthy at a moderate risk compared to other groups  though her nationality does not automatically place her at elevated risk.  Considering her past medical history  the clinician should keep DVT as a differential diagnosis  and an early Doppler ultrasound might be warranted. Her case highlights the importance of vigilance for DVT in similar individuals while considering individual demographic  lifestyle  and medical factors.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,42,Patient Presentation  Patient: Mr. John Doe  Age: 64 years   Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  This patient's case is representative of the most common demographic affected by deep vein thrombosis  as it predominantly affects adults over the age of 60 and is slightly more common in men than in women.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history. He has been a smoker for more than 40 years with a consumption of 20 cigarettes per day  making him a high risk for vascular disease. He has well-controlled hypertension for which he has been on medication for the past ten years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been managing it with oral hypoglycemic agents for the last seven years. Furthermore  he has a history of myocardial infarction around three years ago and since then he has been stable after the placement of two stents. He also underwent hip replacement surgery about two weeks ago due to severe osteoarthritis.  Surgical History:  Mr. Doe had angioplasty and hip replacement surgery.  Family History:  His mother suffered from venous thromboembolism at an older age and his father passed away due to a stroke.  Social History:  He lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver now. He is a retired school teacher and lives a sedentary lifestyle  spending most of his time reading. He has two adult children who live out of town.  Presentation:  Yesterday  he started experiencing pain and swelling in the left leg. He initially thought it might be due to the recent surgery but as the pain continued to worsen  it became difficult for him to move around  prompting his visit to the clinic today. On examination  his left leg appears swollen and warm to touch with the overlying skin appearing slightly reddish.  Given his recent surgery  advanced age  male sex  personal smoking history  presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  and history of myocardial infarction and a family history of venous thromboembolism  Mr. Doe is at significant risk for deep vein thrombosis. His symptoms seem suggestive and require further investigation to confirm the diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,43,Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition where blood clots form within deep veins  most commonly in the lower leg  thigh or pelvis. If the clot dislodges  it can lead to a pulmonary embolism  which may potentially be life-threatening.  Patient's Demographics and Presentation Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 66-year-old white male from a suburban setting. He is a retired accountant with a history of sedentary lifestyle  mainly characterized by prolonged periods of sitting. He does not smoke  is a mild alcohol consumer  but is overweight with a BMI of 28 kg/m².  Medical History Mr. Doe has a medical history of well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He recently had an arthroscopic knee surgery three weeks ago  after which his mobility had been significantly reduced. There's no known history of any familial clotting disorder.   Current Presentation Mr. Doe presented at the clinic with signs and symptoms suggestive of DVT. He complained of increasing pain and swelling in his left lower leg  particularly below the knee  that started a few days ago. The pain was described as a cramp  and worsened when he bent his foot upward or walked around. He also noticed mild redness and warmth over the affected area. Mr. Doe did not report any chest pain or breathlessness. He was visibly distressed about the sudden and acute discomfort in his leg.  Risk Factors The patient's age  his post-surgery immobility  sedentary lifestyle and comorbid conditions such as obesity and diabetes put him at an increased risk of developing DVT. The presence of more than one risk factor multiplies the risk considerably.  Conclusion Given Mr. Doe's clinical presentation and existing risk factors  there is a strong suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Prompt diagnosis via duplex ultrasound and immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is crucial to prevent possible complications like pulmonary embolism. The intervention will also include lifestyle modification advice  particularly focused on increasing mobility  and adherence to a healthier diet to optimize his weight and overall health status. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,44,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Presentation   Subject: Mr. John Smith  Demographic Information: John Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male living in an urban area. He is retired and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and openly admits a lifestyle that was sedentary prior to his retirement. Mr. Smith has a BMI of 29 which is deemed as overweight  consistent with the demographic most at risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has an established medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes - both under control with medication. He underwent a hip replacement surgery two years ago. He has no known allergies. There's no previous history of blood clotting disorders in the family.   Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith presented to the hospital complaining of a sudden onset of pain  warmth  redness  and swelling in one of his legs  more profound in the calf region. The patient reported these symptoms started three days ago and have gradually worsened. He denies any recent long-haul travels but has been even less active than usual over the past week due to a flu-like illness.   Clinical Impression: Based on his medical history  presenting symptoms  and risk factors such as age  sedentary lifestyle  recent inactivity  past surgery  and chronic health conditions like obesity  hypertension  and diabetes  Mr. Smith's symptomatology is highly suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further investigation with doppler ultrasonography will confirm the diagnosis. Appropriate management will be initiated accordingly.   References: 1. Heit JA et al. (2017).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,45,Patient Presentation:  Today  we have a 67-year-old Caucasian female patient Mrs. A presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is a retired high school teacher and resides in Fairfield  Connecticut with her husband.   She has a history of intermittent claudication and reports over the past week  she has been experiencing increased pain and swelling in her right lower extremity  particularly following periods of inactivity. Additionally  she has noticed a degree of warmth and redness over the area of discomfort.   Her past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes  managed with metformin  and hypertension  controlled with lisinopril. Mrs. A had a hip replacement surgery one year ago. She is also postmenopausal and has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the past 7 years. She has a 40 pack-year smoking history but she quit smoking 15 years ago.  This patient's clinical presentation  along with her risk factors such as previous joint surgery  long-term HRT use  and a history of smoking  indicate a high suspicion for DVT. Therefore  venous Duplex ultrasound will be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,46,"Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Introduction: We are presenting the case of Mr. John Smith  a 55-year-old Caucasian male who is currently dealing with symptoms related to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Mr. Smith is a retired office clerk  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He is a lifetime non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith presented to the office with complaints of swelling  pain  and warmth in the left calf area that have been progressively worsening over the past few days. He described his pain as """"aching """" """"cramping """" and 6/10 in intensity  on a pain scale. He had no history of injury to his leg  indicating these symptoms were not due to trauma. He also noted increased fatigue over this period.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is known to have Type 2 diabetes  high cholesterol  and hypertension that are managed with oral medication (Metformin  Atorvastatin  and Lisinopril respectively). He had an appendectomy 25 years ago  and his immunizations are up-to-date. His family history includes heart diseases; his father had myocardial infarction at 62 and his mother has hypertension. His sister has recently been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis.  Risk Factors: Given Mr. Smith's sedentary lifestyle post-retirement and recent long-duration flights over the holidays  he demonstrates several risk factors associated with DVT. Additionally  age  family history of DVT  and his history of diabetes and hypertension also put him at higher risk.   Clinical Exam: Physical examination of the left lower leg revealed swelling  redness  warmth  and calf tenderness to palpation. His vital signs upon presentation were stable: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 90/min  respiration rate 16/min and temperature is 98.6 °F.   Final Notes: Given his presentation  past medical history  clinical findings  and risk factors  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is suspected. The patient is referred for further diagnostic studies  including a D-dimer assay and venous doppler ultrasound  to confirm the diagnosis and extent of the condition.   His case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of DVT and being aware of the risk factors  particularly amongst patients with a sedentary lifestyle  advanced age  and history of venous thromboembolism in family. The patient will also be counseled on the disease  treatment  and lifestyle modifications required."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,47,"Slide 1: Introduction Patient: Mrs. Jane Crawford  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presenting with symptoms suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 2: Demographic Information Mrs. Crawford is a retired schoolteacher living in suburban Oregon with her husband. She has two adult children residing out-of-state. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. Her BMI is 29.6  which falls within the “overweight” category.  Slide 3: Presenting Issues  Patient complains of persistent pain and noticeable swelling in her left lower limb  particularly her calf muscle.

Slide 7: Risk Factors  Mrs. Crawford has several risk factors for DVT: age above 60  obesity  personal history of cancer (colon)  recent hip fracture leading to prolonged immobility  and current medication that may contribute to blood clotting.  Slide 8: Conclusion  The patient’s symptoms  along with her risk factor profile  suggest a high index of suspicion for the development of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm this preliminary assessment. The patient needs immediate attention  considering the potential risks associated with untreated DVT  such as pulmonary embolism."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,48,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male who presents with complaints of pain  warmth  swelling  and redness in his left lower leg. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past week. He denies any recent trauma  surgeries  or travels.   Demographic Information:  He is a retired civil engineer  currently living with his wife in Chicago. He's an occasional smoker and admits to being moderately active. Mr. Smith has a strong family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father succumbing to a myocardial infarction at 68 and his mother suffering from stroke at 72.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are currently managed on medications. He has been diagnosed with obesity  with a calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35. He reports good medication adherence and regular follow-ups with his primary care physician.   He has no known drug allergies. His medications include Metformin 500mg twice a day for diabetes  Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension  and low-dose Aspirin as prescribed by his doctor.   Given his personal medical history of hypertension  diabetes  obesity  smoking habit  and strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  he has multiple risk factors that predispose him to deep vein thrombosis.   Summary:  Mr. Smith's case presents a common profile of patients at risk of deep vein thrombosis  which often afflicts people with multiple risk factors with the highest age-specific prevalence among African American adults over 60. Understanding these risks helps healthcare providers to implement appropriate diagnostic approaches and develop effective management plans.   References: Heit  J. A.  Spencer  F. A.  & White  R. H.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,49,Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Residence: Rural area  Midwestern United States  Demographics: As per available literature  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) risk increases with age and is more common in males. It is most prevalent among Caucasian adults.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of pain and swelling in his left leg. He reports the pain has progressively worsened. He denies any recent injuries to the area.   Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which he is on medication. He also had prostate cancer which was treated successfully with surgery 2 years ago. He is a retired truck driver and reports a sedentary lifestyle. He denies any family history of clotting disorders but admits to a 30-pack-year smoking history.  Medications: He currently takes Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension.  Allergies: He reports no known drug allergies.  DVT Risk Factors: The patient’s age  sex  and currently sedentary lifestyle are all risk factors for DVT. His history of cancer treatment is also a major risk factor  as 20% of cancer patients may develop DVT. Smoking and hypertension also contribute to increased risk.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his left lower extremity appears visibly swollen and is much warmer than the right. His calf is tender on deep palpation. His vital signs are normal.   Conclusion: In conclusion  with an accumulation of DVT risk factors and signs suggestive of DVT  this patient will require a duplex ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and subsequently will likely benefit from anticoagulation treatment. He has also been advised upon lifestyle modification  metabolism  and exercise.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,50,Title: A Case Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Riley. He lives in a suburban neighborhood of Dallas  Texas where he led a sedentary lifestyle due to his job as a software engineer. He is a former smoker who quit 5 years ago. He has a past history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Riley has come in today complaining of pain and swelling in the left leg which has been ongoing for approximately a week. He also reports feeling a warm sensation in the affected area. Mr. Riley hasn't experienced any chest pains  shortness of breath  or symptoms of other systemic diseases.   Past Medical History: Mr. Riley was diagnosed with hypertension about ten years ago  for which he has been on an ACE inhibitor. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia five years ago and prescribed statins  to which he has been compliant. He also has a history of intermittent claudication but has never had any surgeries. He quit smoking 5 years ago due to the onset of these health issues. He drinks alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use.   Given his sedentary work as a software engineer  his history of smoking  and presence of hyperlipidaemia  Mr. Riley has a relatively higher risk for deep vein thrombosis. Additionally  an aberration in his circulating lipoproteins due to hyperlipidemia may contribute to a hypercoagulable state.   Next steps: A Color Doppler ultrasound will be scheduled to help confirm the suspected diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. If DVT is confirmed  Mr. Riley will be started on anticoagulants immediately and counseled about the importance of regular exercise to improve his condition.   This presentation highlights that incidences of DVT are usually higher in elderly patients  those living a sedentary lifestyle  individuals with a history of smoking  or with other underlying health conditions such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Consequently  we should strive for early diagnosis and management to prevent complications. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,51,Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient's Demographics:  The patient being presented today is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  considered to be the most at-risk demographic group for deep vein thrombosis. The patient is an ex-smoker  with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Before retirement  the patient worked a desk job  which required copious amounts of prolonged sitting. He lives with his wife in a suburban setting.  Past Medical History:  The patient has consistently maintained a reasonable level of physical activity. However  his diet  high in saturated fats and cholesterol  and a history of smoking for several decades  has led to hypertension and high cholesterol. These conditions have been managed with medication (Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia) for the past eight years. He quit smoking six years ago  which constitutes a significant improvement in cardiovascular health risk status.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with unilateral (right leg) swelling  along with pain and a heavy ache in the same area. He also reported a warm sensation with mild skin discoloration. He has no noted chest pain or shortness of breath.   Risk Factors:  The patient’s prolonged periods of immobility due to both his former work environment and recent long-distance travel (flying)  put him at an increased risk for DVT. His age  along with his history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and former smoking habit  further increase his susceptibility.  Clinical Assessment:  Clinical findings are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However  further investigations  including a D-dimer blood test and Doppler Ultrasound of the right lower limb  are being undertaken to confirm the diagnosis.   This case emphasizes the potency of risk factors such as age  prolonged immobility  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  in the development of deep vein thrombosis. While the patient has made certain changes to his lifestyle  such as quitting smoking and maintaining a steady level of physical activity  he is advised to seek ways to improve his diet to better manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,52,"Slide 1: Title """"Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis""""  Slide 2: Patient Demographics """"Patient: 60-year-old Caucasian Male""""  Slide 3: Relevant Personal Background The patient is a retired office worker. He is a former smoker and he has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity. He is also overweight but maintains a balanced diet. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. One of his brothers died of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 10 years which are effectively managed with a combination of diet  lifestyle modifications  and pharmacotherapy. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago which is controlled with oral hypoglycemia agents. He also suffered from a mild stroke four years ago.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms The patient complains of a new onset unilateral leg pain  especially in the calf region  with associated redness  localized warmth  and significant swelling on the affected leg. He has been experiencing a progressive worsening in the leg pain over the past week. Other subjective symptoms include a slight shortness of breath and fatigue.   Slide 6: Synopsis Given his medical history  symptoms  and lifestyle  our primary suspicion is Deep Vein Thrombosis. This preliminary assessment is based on his risk factors  which includes age  family history of thrombotic diseases  prolonged immobilization due to sedentary lifestyle  history of hypertension  diabetes  and previous stroke. Further diagnostic tests will be carried out to confirm or rule out DVT.  Slide 7: Next Steps To confirm the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis  we would proceed with physical examination  D-dimer blood test  venous ultrasound  and possibly a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan. According to the results  we will decide the appropriate treatment plan which usually begins with anticoagulant therapy  lifestyle modifications  and possibly an interventional procedure if necessary. An underlying cause or contributing factors for DVT will also be sought to guide further management.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case highlights the importance of considering Deep Vein Thrombosis in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain  especially in those with multiple risk factors for thrombosis.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,53,Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  I. Demographics  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 62 years old  Race: Caucasian  Sex: Male Occupation: Office Worker Country of Residence: United States of America   II. Chief Complaint  Mr. Doe presents today with persistent pain and swelling in his lower left leg  particularly his calf region along with reddening of the skin for the past several days.   III. Past Medical History  Mr. Doe was previously diagnosed with obesity (BMI 35) and type 2 Diabetes at age 56. His diabetes is managed through diet control and oral glucose-lowering drugs. He also suffers from hypertension that is regulated by prescribed medications. He was a smoker in his middle age  smoking approximately 1 pack per day for 15 years  however  he quit smoking 10 years ago. There's no known family history of thromboembolic diseases. There is documented evidence of limited physical activity due to his sedentary work. He has no history of surgery.   As per literature  these demographic factors and medical histories  such as obesity  diabetes  sedentary lifestyle  and previous smoking habits are risk factors associated with deep vein thrombosis. Men over 60  particularly of Caucasian ethnicity  have a higher susceptibility to this vascular disorder. Therefore  initial assessment and tests point towards the potential diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in this patient.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,54,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Introduction: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male from a semi-urban area. He is retired and has been leading a relatively sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the clinic with a two-day history of pain and swelling in his right lower leg  specifically the calf area.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension (on Lisinopril 10mg daily)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (on Metformin 500mg twice daily)  and hyperlipidemia (on Atorvastatin 40mg daily). He is a former smoker (quit 5 years ago) and moderately consumes alcohol. He was recently on a long-distance flight about a week ago. He was hospitalized about eight months ago for a hernia repair  after which he received prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.   Family History: The patient's father and older sibling had a history of cardiovascular disease  particularly  myocardial infarction. His mother died at a late age from unrelated causes.  Medications: Currently  the patient is appropriately taking his prescribed hypertensive  diabetic  and hyperlipidemia medications without any recent changes.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient had a palpable cord in the calf  erythema  and a measurable difference in calf circumference. His vitals were within the normal range  except for an elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg.  This patient's risk factors for developing DVT include his advanced age  hypertension  history of recent surgery and prolonged immobilization  sedentary lifestyle  Type 2 diabetes  and personal and family history of cardiovascular disease.  In conclusion  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition that predominantly affects the older population having one or more risk factors. Prompt recognition and effective management play a pivotal role in preventing serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,55,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jane Smith Age: 60 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Patient History:  Mrs. Jane Smith is a 60-year-old Caucasian woman  a retired school teacher  who presents with a 48-hour history of increasing pain and swelling in her left lower leg. She has a history of sedentary lifestyle and obesity  having a BMI of 32. Additionally  she has a confirmed past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and varicose veins. Furthermore  she underwent a total knee replacement surgery about one month ago. She is a lifetime non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. Family history of myocardial infarction exists.  Present Complaint:  Mrs. Smith complained of warmth  tenderness  and redness over the affected area  primarily the calf  along with the leg swelling. She denied chest pain or shortness of breath. She has experienced no fever or signs of infection.  Physical Examination:  Upon assessment  her left calf diameter was 3 cm larger than her right  with a positive Homan's sign. Skin of the left leg displayed a warmer temperature and tender to touch. Her blood pressure was 140/90  and Pulse rate was 85 bpm.   Radiologic and Laboratory findings:  Preliminary findings of an ultrasound reveal blood clot present in her left lower leg  strongly indicative of deep vein thrombosis. Blood tests are ordered  and she was advised to remain in the hospital for further observation.  Similarly  according to the literature  patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) commonly fall in the age group of 60-70 years with minimal gender predilection  though it's slightly more common in males. About two-thirds of the cases have an identifiable risk factor  like Mrs Smith's instance of knee surgery and varicose veins leading to DVT. Furthermore  conditions like hypertension  diabetes  and obesity stand as risk factors  supporting Mrs. Smith's profile.   In conclusion  Mrs. Smith's case represents a typical deep vein thrombosis patient  taking into account demographic representation found in literature. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,56,Title: Assessment of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Senior Patient  **I. Demographics**  Patient's Name: Mr. John Doe   Age: 68 years   Sex: Male   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired engineer   Location: Miami  Florida   Marital Status: Married  **II. Chief Complaint**  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency room with a primary complaint of a three-day history of pain and swelling in his left lower leg. The pain has gradually worsened  and it's now associated with a mild degree of redness.  **III. Past Medical History**  Mr. Doe has been hypertensive for the last 15 years  which is well regulated with medication (metoprolol). He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes Metformin. Recently diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia  he has been on atorvastatin as per his primary care physician's advice.   Additionally  he underwent surgery for prostate cancer five years ago. A smoker until his prostate cancer diagnosis  he quit afterward but had a history of 30 pack-years. Also  Mr. Doe leads a sedentary lifestyle considering his retirement status and ageing factor.  **IV. Risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis**  Based on Mr. Doe's demographic and clinical profile  the following risk factors can be identified for the potential development of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):  - Age over 65: Studies indicate a higher prevalence of DVT in older age groups. - History of malignancy: Prostate cancer  in this case  can be a risk factor for DVT. - Sedentary lifestyle: Reduced mobility or long periods of inactivity can increase the risk. - Hypertension & diabetes: Presence of these chronic conditions can contribute to his risk profile. - Hypercholesterolemia: There's a potential link between abnormal lipid metabolism and DVT. - Smoking: Although currently non-smoker  his past heavy smoking habit could also contribute.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,57,[Slide 1]  Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  [Slide 2]  Patient Demographics:   - Name: John Smith - Age: 67 years - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian   [Slide 3]  Medical History Overview:   Mr. John Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a 3-day history of right leg swelling and discomfort. He reports that he noticed his leg becoming progressively tender and swollen after a long haul flight from Australia. He also mentioned his recent diagnosis of prostate cancer for which he is currently receiving chemotherapy.   [Slide 4]  Past Medical History:  John has a history of: - Prostate Cancer – diagnosed 6 months ago  currently undergoing chemotherapy. - Hypertension – controlled well with medication. - Type 2 Diabetes mellitus – diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with oral hypoglycaemic agents. - Myocardial Infarction – one episode 6 years ago.    [Slide 5]  Social History:  John is a retired engineer  who enjoys hunting and fishing. He is a smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He does not consume alcohol. He lives with his wife of 45 years  has three grown children  and maintains an active lifestyle  enjoying trips to see his grandchildren.  [Slide 6]  Family Medical History:  - Father died following stroke  age 72. - Mother with history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes died at age 81 from complications related to diabetes. - His older brother suffered a pulmonary embolism at an age of 70.  [Slide 7]  Risk Factors:  Given Mr. Smith’s recent immobility (long-distance flight)  presence of an active malignancy  his age  and his familial history  he has multiple risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombosis.  [Slide 8]  Conclusion:  The combination of distinct clinical features  past medical history  and risk factors strongly suggest a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in our patient  Mr. Smith. Appropriate medical testing and management strategies should be commenced immediately to confirm the diagnosis and prevent potential complications.   (Note: Prostate cancer is a risk factor for VTE  however  there exists conflicting evidence regarding whether chemotherapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of VTE. In this presentation  we took a conservative approach and listed it as a potential risk factor.)
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,58,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION: Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  originally from Dallas  Texas  comes in today with complaints related to circulation. He weighs 95kg  is 180cm tall (BMI 29.3)  and works as an engineer  a sedentary job. He recently went on a long-haul flight for a vacation  a potential risk factor for DVT.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Previously  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in his late forties and has had hypertension since his early fifties. Both conditions have been managed with consistent medication  including metformin for T2DM and Lisinopril for hypertension. He does not smoke or consume alcohol regularly but has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  PRESENTING COMPLAINTS: Mr. Johnson reports persistent pain and swelling in his left leg for the past week. He also complains of the affected leg feeling warmer than the other and a change in the color of his skin near the painful area. He has not sustained any recent trauma or injuries to the affected leg. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or fainting episodes.  Based on personal  familial  and current health history  as well as his recent prolonged travel  Mr. Johnson is considered at moderate to high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  PREVALENCE: The reported mean age for DVT is 60 years  with a slightly higher prevalence in males. DVT is more common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. Common risk factors among DVT patients often include older age  obesity  prolonged immobility (such as long-haul flights)  history of vascular diseases  and having concomitant conditions like diabetes and hypertension.  This presentation is consistent with scientific literature  demonstrating a patient who fits into a typical demographic for DVT. Each patient case will vary  and it's essential to consider their unique health profile and lifestyle factors when assessing DVT risk.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,59,Patient Presentation:  Meet Mr. Arnold  a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with an acute onset of intense pain  swelling  and redness in his left lower leg. He lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife and is retired from his job as an aircraft mechanic. He enjoys playing golf and mostly leads a sedentary lifestyle at home.  His social history includes being a former smoker who quit nearly 15 years ago. He drinks socially and reports having a couple of glasses of wine three to four times a week. He has no known drug allergies. He doesn't travel frequently and hasn't undergone any recent surgeries.  Mr. Arnold's past medical history is notable for hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for both of which he has been on medication for the last 10 years. He carries a diagnosis of obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) of 33. He has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases; his father had a stroke at age 70  and his eldest brother had a myocardial infarction at 65.  Over the past few days  Mr. Arnold noticed his left leg swelling. Initially attributed to a possible strain from his latest golf game  however  as the swelling intensified and the pain elevated  he reported a significant level of difficulty in walking.  On physical examination  the patient's left calf is noticeably swollen  warmer compared to the other leg  and tender upon palpation. A strong possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is considered given the classical symptoms  his age group  sedentary lifestyle  and the prevalent hypertension and diabetes.  Though DVT can present in any demographic  it is more commonly observed in older adults  particularly over the age of 65. Various studies have shown that factors such as obesity  a history of vascular diseases  and diabetes also increase the risk for DVT. Mr. Arnold's presentation is consistent with these observations in medical literature.   A duplex ultrasound has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the precise location and extent of the thrombus. Once confirmed  appropriate anticoagulant therapy will be initiated promptly. His management plan will also involve gaining better control of the existing morbidities  including potential lifestyle modifications and adjustments to his hypertension and type 2 diabetes medications.  Mr. Arnold's case underscores the importance of vigilant monitoring for the development of DVT in patients with risk factors  followed by prompt diagnostic investigation and structured therapeutic interventions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,60,Title: Presentation of a patient presenting with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction  - Subject: Our patient is a Caucasian  middle-aged (approximately 55)  female.  - Demographics: Studies suggest DVT incidence increases with age. Also  among Whites  the incidence is noticeably higher - approximately 1.3/1000 among those aged 50 and above  pointing to racial susceptibility.  Slide 2: Lifestyle factors  - Occupation: Sedentary work  her profession as a software engineer involves prolonged sitting. - Lifestyle: Occasionally travels for work  which involves long-haul flights.  - Smoking status: Ex-smoker  having quit 8 years ago. - Body Mass Index: Overweight with a BMI of 28. - Studies have linked these factors with increased risk of DVT.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  - History of recurrent miscarriage attributed to Antiphospholipid syndrome. - History suggestive of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome  although not clinically very significant manifestations. - History of varicose veins surgical treatment 10 years ago. - On a regular  low-dose contraceptive pill for heavy menstrual bleeding. - All these aspects have been associated with a heightened DVT risk.  Slide 4: Current Presentation  - Sudden onset  progressive lower right leg pain and swelling over a week. - Restless leg sensation  warmth and color changes of the affected leg.  - No associated chest pain  shortness of breath  or syncope at this time.  Slide 5: Initial Assessment  - Physical examination revealing asymmetrically swollen right leg with mild tenderness and warmth. - No obvious signs were detected on respiratory assessment. - These symptoms and signs triggered a suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 6: Suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis  - The patient’s profile  presentation  and risk factors align with features typically seen in DVT patients  reinforcing the need for further investigation.   Slide 7: Conclusion  In conclusion  managing such a patient calls for a comprehensive  co-existing conditions considerations  and the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach comprising endocrinologists  obstetricians  and vascular medicine specialists.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,61,"Patient Presentation:   We are currently caring for Mr. J.S.  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient hails from a suburban setting and is an ex-smoker.  Presenting Issue & Progress:  Mr. J.S. first noticed increasing pain and swelling in his right leg over the past week. He felt """"a bit off"""" but initially did not pay much attention to it. The swelling started exacerbating and presented alongside a purplish hue with moderate to severe tenderness when touched. There was no history of a recent leg injury or surgery.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J.S. has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but has been compliant with his prescribed medication regimen. His hypertension is well-controlled. The patient also has a past history of prostate cancer for which he underwent successful treatment five years ago. His family history reveals a brother who experienced a DVT at an older age.  Lifestyle:  Mr. J.S. is a retired engineer who lives with his wife. He has been less mobile than usual in recent months due to COVID-19 restrictions. He is overweight (BMI 30) due to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in saturated and trans fats.  Risk Factors:   Mr. J.S.'s clinical picture and risk factors including age  family history of DVT  overweight  sedentary lifestyle  restricted mobility  and history of cancer  make a compelling case for assessing him for DVT.  Course of Action:  The patient was sent for a Doppler ultrasound which confirmed the presence of DVT. Further examination and consultation with a vascular surgeon are currently underway to manage his condition and prevent potential complications  such as a pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion:  Mr. J.S. presents a common real-world picture of a DVT patient with broad implications for preventive health education and lifestyle modification guidance. His case emphasizes the importance of raising public awareness about the risk factors and early signs of DVT  particularly among senior citizens."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,62,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting a 60-year-old Caucasian male who's been recently diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The patient  Mr. Smith  is married  lives with his wife in suburban USA  and is retired from his job as a commercial truck driver.   Chief Complaint:  Mr. Smith presents with swelling  warmth  and pain in his right calf that started suddenly a few days ago.   Past Medical History (PMH): Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension controlled with amlodipine  obesity with a BMI of 32  and hyperlipidemia managed with simvastatin. He had a motor vehicle accident five years ago  which resulted in fractures but no known vascular injury. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking  but quit ten years ago. There's no history of cancer  diabetes  or any known hereditary clotting disorders. He's not currently on any kind of antithrombotic therapy. Family history includes a brother with DVT at the age of 65.  Review of Systems (ROS):  Recently the patient took a 12-hour flight which is significant for prolonged immobilization. He also noticed some shortness of breath with exertion and a slight  ongoing cough  but no hemoptysis. He has had no chest pain  palpitations  or recent illnesses.  Physical Examination: The patient appears well  in no acute distress. Cardiovascular exam is normal with regular rate and rhythm  no murmurs. The right lower extremity is notably swollen compared to the left; it's warm and tender to palpation  but there's no discoloration or ulceration. There's no palpable cord or Homan's sign. Breath sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Summary:  Mr. Smith's history and physical examination are highly suspicious for DVT  especially given his recent flight  obesity  hyperlipidemia  and past smoking history. The slightly worrisome symptoms of exertional dyspnea and cough may signify a possible Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  warranting further investigation. Immediate steps will include complete Blood Count  Coagulation profile  Duplex ultrasound of the affected leg  and potentially a CT angiography to rule out PE. His treatment will likely involve anticoagulation therapy.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,63,Slide 1: Patient Overview  We are presenting a 60-year-old African-American male patient. The patient is a former smoker and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. He is currently not engaged in any regular physical activity and is overweight with a BMI of 32.  Slide 2: Presenting Complaint  The patient arrived at the ER complaining of pain and swelling in his left leg that has been deteriorating over the past three days. The patient mentioned experiencing heaviness  warmth  redness and tenderness over the calf area.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on antihypertensive and statin medication for the past 10 years. Additionally  he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years back and is under pharmacological control.  Slide 4: Relevant History  The patient suffered from a mild stroke 3 years back  post which he has been on aspirin. He also had a hip replacement surgery approximately 1 month ago following a fall. The patient reports no known drug allergies.  Slide 5: Social History   Previously a heavy smoker  patient quit 5 years ago but consumed alcohol socially. He is a retired engineer with a sedentary lifestyle. He is married and has two children.  Slide 6: Assessment   Based on the symptoms  this patient is presenting with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). DVT predominantly develops among hyperlipidemis  hypertension patients and those with sedentary lifestyle. This patient's advanced age  obesity  recent hip replacement surgery  and family history of cardiovascular diseases are contributing risk factors.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Further diagnostic tests which include a D-dimer test  venous ultrasound  etc. are required to confirm our assessment. Prompt management with anticoagulation therapy is recommended following confirmation of diagnosis. It is also recommended for the patient to make substantial lifestyle modifications such as regular physical activity  healthier diet and weight loss to avoid recurring DVT and other potential health risks in the future. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,64,Presentation of Patient:  The patient is a 62-year-old male of Caucasian ethnicity  named John Doe  from an urban locality. Being a retired marketing analyst  his lifestyle often involves prolonged periods of sitting or inactivity. He is a former smoker and has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. Family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases  as his father suffered from a stroke and his mother passed away due to heart failure.  Relevant medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus (present for 15 years)  chronic hypertension and obesity with a BMI of 30.5 kg/m2. He previously had an uncomplicated right total knee replacement surgery five years back  after which he was not completely compliant with the post-operative mobilization protocols. He does not exercise regularly and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Today's presentation is characterized by a complaint of increasing pain  swelling and tenderness in his right lower leg  below the knee. The symptoms have been developing over the past three days. On observation  his right leg also appears to be slightly red and warm compared to the left. Upon physical examination  Homan's sign was positive.   Based on the patient's presentation and medical history  there is a high clinical suspicion of right-sided deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The demographic information provided is relatively representative of the typical profile of DVT patients - a condition more common among older age groups  in individuals with comorbid conditions (such as diabetes  obesity  and hypertension)  and those subjected to prolonged immobilization (in this case secondary to the patient's sedentary job and lifestyle).   Further diagnostic confirmation is essential through the use of Doppler ultrasound and/or venogram. Treatment plan would include anticoagulant use along with lifestyle modifications to reduce future thrombotic risks.                        
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,65,Patient Presentation:  This patient  Mr. John Davis  is a 48-year-old Caucasian male  married  with a sedentary job as a software engineer. He is a non-smoker and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol. He lives in an urban area and is usually driven to work. The patient is overweight  with a BMI of 28 and an overall sedentary lifestyle. The patient has no known drug allergies.  Medical Background:  Mr. Davis has a medical history of stroke two years ago  for which he remains on medication (clopidogrel  a blood-thinning antiplatelet drug  and atorvastatin  a cholesterol modemulator). He has known controlled hypertension as well  currently managed on a regimen of amlodipine. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Presenting Issue: He presented to the outpatient department with a 4-day history of progressive pain and swelling in his right calf. He indicated that he recently took a flight from a business trip  which lasted more than 8 hours followed by days of minimal movement and now complains of difficulty in walking due to the pain.   Clinical Evaluation:  On examination  his right lower leg was somewhat swollen and pink. He experienced pain upon flexing his foot upward (positive Homan's sign). PF D-dimer test was performed which returned positive.   Given the patient's clinical presentation and his risk factors (obesity  prolonged travel  previous stroke  sedentary lifestyle  family history of CVD)  a suspected diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was made.   Further evaluation with ultrasonography and anticoagulant therapy is planned. The patient has been counseled for lifestyle modifications including increased physical activity  healthier dietary habits  and weight control measures. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,66,Title: A Case Study of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile: Ms. Johnson is a 63-year-old African-American female from a lower socioeconomic background  hailing from the urban area of Washington D.C. She is a retired school teacher and lives alone since the passing of her husband. She has three adult children living out of state. She is an ex-smoker and consumes alcohol infrequently. Her body mass index (BMI) is 29  indicating obesity  and she leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History: Ms. Johnson has a known history of hypertension  which has been controlled with medication. She had a total knee-replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis six weeks ago. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with her mother succumbing to a heart attack and her father having battled with strokes. She does not have a personal or family history of malignancy or blood disorders.   Presenting Complaints: Ms. Johnson presented with acute  unilateral leg swelling  increased warmth and redness in her left calf  and pain in the calf muscles while walking or standing. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  lightheadedness  or syncope.  Conclusion: Based on her medical history  clinical symptoms  and demographic information (including her age  sex  race  BMI  recent surgery  and sedentary lifestyle)  Ms. Johnson is at a high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Obesity  age  recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  and hypertension are some of the major risk factors for DVT. Immediate diagnostic tests such as a Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer blood tests need to be ordered  and anticoagulant therapy should be initiated while awaiting the results to prevent pulmonary embolism and other complications. Furthermore  Ms. Johnson should be educated about the signs and dangers of pulmonary embolism. Long-term interventions should include lifestyle modifications such as increased physical activity  weight loss  and dietary changes for obesity and hypertension management.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,67,Title: Presentation of a Deep Vein Thrombosis Patient  Demographics  Our patient under consideration is a 67-year-old Caucasian female by the name of Mrs. Jane Smith. She is a retired school teacher and has been living in Newark  New Jersey  with her husband. She is a non-smoker and has occasional alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History  Mrs. Smith has a notable history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels for which she has been receiving treatment for the past 15 years. She does not have any history of cardiac events  nor has she been on any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.    Presenting Symptoms   Mrs. Smith presented with complaints of progressive swelling of her right calf over the last three days. The swelling was associated with a constant  dull ache and mild redness  but no fever or other systemic symptoms. There was a recent history of prolonged immobility following a back injury  which led to her being bedridden for about a week.   Clinical Assessment  On examination  her right calf was found to be swollen and tender when compared to the left one. There were no significant clinical signs of cellulitis or abscess. Based on her clinical picture  a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was suspected.  Investigations and Diagnosis  D-Dimer test was positive and a duplex ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of DVT  revealing a thrombus in the right posterior tibial vein. Her complete blood count  renal function tests  liver function tests  and coagulation profile were all within normal limits.   Discussion   According to current literature  the demographic characteristics of Mrs. Smith fit the typical profile of a DVT patient. Advanced age  prolonged immobilization due to her back injury  and a history of hypertension have likely contributed to her condition. Her presentation therefore provides classic learning points regarding DVT  highlighting the typical risk factors and symptoms.  References:  1. NICE (2012).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,68,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographic Information:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired engineer Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residential location: Urban region  Past medical history:   Mr. Johnson is a known case of Type II diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  hypertension for the past five years  and obesity  which he has struggled with for most of his adult life. He underwent knee replacement surgery about a month ago and has been relatively sedentary since. He is a former smoker and quit smoking five years back. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Presenting Complaints and Findings:   Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with complaints of a swollen  warm  and mildly painful left leg that started about two days ago and has been gradually getting worse. He denies recent injury  trauma or unusual physical exertion. He reports difficulty in walking due to the pain and swelling.  On physical examination  he has a swollen left lower leg; warm and erythematous possibly due to inflammation  with mild to moderate tenderness on palpation. Pulse in the affected leg was slightly weaker as compared to the other. His vital signs were within normal limits.  Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis:  Considering the presentation and medical history  there is a high index of suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The recent surgery  prolonged periods of immobility  age  diabetes  and hypertension put him at increased risk of developing DVT.  Plan:   Laboratory investigations including D-dimer levels  complete blood count (CBC)  PT/INR  and a lower extremity ultrasound have been ordered. Depending on the results  he may be commenced on anticoagulation therapy. Consultation with a vascular specialist is proposed if the diagnosis is confirmed.  This case presentation is consistent with literature  which shows that DVT often affects older adults  particularly those with various risk factors such as recent surgery  obesity  diabetes  hypertension  and prolonged periods of immobility.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,69,Title: Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged African American Female Patient   Demographic Information: Our patient is a 52-year-old African American female named Mrs. Veronica Bennett  from the urban neighborhood of Bronx  New York  who works as a long-haul truck driver. She has a documented BMI of 31  categorizing her as obese. She is a current smoker and reports of occasional alcohol consumption.  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Bennett presents with a complaint of increasing pain in her left leg which she noticed over the past three days. The pain is focused on her calf region and is associated with significant swelling  warmth  and a slightly reddened appearing skin. She denies any history of trauma or injury to the leg.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Bennett has a history of well-controlled hypertension  diagnosed five years ago  which is currently managed with lisinopril. Mrs. Bennett was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus about a year ago  controlled with metformin. She also has a history of multiple pregnancies  with her last childbirth around seven years ago. Her family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis wherein her mother had DVT at age 60. She does not have a personal history of prior DVT or pulmonary embolism. She has not had recent surgery or prolonged immobilization.   The demographic information and past medical history of Mrs. Bennett align with important risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  including obesity  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  family history of DVT  and a sedentary lifestyle associated with her occupation. Considering these risk factors and her presenting complaint  there is a high index of suspicion for DVT and thus  appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic actions should be initiated immediately.

He comes from a lower-middle-class background  is a retired postal clerk  and lives with his wife  who helps manage his affairs.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith visited the clinic complaining of unusual swelling  redness  and pain in his left lower leg that has gradually worsened over the last week. He denied any trauma  recent surgeries  or extensive travelling.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia  which he manages with dietary modification  exercise  and a regular dosage of Metformin and Statin drugs. He was a smoker for 35 years before quitting 7 years ago. Mr. Smith does not consume alcohol frequently  having one to two drinks during social events. His BMI is 28.5 and he has been trying to lose weight.  Family History:   There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his elder sister had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her late 50s.   Deep Vein Thrombosis:  Mr. Smith's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of DVT. His risk factors include his age  obesity  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of DVT.  For verification  further investigations such as D-Dimer test  ultrasound or other imaging studies may be warranted.   Considerations: Given his risk factors  consideration may be given to anti-thrombotic therapy as well as consultation with a hematology specialist. Management of Mr. Smith's DVT will also entail risk factor modification including weight and diabetes management  collaboration with his cardiologist  and education on recognizing symptoms of recurrence or complication like pulmonary embolism.  This patient presentation was created based on literature showing demographic representation for DVT. It is highlighted that DVT is often more likely in patients who are older  overweight  have a history of smoking  and have a family history of DVT or other cardiovascular diseases.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,71,Patient Presentation:   Patient Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 63 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Accountant Marital Status: Married Location: Chicago  Illinois  Chief Complaint: The patient presented with a 5-day history of pain  redness  and swelling in his left calf.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a diagnosed hypertensive patient for the last 7 years  managed initially with lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise  and later on medication. His blood pressure readings  however  have been within the acceptable range in the last year. No other significant medical history except for occasional migraine headaches. He also has familial history of PE (Pulmonary Embolism). Mr. Smith is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago  and admits to moderate alcohol consumption.   Review of Systems: Negative for fever  shortness of breath  or chest pain.   Current Medications: Lisinopril for hypertension  daily aspirin as recommended by his primary care physician  and over-the-counter ibuprofen as necessary for headaches.  Social History: The patient lives with his wife and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his office job. Mr. Smith just returned a week ago from a long flight from Australia.   Assessment: Based on symptoms including pain  swelling and erythema of left leg along with recent long haul flight and familial history of PE  a potential diagnosis could be Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).   This presentation pending further diagnostic studies would present a typical deep vein thrombosis patient as found in literature. The incidence of DVT is known to increase with age. Risk factors include a recent history of travel  hereditary predisposition  sedentary lifestyle  and personal history of hypertension.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,72,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  I. Demographic Information Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. E. He is a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history and does not use any illicit drugs or alcohol. He is a retired industrial worker  currently living with his wife in a suburban area. He is moderately overweight with a BMI of 27 and has a low activity level  being mostly sedentary.   II. Presenting Complaint Mr. E has presented with a three-day history of right leg pain and swelling. He indicates the pain is a dull ache located in the calf region and gets worse when standing or walking. He also reports feeling warm to the touch in the affected area.  III. Past Medical History Mr. E has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he is taking anti-hypertensive and statins. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been managing it through diet and oral medication for the past 8 years. Additionally  he has a history of varicose veins. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 67  and his mother had a stroke at age 70.  IV. Risk Factors Several established risk factors are present: advanced age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  a history of varicose veins  and significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His history of smoking and lack of exercise further increase his risk.   The patient's signs  symptoms  risk factors  age  and comorbidities point towards a high suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Despite constituting a relatively small proportion of patients with DVT  Caucasian males  particularly those above 60 years with prevalent lifestyle diseases and inactive lifestyles  are at significant risk. The most commonly reported symptoms among patients with DVT include leg pain and swelling  symptoms Mr. E presented with. Urgent evaluation is warranted in this case.  Reference: Heit  J. A. (2015).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,73,Patient Presentation:   I present to you Mr. James McDonald  a 67-year-old Caucasian male from rural Midwestern United States. He is a retired school teacher  weighs approximately 85 kg  and stands at height of 175 cm  leading to a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27.7. He has been married for 40 years  has three adult children  and is a non-smoker. Regarding socio-economic status  he is in the low to medium income bracket with a pension as his main source of income.  Medical History:  Mr. McDonald's medical history is significant  including chronic type II Diabetes Mellitus poorly controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents  and Hypertension controlled fairly well with ACE inhibitors. Over the past five years  he has recurrent history of venous stasis ulcers on his left lower leg  which indicates underlying chronic venous insufficiency. He also underwent a total right knee replacement eight months ago  largely due to osteoarthritis.  Presenting Condition:  Mr. McDonald presents to us today with complaints of increasingly severe pain and swelling in his left leg over the past week. The pain is in his calf and thigh  with the calf pain resembling a cramping sensation. He reports that the pain is more pronounced upon physical movement  especially when walking. He also mentions a noticeable warm sensation over the calf region  but denies any open sores or discharges. He reports that he has been progressively less mobile due to the discomfort  which has resulted in his dependence on his wife for getting around and attending to his basic needs.  On physical examination  his left lower leg is indeed swelling and red  with increased temperature compared to the right side. His pulse rates are within the normal range  and his respiratory rate is slightly increased.   Given his prior history of venous insufficiency  recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  advanced age  and current symptoms  there is high clinical suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Mr. McDonald appears to be a classic case  as the likelihood of developing DVT increases with age  and his other risk factors are widely recognized. He needs immediate diagnostic testing for confirmation and appropriate treatment to reduce the risk of possibly fatal pulmonary embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,74,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis - A Case Study Presentation  Patient Profile:  Patient's Name: Mr. William Johnson Demographics: Age: 65 years  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Veteran (previously sedentary job) Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Urban area  Past medical History: - Chronic smoker for 40 years  - Obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32 - Hypertensive  on medication - Underwent total knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago  Presenting Complaints: The patient visited the emergency department with complaints of: - Progressive onset of localized swelling in the left lower leg over the past week - Warmth and tenderness over the area - Reddish discoloration of the afflicted leg - Difficulty in walking due to pain and discomfort  Given his recent surgery  these symptoms indicate a high suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  a condition that is more common among older adults  particularly those with risk factors such as surgery  obesity  prolonged immobility and hypertension.  Upon physical examination  the left leg appeared swollen and red compared to the right  and there was a pain on palpation.   To diagnose the condition  a D-Dimer test and subsequent ultrasound were ordered. The outcomes of these tests would be paramount in determining the presence and severity of DVT in the patient's left leg.  If diagnosed  the patient will likely benefit from anticoagulant therapy to dissolve the clot and prevent further occurrences. However  the treatment plan will be firmed up based on the diagnosis and the health profile of the patient.   Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments will be necessary to prevent potential complications  like Pulmonary Embolism.   Lifestyle modifications will also be suggested  such as quitting smoking  adopting a healthier diet for weight loss  and general physiotherapy for enhanced mobility and blood flow.   This case illustrates the importance of incorporating a thorough patient assessment and history taking  especially in individuals with multiple risk factors  to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,75,Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  - Patient Name: John Smith - Age: 60 Years old - Sex: Male - Height: 5’10” - Weight: 220 lbs. - Occupation: Accountant  Demographic Information: Mr. Smith is of Caucasian ethnicity and resides in an urban setting. He is a college graduate and lives with his wife and two children. His lifestyle is relatively sedentary due to his deskbound job and his preferred leisure activities include watching television and reading.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has a background of Type 2 Diabetes that is controlled by metformin. He also has a history of hypertension which is managed by lisinopril  and hypercholesterolemia controlled with atorvastatin.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith presents with unilateral leg swelling  specifically in his left lower leg. The swelling has been increasing progressively over the past few days. The patient mentions a constant  dull aching pain in the affected leg. He also reports feeling warmth over the area of swelling and discoloration in the skin - it appears a bit redder than the other leg.  Risk Factors Present: Given Mr. Smith's history  several risk factors can be identified. This includes his sedentary lifestyle  obesity (BMI 31.6)  existing comorbid conditions of Diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He has no known family history of DVT or other relevant conditions.   Preliminary Diagnosis:  Based on these symptoms and risk factors  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is suggested.   This presentation is a typical case of DVT. DVT has a higher prevalence in individuals over 50  and males. Physical inactivity due to deskbound jobs  existing diabetes  and hypertension are common risk factors as per medical literature. It's important to note that diagnosis should be confirmed through medical imaging  preferably Doppler Ultrasound  and appropriate treatment should begin promptly to prevent potential complications like pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,76,Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis    Demographics:  Patient John Doe is a 53-year-old  Caucasian male  currently employed as a truck driver. He resides in a suburban setting and is a smoker with a 30-pack year smoking history. He reports no alcohol or drug use. He lives with his wife and two children.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a past medical history of long standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed 7 years ago  currently managed with antihypertensive medications and statin therapy. Furthermore  he also has obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 54.  Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents today with a swelling in his left leg which he has noticed gradually increasing over the past week. Additionally  he mentions experiencing pain in the swollen leg  describing it as ‘aching’ and ‘cramping’  primarily in the calf area. He reports no shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  or fever. However  he did mention experiencing recent sedentary behavior due to long haul truck drives at his job. His daily routine involves sitting for prolonged periods  with limited opportunities for walking or stretching.  Considering the patient's demographics  clinical presentation  past medical history  and lifestyle factors  a provisional diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is considered. DVT is a serious condition  primarily affecting the large veins in the lower leg and thigh. It’s more common in older adults  and risk factors include immobility (as in Mr. Doe's professional lifestyle)  obesity  smoking  certain underlying conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and a positive family history.  Further diagnostic workup needs to be performed  including a D-dimer test and color Doppler ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is confirmed  the treatment goal for John would be to prevent the clot from getting bigger  prevent the clot from breaking off and moving to his lungs  and reduce the risk of future clots. This will include anticoagulant medication and lifestyle modifications. Referral to a vascular specialist might be necessary for further evaluation and management.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,77,Slide 1: Patient Overview  We are discussing a 65-year-old Caucasian female who has recently been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). She is a retired office worker living in rural Wisconsin  United States. She has a history of sedentary behavior and a 20 year history of smoking  though she quit 10 years ago.   Slide 2: History of Present Illness   Our patient started complaining of a sudden onset of pain and swelling in her left leg. The pain got worse when she was standing or walking. She also reported warmth over the area and redness of the skin.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   She has a history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus type II  and hyperlipidemia. Unfortunately  her compliance to prescribed medications (metformin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril) is poor. She also has a history of varicose veins.   Slide 4: Family and Social History  The patient's father had a history of stroke  and her mother died from a heart attack. She lives alone and admits that her physical activity is minimal. Her nutritional status is poor  with most meals consisting of processed and fast foods.  Slide 5: Current Medications   The patient is currently on metformin for her diabetes  atorvastatin for her high cholesterol  and Lisinopril for her hypertension.   Slide 6: Risk Factors  In summary  the risk factors for developing DVT in this patient include her age  personal history of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obesity  as well as a sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and a family history of cardiovascular disease.   Slide 7: Conclusion   The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy after diagnostic confirmation of DVT. She has been counseled on the importance of medication compliance and maintaining good glycemic and blood pressure control. She was also advised to increase physical activity  maintain a balanced diet  and avoid prolonged periods of immobility.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,78,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith is a 68 year-old Caucasian male  presenting with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). John has been experiencing increasing pain and swelling in his right lower leg over the past few days  which worsens with physical activities. He also exhibited skin discoloration around the area. However  no observable symptoms of general unwellness is noted such as fever or shortness of breath.  John is retired  lives with his wife  and he has been generally active. He quit smoking 10 years ago  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a diet high in saturated fats. His family history is positive for thromboembolic diseases. His sister experienced a pulmonary embolism in her late 60s.  Past Medical History:  John is diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. He has been managing his diabetes with Metformin and his hypertension with Lisinopril. Both conditions have been reasonably controlled  but his compliance to lifestyle modification has been poor. He also has a history of prostate cancer which was treated with surgical removal five years ago. He is on low-dose aspirin for prophylaxis.   About 10 days prior to the onset of his current symptoms  John underwent a right total knee replacement surgery at another hospital. The surgery was uneventful  and he was discharged home on post-operative day 3.  The present picture with a history of recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  Cancer history  diabetes  and high fat diet  makes him an ideal candidate for possible DVT. These risk factors contribute to an increased chance of blood clot formation as indicated in abundant clinical literature. Further diagnostic efforts should be directed towards confirmed diagnosis of DVT  evaluation of possible pulmonary embolism as a complication  and correction of modifiable risk factors. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,79,Title: CASE PRESENTATION OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Jane Davis Age: 65 years Gender: Female Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Geographic Location: Seattle  Washington  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Davis presents with swelling in the left lower leg that started gradually over the last four days. The leg is noticeably warm and tender to the touch  with a level of discomfort rated at 6 on the pain rating scale of 0-10. She reports difficulty in walking due to the pain and swelling.  Medical History: Mrs. Davis has a well-documented medical history. She is obese with a BMI of 31  and she is also hypertensive  with blood pressure currently controlled under medication. There is a history of Type II diabetes for which she is taking oral hypoglycemics. She was previously diagnosed with varicose veins three years ago  but did not have any surgery.  In terms of her family history  her mother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at an older age  thereby making her genetically predisposed.  Recent History: Mrs. Davis had a right total hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. Post-surgery  she remained sedentary most of the time due to fear of falling  and did not participate in the physiotherapy that was recommended.  Current Medications: Anti-hypertensives- Lisinopril 10mg once daily   Oral Hypoglycemic- Metformin 500mg twice daily.  Review & Assessment: Considering the recent surgery  the family history  the prolonged immobilization  and current signs and symptoms  there is a strong clinical suspicion of left lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Mrs. Davis. Further clinical and investigational assessments are planned to confirm the suspicion and to rule out potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.  Although DVT can affect anyone  certain factors like age  obesity  surgery  sedentary lifestyle  and genetics increase the risk. Statistically  DVT is more common in Caucasian women over 60 years old who are overweight or obese.   Conclusively  this case presentation emphasizes the importance of preventive measures such as regular movement and physiotherapy  particularly after surgeries to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis  especially in high-risk populations  as represented by Mrs. Davis.  Next Steps: Diagnostic tests including D-Dimer blood test and Doppler ultrasound of the lower limb  as well as consultation with a vascular specialist are advised for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,80,Title: Presentation of a Patient Presenting with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Introduction We're discussing a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting with characteristic symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a retired truck driver who lives with his wife in a suburban region. He is a non-smoker but has a history of alcohol consumption  currently at moderate levels.  Slide 3: Medical History This patient has a known diagnosis of Type II diabetes and hypertension  both being managed via pharmacotherapy. He has a history of sedentary lifestyle with prolonged periods of immobilization due to his past occupation.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  He visited the clinic citing a one-week history of progressive left lower extremity swelling and pain. He also mentioned a slight elevation in temperature and increased fatigue.   Slide 5: Deep Vein Thrombosis  DVT is a blood clot in a deep vein  usually in the legs. This condition may lead to post-thrombotic syndrome  pulmonary embolism  and even death if left untreated.  Slide 6: Risk Factors in the Patient Our patient's sedentary lifestyle  along with his advancing age  hypertension  and diabetes poses high risk for DVT. Additionally  his alcohol consumption could also contribute to his dehydration status  exacerbating the risk.  Slide 7: Conclusion In conclusion  given the patient's symptoms and risk factor profile  a comprehensive investigation  including imaging studies and blood tests  should be performed to confirm the DVT diagnosis  and to rule out other diagnoses. Once confirmed  appropriate treatment  preventive measures for future clot development  and patient education should be delivered.  Slide 8: References This slide includes any references utilized to create the case study presentation  further highlighting the credibility and reliability of the information presented.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,81,Patient Presentation:  Today I'm presenting Mr. Jack Curtis  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who is a resident of Seaside  Oregon. Mr. Curtis is a retired Navy officer and a non-smoker  and his BMI suggests overweight  around 27. He reports being fairly sedentary since his retirement and has a history of occasional alcohol intake.   Mr. Curtis presents with complaints of swelling  pain  and warmth in his left lower leg  symptoms that began approximately two days ago. The pain seems to intensify when he stands or walks. There is no obvious trauma  bleeding  or visual skin infection presented in the area.   His past medical history reveals that he is a diagnosed Type II Diabetic  and he has been on metformin for the past 10 years. He also has a history of hypertension from the last 5 years  which is managed by amlodipine and lisinopril. His family history includes his father who suffered from a stroke at age 75 and a brother with a history of pulmonary embolism.   In addition to these  other relevant medical history is that Mr. Curtis underwent a total knee replacement on his right leg three years ago  after which he had an uneventful course of recovery. However  he did not participate in regular physical activity post-surgery. Importantly  he has taken two long-haul flights (over 4 hours) in the past month.   Upon clinical examination  there is no immediate distress  but clear discomfort while mobilizing  primarily related to the left calf area. The left lower leg is visibly swollen and slightly erythematous as compared to the right. The calves are asymmetrical in size  with the left being 3cm larger in circumference at the widest point.   Mr. Curtis’ presentation is most consistent with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). His age  sedentary lifestyle  recent long-haul flights  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  knee surgery  and family history of thromboembolic events put him at high risk for DVT. Precise diagnostic testing like a D-Dimer test  followed by ultrasound examination of the lower limbs  will clarify the presumption.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,82,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  I. Demographics: Patient Name: Ms. Jane Doe Age: 63 years Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired nurse Country of Residence: United States of America  II. Patient History:  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Doe presented with a three-day history of progressive pain and swelling in her left lower leg. She noticed the pain is worsening when she stands or walks around her home and is slightly relieved by elevating the leg. She also reported a general sense of malaise.  Past Medical History: Ms. Doe has a 5-year history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes mellitus two years ago. Both conditions are well-controlled with medication  including telmisartan for her hypertension and metformin for diabetes.  Family History: The patient has a positive familial history of cardiovascular diseases  particularly her mother who suffered from a stroke at the age of 70.  Social History: Ms. Doe is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. She admits to leading a mostly sedentary lifestyle  given her retirement status and physical activities limited mainly to gardening.  Travel History:  Ms. Doe recently returned from a month-long road trip across the country. She describes being sedentary for several hours during the long drives.   III. Differential Diagnosis: Provisional diagnosis considering the clinical symptoms  and her recent prolonged travel is a deep vein thrombosis. Other possible diagnoses need to be excluded such as cellulitis  calf strain  and Baker cyst rupture.   In summary  we are dealing with a 63-year-old retired female patient with controlled hypertension and diabetes  who presents with a unilateral swollen calf and recent history of prolonged car travel  likely indicative of deep vein thrombosis. Prompt investigation and intervention are required to confirm the diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,83,Title: Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  I. Demographic Information: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who has been living in the urban setting of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania. He is a retired engineer who has been leading a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. His BMI is 30.5 classifying him as obese. He is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago but has a 30-year smoking history.   II. Chief Complaint: The patient presented with complaints of pain and swelling in his right lower leg that has progressively increased over the last two days. He also reports a feeling of warmth and redness over the area  with faint discomfort when walking.  III. Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension that has been well-managed by medication (lisinopril) for the past 15 years. Apart from this  his medical history includes occasional bouts of gout but he has not had an attack in the last year. He has never had surgeries or hospital admissions apart from treatment for a small car accident 20 years ago.  IV. Family History: The patient reported that his father had coronary heart disease  and his mother suffered from type 2 diabetes. There is no known family history of any hematological condition or venous thromboembolism.  V. Personal History: The patient lives with his wife and is generally sedentary  apart from daily walks with their dog. He consumes alcohol moderately and denies any illicit drug use. He has been adhering to a high-fat diet for the majority of his adult life.  VI. Recent Activity: The patient flew back from a visit to his son in California three days ago  a trip involving about 5 hours of flight time which he admits to having spent seated. This information is significant as prolonged immobilization  such as long flights or bed rest  can pose a risk for DVT.  Summary: This patient's age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  history of long flights  and his previous smoking history  along with his current symptoms of leg pain  swelling  and warmth  suggest a potential diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The medical history of hypertension  although well-managed  increases his risk for DVT. Therefore  this case will need to be further evaluated and confirmed by necessary investigations  and if required  managed appropriately to prevent complications  such as pulmonary embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,84,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson. He is a resident of Dallas  Texas  where he lives with his wife. He formerly served in the army but is currently working as an accountant. He smokes up to a pack of cigarettes daily  and his alcohol consumption is  by his account  moderate.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of increasing pain and swelling in his right lower limb. He described the pain as dull aching  non-radiating  and exacerbated by walking.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has been hypertensive for 10 years treated with Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  managed with Metformin. He underwent a total knee arthroplasty on his right knee two weeks ago after an injury while gardening. He has a history of intermittent claudication but no previous history of venous thromboembolism. His family history revealed his father suffered a pulmonary embolism in his sixties.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed an edematous  erythematous  warm  and tender right calf which measured 3 cm more in circumference than the left. There was a positive Homan's sign. His vitals were stable with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 88 bpm  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and temperature of 37.3 C. Auscultation of the heart  lungs  and abdomen was unremarkable. His BMI was calculated to be 29 indicating overweight.  Investigations: A D-dimer test was positive. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal vein.   This case presentation depicts an individual with multiple risk factors for the development of DVT—including recent surgery  obesity  smoking  hypertension  and diabetes—thus embodying the typical high-risk profile characterized in the literature.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,85,"Title: A Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Profile:  The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian female named Ms. Smith  who is originally from Denver  Colorado. Ms. Smith is a divorced homemaker with two grown children.   Health History: Ms. Smith was overweight and led a sedentary lifestyle  with a body mass index (BMI) of 28. She is a former smoker  having quit five years ago. She has a medical history of Type II diabetes and hypertension  both managed with medication  but with inconsistent control. Her medications include Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. Ms. Smith also has a familial history of cardiovascular disease; her mother had a stroke at age 75  and her father had his first heart attack at age 68.  Presentation: Ms. Smith presented to the emergency department with symptoms that had begun two days ago  including swelling  pain  and warmth over the left calf area. The pain is described as a dull ache that worsens with walking and leg elevation. Ms. Smith also mentioned that she had just returned from a long international flight twelve days ago.  Investigations: Physical examination revealed left calf circumference was 3 cm greater than the right calf  warmth over the area (left calf)  and extensive edema. Lower extremity Duplex ultrasound showed a non-compressible left popliteal vein  consistent with a diagnosis of DVT. Other lab results showed elevated D-Dimer levels  but liver function tests  kidney function tests  CBC  and coagulation profile were largely unremarkable.  Clinical Impression: Given the patient's medical and family history  recent lengthy travel  clinical findings  and investigation results  she was diagnosed with acute left-sided deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Treatment: Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)  followed by oral warfarin. Patient education on DVT  its risks  importance of medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications such as achieving a healthy BMI  maintaining regular physical activity  and controlling her underlying conditions (diabetes  hypertension) were emphasized. Ms. Smith will have regular follow-ups for INR checks and to manage her diabetes and hypertension.   In conclusion  Ms. Smith's case underscores the importance of recognizing the interplay of both genetic and lifestyle factors in DVT development  especially in patients with existing co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,86,Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Our patient  Mr. Thomas Smith  is a 62-year old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is a retired truck driver who has been generally in good health  but has been experiencing unusual leg pain for the last four days. His occupation consisted of long hours of seated immobility  a risk factor for the development of DVT.   Mr. Smith currently lives in Chicago  Illinois with his wife of 37 years  Mrs. Linda Smith. He has two grown children and three grandchildren. His lifestyle is moderately active  he walks for half an hour daily and enjoys swimming on weekends. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially.   As per the report  Mr. Smith has been experiencing a persistent calf pain  and his left leg appears slightly swollen and red. He also described feeling warmth over the affected area. He stated the pain worsens when he stands or walks. He initially believed the pain was a muscle strain  but with its persistence and worsening  he thought it necessary to seek medical advice.  In terms of past medical history  Mr. Smith had a moderately severe myocardial infarction (heart attack) six years ago  for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He takes regular medications which include a low-dose aspirin and a statin. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is not known to have diabetes  cancer  or any blood clotting disorders.   Mr. Smith’s father had a history of stroke at the age of 75  which makes a genetic predisposition possible for thromboembolic diseases.   In summary  Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a risk profile suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. His predisposing factors include his age  prior history of heart disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  potential genetic predisposition  as well as prolonged periods of immobility due to his occupation. Considering the typical symptoms and the presence of several risk factors for DVT  immediate diagnostic testing is advised to confirm the suspected diagnosis. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,87,Presentation Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in an Elderly Female Patient  Slide 1: Patient Introduction We are presenting the case of a 75-year-old African-American female who presents with a complaint of acute onset left leg swelling and pain for the past 48 hours. She also reports feelings of warmth over the affected area and slight shortness of breath.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics This patient represents a common demographic for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The condition is prevalent in patients above 60 years. Furthermore  multiple studies indicate African-Americans have a higher rate of DVT when compared with other racial/ethnic groups.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 5 years ago for which she was placed on aspirin for anticoagulation. She has had no previous episodes of thrombosis and no known family history of thrombotic events. She is a non-smoker and has moderate alcohol use.   Slide 4: Current Medications The patient is currently on Metformin for Diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin for atrial fibrillation.  Slide 5: Possible Risk Factors This patient's risk factors primarily consist of her age  African-American ethnicity  her diagnosed hypertension and diabetes  and atrial fibrillation.   Slide 6: Discussion  In conclusion  this case exemplifies the importance of appropriate assessment and early intervention in elderly patients presenting with signs of DVT. Considering her age  pre-existing medical conditions  and ethnicity  she presents a high-risk profile for DVT. It is essential that preventative strategies and risk assessment tools are utilized to reduce the risk of DVT in such patients. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,88,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient: Mr. Rodriguez  Age: 68 Years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Mr. Rodriguez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the outpatient clinic with a three-day history of progressive swelling and persistent pain in his left lower extremity. The pain is described as a dull ache  increased with walking  and somewhat relieved with elevation of the limb.  Mr. Rodriguez is diabetic and hypertensive  both conditions diagnosed twelve years ago and fairly well-controlled with medication. Five years ago  he had a transient ischemic attack but recovered well with no residual deficits. His BMI falls in obese category (BMI = 31). He has a 30-pack year smoking history but quit about ten years ago.   Despite his health issues  he maintained a reasonably active lifestyle until quite recently. Over the past six months  however  he noticed increasing fatigue and shortness of breath with his regular walking routine. In today's visit  Mr. Rodriguez also mentioned a recent long-distance travel (flight journey of approximately 8 hours)  post which he started noticing these symptoms.  He reports no known allergies  and his current medication regimen is metformin for type 2 diabetes  losartan for hypertension  and aspirin for primary stroke prevention.  Based on these symptoms  Mr. Rodriguez's past medical history  and his risk factors such as age  obesity  diabetes  and recent long-distance travel  there is a strong suspicion of deep vein thrombosis. Further investigations  including a Doppler ultrasound  would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,89,Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Today  I'd like to present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Patient Demographics: Research shows that DVT tends to be more common in older adults  especially those above the age of 60 years. The incidence also appears to be slightly higher in males compared to females. Our patient's demographic background  therefore  is representative of the typical DVT patient population. Further demographic breakdown reveals that he's a retired manual laborer living in a suburban area. He's a widower and has two grown-up children.  Medical History: In terms of past medical history  the patient has a known case of hypertension  which has been controlled with medication. He underwent a knee replacement surgery about a year ago. Postoperatively  he also developed a blood clot in the same leg  which resolved following a course of anticoagulants. He is also a former smoker but quit about 20 years ago.  Recent Presentation: He has recently presented with pain and swelling in the left leg  which is his operative leg. He reports that the pain significantly increases when he stands and tries to walk. He has experienced no recent trauma to the affected limb and denies any changes in medication  alcohol use  or recent traveling.  On physical examination  there was significant pitting edema of the left leg. His heart rate and blood pressure were within normal limits  and lung examination revealed no abnormal findings. An ultrasound doppler was subsequently performed  which confirmed the presence of a blood clot in a deep vein of the left leg consistent with DVT.  In summary  considering his age  past history of surgery  and earlier DVT incidence  the patient exemplifies important elements of pathophysiology related to DVT  and further exemplifies the importance of risk stratification and early management for this serious condition in primary care.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,90,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis - Patient Presentation   I. Introduction  The presentation will focus on a patient with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common yet dangerous venous thromboembolic event in which a thrombus forms in the deep veins  typically within the lower extremities.  II. Demographics  Our illustrative patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  John  representative of the typical age and racial demographic for DVT as per literature. DVT is more common among the elder aged 60 and over  with rates higher in males compared to females. Caucasians are at a slightly higher risk for DVT compared to the liquid population.  III. Past Medical History  John leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle  he's a retired office worker and his physical activities are minimal. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both controlled through medication. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. Unfortunately  he recently experienced a hip fracture during a fall  which required post-surgical immobilization. This combination of factors  particularly the recent orthopedic surgery  places John at an increased risk for DVT.  IV. Presenting Symptoms  John reports having noticed swelling in his left leg for the past week. The swelling has been progressively worsening  making it difficult for him to walk comfortably. He also mentions experiencing a dull ache in his leg  especially when standing for extended periods. He hasn't recorded any fever  nor has there been any noticeable discoloration in the area.  V. Conclusion  Given the clinical presentation and past medical history  a provisional diagnosis of DVT is quite prudent. It is necessary to conduct further diagnostic procedures  including ultrasound imaging  D-dimer testing  and possibly anticoagulant treatment  under the direct guidance of a healthcare specialist.  Through this presentation  we aim to emphasize the importance of recognizing the risk factors  including ageing  sedentary lifestyle  past surgical procedures  and certain chronic conditions  to effectively diagnose and manage DVT. Early identification of these factors and patient complaints can ensure better prognosis and hopefully  prevent the occurrence of a fatal pulmonary embolism.   This case underlines the quintessential need for preventative measures  especially among high-risk groups  to prevent DVT and its associated complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,91,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 64-year-old White Caucasian female with a history of obesity and sedentary lifestyle who presents with unilateral  severe and painful swelling in her right lower leg. She reported a subjective fever and stated that the swelling has been progressively increasing for the past two weeks. She is a non-smoker  reports occasional alcohol use  and has a family history of deep vein thrombosis.  Patient History:  Past medical history is significant for Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  well controlled with diet  metformin  and lisinopril therapy. She underwent total knee arthroplasty on her right knee three years ago. She denies any history of malignancy  autoimmune diseases  or coagulopathies. Family history is significant for first-degree relatives having deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.   Social History:  She worked as a school teacher for 30 years and has been retired for 4 years now. She lives with her husband and is generally sedentary with limited physical activities since she retired  possibly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions.   Demographic Details:  It's noted in the latest data that deep vein thrombosis is relatively common in the Caucasian population and women are slightly more likely to be affected. The patient’s age also puts her at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis  as the risk tends to increase with age particularly after 60 years. Further  factors like obesity  history of surgery  sedentary lifestyle  diabetes  and hypertension increase her risk of developing thrombosis.    For this patient  it is crucial to initiate immediate therapeutic interventions following accurate diagnosis  given her increased risk profile and characteristic presentation. The patient will also benefit from education regarding lifestyle modifications and preventive measures.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,92,Title: Case Study of a Patient Presenting with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Presentation:   The patient is Mrs. Brenda Clarke  a 67-year-old Caucasian female from rural Minnesota. She is retired  lives alone but has a good social system as she has her children living nearby. They confirm there is no hereditary risk in the family.   Past Medical and Social History:  Her past medical history includes Obesity (BMI 30)  high blood pressure (hypertension) being controlled with Lisinopril 10mg daily  and she quit smoking ten years ago. She does not consume alcohol. She had a total knee replacement surgery 1 month ago. There is no known allergy.   Recent Health Status:  Mrs. Clarke presented to the ER complaining about warmth  redness  and painful swelling in her right lower leg  which she first noticed three days ago. She thought it would go away but the discomfort increased over time. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath or any neurological symptoms.  Medical Literature:  According to literature  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidents are more common among patients above 60 years. Particularly  postoperative patients are at higher risk. Studies also tell us that DVT is more common among caucasians and obese individuals. Hypertension is found to be a risk factor  even though the association is weaker. Lastly  smoking favours coagulation and inhibits fibrinolysis  making ex-smokers more susceptible to DVT.   Risk Factors:  In the case of Mrs. Clarke  her risk factors include older age  recent knee replacement surgery  obesity  hypertension  and a history of smoking. This  along with her presenting symptoms  makes DVT a high possibility. Immediate diagnosis  typically using ultrasound followed by suitable treatment including anticoagulants  is advisable to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism.   Patient Education:  Mrs. Clarke needs to be educated about lifestyle changes to prevent future DVT  including maintaining a healthy weight  increased physical activity  and blood pressure control. She needs to be taught symptoms of Pulmonary embolism to seek immediate medical help if experienced. She should continue her prescribed anticoagulant medications to prevent the formation of new clots and growth of existing ones.   Team Communication:  Prompt communication with the interdisciplinary team including primary physician  orthopaedic  dietician  physiotherapist  and nurse is necessary to devise a comprehensive management plan including anticoagulation  diet plan  and regular exercise regimen. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,93,Title: Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Patient   Patient Information:   Mr. Brown is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Presentation Information:  Mr. Brown reports he recently took a long-distance flight before noticing a swelling in his left lower leg for the past few days. The patient also complains of tenderness and warmth over the same leg in addition to slight pain when walking. Mr. Brown does not report chest pain or dyspnea. He mentions noticing his leg changed color to a bluish-purple and felt harder than usual.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has a recorded history of type 2 diabetes  managed by oral hypoglycemic agents  and high cholesterol for which he's taking statins. He underwent a total knee replacement surgery two years ago. He also reports a family history of venous thromboembolism. Mr. Brown is a former smoker and has been alcohol abstinent for five years.   Socioeconomic History:  He is retired and lives with his wife in a suburban community. His wife reports that he enjoys reading and gardening but has been relatively inactive since his knee surgery.   Current Medications:  Mr. Brown's current medications include Metformin and Atorvastatin. He is not on any anticoagulant medication.   This presentation and the patient’s demographics are consistent with the epidemiological data  which show that DVT incidence increases with age and is more common in males. Additionally  known risk factors for DVT including recent travel  post-surgical status  personal and family history of thromboembolism  diabetes  high cholesterol  and sedentary lifestyle are present.  This warrants a thorough evaluation for deep vein thrombosis to rule out the same and initiate prompt treatment if confirmed to avert any severe complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,94,Patient Presentation:  I'd like to present a case of a 60-year-old Caucasian female patient who was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient lives in an urban environment and was mostly sedentary  owing to her jobs as an accountant. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 30  which categorizes her as overweight.   Her past medical history reveals early onset type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which have been fairly well-controlled with medication over the years. Patient also has a genetic history of thrombotic disease  as her father had pulmonary embolism. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery about a month ago  after which she was mostly immobile due to progressive knee pain.   The patient reported to the clinic with acute onset of pain in her left lower leg which was stated as a heavy ache along with swelling  warmth  and redness over the area. The pain was reportedly accentuated on walking and rated as 7/10 in severity. She denied chest discomfort  shortness of breath  hemoptysis  or palpitations.   Given the reported symptoms consistent with that of deep vein thrombosis  the physical immobility  her genetic predisposition and her recent knee surgery  she was diagnosed with DVT after appropriate diagnostics including a Doppler ultrasonography. She has been immediately started on anticoagulant therapy aimed at preventing the formation of new clots and preventing the current clot from becoming larger.   This case exhibits some important risk factors for deep vein thrombosis  such as her age  her overweight status  her type 2 diabetes and hypertension  her recent knee operation  and her long period of inactivity due to knee pain. She has no history of cancer and has taken birth control in the past. Consequently  regular follow-ups with her primary care physician and careful response to medication are crucial in her case.

Slide 8: Physical Examination - Presence of edema  warmth  and tenderness characterized the physical exam of his left lower extremity. The rest of the physical examination was normal.  Slide 9: Conclusion - Given his symptoms  medical history  and risk factors  we suspect deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further diagnostic testing will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and to consider appropriate treatment options.  Slide 10: References - Any relevant references used for the presentation.   Please note that African-American ethnicity and older age are associated with increased risk of DVT. Male sex and occupations requiring prolonged immobilization like truck driving could also elevate the risk. Conditions like hypertension and diabetes can contribute to the development of DVT. The above depicted case is thus a representative demographic profile as per the literature.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,97,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in Middle-aged Caucasian Male  Introduction: Presenting a case of a 53-year-old male  Mr. John Park  who has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He is a Caucasian from Los Angeles  California  working in a white-collar job with a sedentary lifestyle.   Demographic Information: Mr. Park is married with two children and lives in a suburban locality. He does not have any habits of substance use  such as smoking or alcohol consumption. His diet consists mostly of processed food  and he has a low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Past Medical history: Mr. Park was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  and he is currently under medication with Metformin. He also has a history of hypertension  controlled with antihypertensives. There's no known genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases within his family. However  Mr. Park had a sedentary lifestyle for the last 10 years  with little or no physical activity  possibly contributing to his current vascular condition.  Presenting Complaints: He presented to the ER with complaints of tenderness  swelling  and pain in his left lower leg  which gradually developed over a week. As the pain became acute and mobility was impaired  it triggered him to seek medical care.  Preliminary Diagnosis: As per the physical examination and Doppler ultrasonography  deep vein thrombosis has been confirmed.   Conclusion: Considering Mr. Park's past medical history  his current sedentary lifestyle and recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis  immediate intervention and lifestyle modification are strongly recommended with necessary pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment to manage the existing condition and prevent further complications.  This case represents the large demographic of middle-aged  sedentary adults with lifestyle induced co-morbidities who are at high risk of DVT. Consequently  the importance of regular exercise  healthy dietary habits and regular health check-ups cannot be emphasized enough in this demographic group.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,98,Title: A Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Profile:  Patient Initials: J.S  Sex: Female  Age: 58  Race & Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Office clerk  Location: Urban area  Midwest USA   Presenting Issue:  The patient presents with unilateral swelling and discomfort in her left leg - noticeable redness  warmth  and tenderness along the course of the vein. The symptoms started gradually  about a week ago.   Medical History:  The patient has a known medical history of obesity and hypertension. She also states that she has been relatively immobile in recent weeks due to her desk job and due to COVID-19 stay-at-home measurements. Her BMI is within the obese range. She had a surgical procedure (hysterectomy) more than a decade ago. There is no reported history of smoking or alcohol abuse  however  the patient has been on birth control pills for hormone replacement therapy since her surgery.   Family History:  Her mother suffered from varicose veins and her father had a history of coronary artery disease. Both maternal and paternal grandparents had stroke histories.  Assessment:  Given the patient's presenting symptoms and her personal medical history along with the family history of cardiovascular diseases  the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected.  Note:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition  affecting approximately 1 in 1 000 persons per year  with comparable incidence across the developed world. Approximately two-thirds of DVT cases occur in individuals aged over 60 years  and incidence decreases with youth. Evidence shows DVT can disproportionately affect individuals with a history of obesity  hypertension  prolonged immobility or use of hormonal pills  as seen in this patient.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,99,Title: A Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male identified as Mr. X. He is a resident of Chicago  Illinois and is a retired mechanical engineer by profession. He has a history of smoking  with an estimate of 30 pack-years. His family background is significant  as both his father and older brother had venous thrombosis. He is married with two children  and he lives with his wife  leading a sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting History:  Mr. X walked into the Emergency Department complaining of persistent sharp pain and swelling in his right calf muscle  which has been escalating over the past few days. The pain intensifies upon standing or walking. There have also been noted changes in the skin color around the painful area  tending towards a bluish-purplish hue. He reports episodes of breathlessness  primarily following physical exertion.  Past Medical History:  The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes 5 years ago  which he manages with prescribed medications. He additionally underwent a hernia surgery two years back. He has a history of occasional alcohol consumption  though moderate  and reports high consumption of red meat in his diet. He has not previously experienced or been diagnosed with any clotting disorders.  Pertinent Demographics and Epidemiology:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence typically peaks in those aged 60-70 and is slightly more common in male patients. Caucasians and those with a family history of thrombosis are at a higher risk. Notably  lifestyle factors such as smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and a diet rich in red meat have all been linked to higher DVT incidence.  This patient case presentation is a characteristic representation of typical high-risk demographic factors for DVT  underpinning the importance of managing modifiable risks and maintaining diligent surveillance in older patients with predisposing factors. Interventions should focus on lifestyle modification and effective disease management  alongside appropriate therapeutic measures.   References:  1. Heit JA  et al.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,1,100,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in an Elderly Caucasian Male  Introduction:   Today  I present a case study of Mr. Henry McDonald  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with signs and symptoms associated with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Demographics:  The patient was born and lives in Springfield  Illinois. He's married with 3 children and recently retired from his work as a truck driver. His primary language is English  and he completed a high school education.   Presenting symptoms:  Mr. McDonald reported swelling  pain  tenderness  and redness in the affected leg  more specifically in his left calf. He also stated that the discomfort worsened when he flexed his foot or stood up. He noticed these symptoms about a week ago  but he thought it was just muscle cramps due to his age.   Past Medical History:  Mr. McDonald was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia at the age of 62 and was put on antihypertensive and statin therapy. The patient also has a significant history of 35 years of smoking but quit 8 years ago. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a diet low in fruits and vegetables  favoring processed and fried foods.  In 2017  he underwent hip replacement surgery for which he was immobilized for an extended period. His family history shows a significant correlation  with his father experiencing a pulmonary embolism  and his grandfather suffering from recurrent DVTs.   His current medications include atenolol for his hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.   Inference:  The age of the patient  his personal medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  major surgery  immobilization  smoking history  and strong family history of DVT and embolism predispose him to high DVT susceptibility. Given his demographic and clinical presentation  early recognition and appropriate management of Mr. McDonald's case are necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,1,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Martinez is a 65-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 32)  hypertension  and a recent total knee replacement surgery one month ago. She presents to the emergency department complaining of progressive left leg pain and swelling for a week  which is not alleviated by rest or over-the-counter analgesics. She notes her leg appears to be a reddish-purple color  feels warm to touch and has become increasingly difficult to move due to discomfort.  The pain is a constant  dull ache  which is gradually getting more severe  rating it 7 out of 10 today compared to a 4 out of 10 a week ago. She denies any recent trauma  falls  or injury but admits to prolonged periods of immobility since her knee surgery. Further  she has no history of smoking  special dietary habits  or drugs  but states she was on an oral contraceptive pill a few years ago. She is currently on medication for her hypertension and post-surgical pain management.  There is no history of a similar episode in the past and denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  or syncope. She denies any recent travel. No known allergies. Family history is significant for a brother who suffered a stroke in his seventies.  This patient’s presentation  combined with her recent orthopedic surgery and significant immobility  raises concern for a potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,2,Patient Presentation:  Edward Roberts  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency room with complaints of pain  tenderness  warmth  and swelling in his left calf muscle that started 2 days ago. He describes the pain as dull aching and mentions that it amplifies when he stands or moves his left leg. He denies any trauma to the area.  Patient Demographics:  Edward is a retired mechanic who still manages a small garage from his home. He lives with his wife and pets in a rural town. He is a former smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history  having quit five years ago. His body mass index calculates to 29  which implies being overweight. He has a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement.  Past Medical History (PMH):  Edward was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago  for which he takes a daily regimen of Lisinopril. He also has Type II diabetes managed with Metformin. Last year  he underwent total knee arthroplasty of the left knee due to a longstanding history of osteoarthritis. Postoperatively  he was on prophylactic anticoagulation with Enoxaparin for a month.   Edward admits that he has not been moving or walking as much since his surgery. He admits that for the last few weeks he has mostly been sitting or lying down because of some ongoing personal stress and depression  which was diagnosed by his primary care physician a month ago. He also notes a recent long car trip which lasted for about 6 hours.  Family History (FH):   Edward's mother suffered from chronic venous insufficiency and his brother developed a deep vein thrombosis following a surgical procedure.  Given his PMH and current complaints  the physician is concerned about the potential for deep vein thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,3,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Johnson is a 62-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with his wife  complaining of increased redness  pain  and swelling in his left lower leg over the past 2-3 days. He describes the pain as a soreness and states it feels """"tight"""" and """"heavy."""" The pain is aggravated by standing and lessened somewhat when he elevates his leg.   Mr. Johnson is a retired truck driver and has a 50-pack year history of smoking  for which he quit about five years ago. His past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he is on medication. He also underwent a left knee replacement surgery about five years ago due to severe osteoarthritis. His family history is relevant for both parents having some form of cardiovascular disease.   Mr. Johnson denies any recent long-distance travel or period of immobility. However  he did recently have an outpatient procedure to remove a mole about two weeks ago. Despite discontinuing aspirin prior the procedure as advised  he reports non-adhering to clinician's advice to restart the medication afterwards.  Mr. Johnson came to the ER because his wife was worried as he seemed slightly out of breath from walking across the room though it may also be due to him being generally worried about the pain and swelling in his leg. "
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,4,A 65-year-old African-American female presents to the clinic complaining of unilateral leg pain in her left calf  which she notes has been persistent and worsening over the last three days. The pain is described as a constant  dull ache with occasional sharp twinges. She denies any recent trauma to the leg but mentions general fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient also reports mild swelling and erythema in the same area of discomfort.   She mentions a history of sedentarism due to her job as an administrative assistant. She takes no regular medications and has no known drug allergies. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  obesity (BMI: 35)  and a hormonal contraceptive use for the last five years. In addition  her mother had a history of pulmonary embolism.  On inspection  there is visible swelling  redness  and tenderness along the line of the left calf. The patient demonstrates pain on dorsiflexion of her left foot (Positive Homan's sign). Examination findings and symptoms indicate a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Genetic predisposition  elevated BMI  and contraceptive use raise additional concerns for DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,5,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Robert Mitchell  a 58-year-old African American man  presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressively worsening pain and swelling in his right calf. He also complained of tenderness in the same area. The pain was described as a constant aching sensation  rated at 6/10 on the visual analogue scale. Moreover  he reported a low-grade fever of 38.1°C (100°F) for the past day.  He denied any recent injury  travel  or surgical intervention but did admit to being sedentary due to his job as a truck driver. No other associated symptoms such as chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations were reported. There were no skin changes other than swelling. He mentioned the similar presentation happened three years ago  which was diagnosed as deep vein thrombosis after investigation.  He has a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and was an ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago). He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  and low-dose Aspirin. There is no history of known drug allergies. His family history is significant with both parents being diabetic and his father had a stroke at the age of 65. He does not consume alcohol and denies any illicit drug use.   On examination  there was noticeable swelling on the right leg compared to the left  warm to touch with visible veins. The area was tender to palpation and Homan’s sign was positive. His vital signs were stable aside from the slight fever. The rest of physical examination was unremarkable.   Considering his symptoms and past medical history  there is strong suspicion of a recurrent episode of deep vein thrombosis. The patient is likely to require a Doppler ultrasound exam to confirm the diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,6,Patient Presentation:   A 65-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with his wife  complaining of progressive pain and swelling on his left lower limb for the last 48 hours. The pain has increased significantly in intensity with any kind of movement. He also reported mild breathlessness for the last 5 hours.  Relevant History:   The patient is a retired school teacher who has remained largely sedentary since retirement 5 years ago. He has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension maintained under control with oral medications. He has a known history of recurrent DVT episodes after a bilateral knee replacement surgery 6 years ago and takes oral anticoagulants  but he admits inconsistent use due to forgetfulness. He also reports he recently traveled a long journey by car. The patient is a smoker and also consumes moderate amounts of alcohol.   Family History:   His father had a history of peripheral artery disease and his mother suffered from recurrent episodes of DVT. His older brother died from a pulmonary embolism following a hip replacement surgery.   Social History:  The patient lives with his wife and is currently retired  indulging in sedentary activities like reading and gardening. The patient's wife reports concern with his habit of sitting with his legs crossed for prolonged hours. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and consumes a moderate amount of alcohol  mainly in the form of red wine in the evening.

This presentation and relevant history point towards the possibility of deep vein thrombosis possibly due to prolonged periods of immobility associated with his sedentary lifestyle and long flights  possible inherited predisposition  and lifestyle risk factors such as obesity  and type 2 diabetes.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,57,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Brenda Thompson  a 65-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department complaining of an abrupt onset unilateral leg swelling  redness  and pain in her left calf that started 3 days ago. The pain is constant  described as throbbing  worsens on walking  and partially relieved by rest. She denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or lightheadedness.   Ms. Thompson has a medical background significant for stage-II hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years  well-controlled on metformin  lisinopril  and hydrochlorothiazide. She is also morbidly obese with a BMI of 35. She had a total knee replacement surgery six months ago. Her family history is significant for pulmonary embolism in her mother. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30 pack-year history but denies any alcohol or drug abuse.   Risk factors for DVT include obesity  recent surgery  lack of mobilization  long-term hypertension  and family history of clotting disorders. Given that the patient falls into these risk categories  a clinical assessment for deep vein thrombosis is warranted.

She also reports feeling mildly short of breath.  Past Medical History: 1. Known case of Hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  stable on medication 2. History of breast cancer  post lumpectomy and radiation therapy 3 years ago 3. Non-smoker but with history of cigarette smoking in the past (quit smoking 10 years ago)  Focused Family History: Mother had a history of stroke at the age of 68 years. Father had heart disease.  Drug History: 1. Metformin 500mg twice daily 2. Losartan 50mg once daily 3. Atenolol 25mg once daily  Allergies: No known drug allergies  On examination: Temperature: 98.6°F Pulse: 78 beats per minute (Regular) Blood pressure: 130/80 mmHg  Physical examination shows her left calf has local tenderness on palpation  increased warmth and it is swollen in comparison to the right calf. There were also signs of slight skin discoloration. Lungs were clear on auscultation  heart sounds were normal  and abdomen was soft and non-tender.  Summary: Mrs. Thompson is a retired 63-year-old Caucasian woman with history of hypertension  diabetes  and previous breast cancer  now presenting with pain and swelling in the left leg suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Given her medical history  she is at an increased risk of DVT and a thorough evaluation is required.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,61,Patient presentation:   Mr. Smith  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  employed as a long-haul truck driver  presents to the emergency department. The patient reports progressive swelling  pain  and warmth in the right leg over the past 3 days. He denies history of trauma  recent surgeries  or any history of venous disease.    His medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both controlled with medications. Mr. Smith has a 30-pack-year history of smoking and admits to a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation. Family history revealed his father had a Pulmonary Embolism after a long-distance flight at the age of 65.  On examination  there is noticeable swelling and apparent erythema on the right lég comparison to the left leg. His vitals are stable. His pulmonary exam  cardiovascular system  and abdominal exams are all within normal limits.  Notably  the patient recently completed a cross-country trip on his heavy goods vehicle  involving extended periods of time sitting and driving  with minimal opportunity for frequently leg movement or walking around. His occupation and lifestyle appear to contribute to prolonged immobility  thus increasing his risk for DVT.    A D-dimer test followed by a compression ultrasonography of the affected limb were ordered to confirm the suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Laboratory findings (blood glucose  lipid profile  renal function  liver function etc.) and proper management plan (e.g.  anticoagulants) will be established based on the results. The patient is advised of the need for immediate medical intervention  lifestyle modifications  and the serious implications if left untreated.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,62,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  John  retired coal miner and a known smoker for more than 40 years. He presents to the emergency room with complaints of a right calf pain and swelling for the past 2 days. The pain is described as a constant  aching tightness that is exacerbated by walking and is not relieved by rest.  He further reports an unexplained fatigue and mild shortness of breath on exertion over the last week. John denies any trauma to the leg  fever  chest pain  cough or any recent surgery. No significant past medical history  but family history includes father deceased due to myocardial infarction. His vitals are stable but exhibits elevated heart rate and reports he's feeling quite anxious due to the pain and discomfort.  On examination  the right calf is noticeably swollen and reddened compared to the left  with measureable difference in circumference. The area is tender to touch  warm  and pain significantly increases with dorsiflexion of foot  indicating positive Homans' sign. Respiratory and cardiac examination are unremarkable.   John lives with his wife  he enjoys working on his farm and going for fishing trips. He consumes alcohol occasionally. Despite multiple attempts to quit  he has been unsuccessful in giving up smoking. He admits that his activity level has decreased significantly over the last few months  due to gradual onset of generalized fatigue and breathlessness.  His blood tests and a subsequent Doppler ultrasound of his lower extremities have confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has been started on anticoagulation therapy and has been advised to elevate the leg and to use compression stockings. John and his family have been counselled on the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  increased physical activity and maintaining hydration.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,63,Patient Presentation: Mrs. Johnson  a 63-year-old African American woman with a past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and obesity  presents with a 3-day history of increasing pain and swelling in her left lower extremity. She works as a financial adviser and reports a sedentary lifestyle with prolonged periods of sitting.   She returned from a transatlantic flight a week ago and noticed a slight discomfort in her calf which she attributed to her extended period in a seated position during the flight. However  over the past few days the pain has grown steadily worse and is now associated with swelling  warmth  and a slightly bluish discoloration  prompting her to seek evaluation.  Mrs. Johnson denies chest pain  shortness of breath  recent surgeries  trauma or family history of clotting disorders. She is a non-smoker but takes oral contraceptives for menopausal symptoms. Her routine medications include metformin  lisinopril  and daily aspirin.   On examination  the left calf is observed to be swollen  red  and warmer when compared to the right calf. The leg circumference is significantly larger on the left compared to the right. The patient expresses tenderness when the calf is palpated. A preliminary physical examination suggests the possibility of a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old African American male employed as a long-distance truck driver  presenting today with a one-week history of increasing left leg discomfort  edema  and erythema. He reports the swelling began gradually but has progressively increased over the past two days and is accompanied by a dull aching pain.   He has a past medical history significant for obesity with BMI 32  type II diabetes managed with Metformin  and hypertension under control with Lisinopril. He has no history of surgeries or hospitalizations and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. Family history reveals his mother had a similar presentation in her 60s that was diagnosed as a deep vein thrombosis.  Mr. Johnson reports no chest pain  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis. However  he admits to prolonged periods of immobility due to his job as a truck driver during the COVID-19 pandemic which has seen him working longer hours. He denies any recent travels that involve long flights or car rides. He admits that he does not get to exercise as he should.   On physical examination  Mr. Johnson’s left leg is noticeably swollen with warm  erythematous skin. There's tenderness along the distribution of the left femoral vein. There are no signs of skin breakdown or ulceration. His vitals are stable with a blood pressure of 140/85mm Hg  a heart rate of 78 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and a body temperature of 98.4°F. The remainder of the exam  including cardiovascular and respiratory examinations  are essentially normal.   Considering his clinical presentation and risk factors (obesity  sedentary lifestyle due to occupation  age  and family history)  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) needs to be highly suspected. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,65,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Diane Thompson Age: 62 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Weight: 80 kg Height: 5'3"""" Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. Thompson presents with acute left leg pain and swelling that began suddenly 2 days ago. She describes the pain as constant  cramping  and rated it as a 7/10 on the pain scale. She also reports mild shortness of breath and light-headedness.

She had a hysterectomy 40 years ago due to endometriosis  and has had no surgeries since. Three months ago  she fractured her right wrist in a fall  leading to immobility and sedentary lifestyle. She also mentions a family history of blood clot disorders. Her cousin had a pulmonary embolism at a relatively young age.  Current Medications:  She is currently on Metformin for her diabetes  Losartan for hypertension  and a daily aspirin. She has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  She is a widow who lives alone but has a home care nurse who visits three times a week. She used to be a smoker but quit 15 years ago. She doesn't consume alcohol or illicit drugs.  Assessment:  Based on her age  family history of blood clot disorders  current symptoms  and sedentary conditions due to recent injury and lack of mobility  Mrs. Thompson fits into the classic demographic and risk profile for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). High index of suspicion for DVT is warranted and further diagnostic evaluation will be strategically beneficial."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,66,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Carla Vasquez is a 55-year-old Hispanic woman presenting to the ER with a complaint of severe right leg swelling  pain  and warmth that began abruptly two days ago. She also mentions that the affected leg appears reddish-blue. Symptoms worsen when she is standing or walking.   The patient has a known history of obesity  Type 2 diabetes mellitus which is partially controlled on Metformin and hypertension managed on Lisinopril. She does not smoke but reports a sedentary lifestyle  working as an accountant with prolonged hours of sitting. No history of surgical procedures in the last six months.   Ms. Vasquez had oral contraceptive use during her early forties. There is no family history of blood clotting disorders. After a recent long-haul (cross-country) flight  she didn't mobilize much during or after the flight.  This patient seems at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to her obesity  sedentary lifestyle  history of long-distance travel  age  female gender  and history of oral contraceptive use.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,67,Patient Presentation:  A 66-year-old Caucasian female presents to the clinic complaining of left lower leg pain for the past three days. The pain is constant  and she rates it as a 7 on a 10-point scale. She notes that the pain increases on standing and walking. She denies any recent trauma/injury to the leg  but reports a recent long-distance international flight lasting more than 6 hours. On examination  her left calf is swollen  warm and tender to touch  consistent with a potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT).    Past Medical History:  This patient has a history of type 2 diabetes for 15 years  controlled with metformin. She had an episode of pulmonary embolism 8 years ago  that was treated with anticoagulation therapy. She is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago after smoking one pack daily for 40 years. Additionally  she has been post-menopausal for 16 years and has been on hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes and night sweats. She reports no known drug allergies. She does not have a family history of blood clot disorders.   EI: Physical inactivity and immobility during her recent long-distance travel  her age  previous history of pulmonary embolism  her use of hormone replacement therapy  and her long history of smoking puts her at a heightened risk for DVT. Coupled with her presenting symptoms of a painful  swollen lower leg  this patient should be worked up for a DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,68,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 51-year-old African American woman who presents to the emergency department with complaints of a red  swollen  warm  and tender right calf that she first noticed two days ago. Her symptoms have gradually worsened  and she describes the pain as aching and constant.   She has a past medical history significant for obesity (BMI 35.2)  hypertension controlled with lisinopril  and a total knee replacement surgery on the same leg one month ago after a fall at home. She has been relatively sedentary  spending a significant proportion of time in bed post-surgery. Family history reveals her mother had a pulmonary embolism in her late fifties.  She’s a former smoker who quit approximately 10 years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally and doesn't use illegal drugs. She is also on birth control pills for menopausal symptom control.   On physical examination  she is in moderate distress due to pain  right lower extremity is erythematous and edematous  with a palpable 'cord-like' structure in the muscle. Her vital signs are stable  though her heart rate is slightly elevated. No other abnormalities are noted.   Considering her demographic details  past medical history  surgery  and current medication use that increases risks of clotting  she is likely presenting with deep vein thrombosis in her right lower extremity.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,69,Patient Presentation:  Sarah  a 72-year-old Caucasian woman  presents to the emergency department with a three-day history of increasing pain and swelling in her left leg. She has noticed that her left calf is significantly larger than her right and that it is red and warm to touch. She denies any history of trauma. However  she reports a dull ache in the affected leg  which is worse upon standing and walking short distances.  Sarah's past medical history is relevant and suggestive too. She has been living with hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years. She had a right hip replacement surgery a month ago following which she spent most of her time lying in bed. She has a 35 pack-year smoking history but quit a year ago. She has no known allergies.  She has been taking Metformin  Lisinopril  and aspirin daily with no changes in her normal regimen recently. She denies alcohol  illicit drug use. She lives with her daughter who aids her in daily activities and accompanies her to the doctor's appointments.  On physical examination  her left calf is tender to palpate  with noticeable edema and erythema. Her vital signs are stable: blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg  heart rate is 78 beats/min  respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min  and body temperature is 98.7 F. Oxygen saturation on room air is 96%.  The presentation suggests possible deep vein thrombosis  given her recent surgery  immobility  older age  and past medical history of diabetes and hypertension  which are risk factors. Further testing and management in this case would follow these suspicions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,70,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Laura Jones  a 55-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department with significant left leg pain  which she describes as a deep  persistent ache. She notes the pain began suddenly a couple of days ago. She also reports her left leg appears markedly swollen  slightly red and warm to touch for the same duration. She denies any injury to the area. Mrs. Jones also mentions experiencing mild shortness of breath over the past day  which she initially attributed to anxiety.  Mrs. Jones works as an accountant and describes her job as sedentary  where she sits for extended periods of time. She is married  does not smoke or drink alcohol  and has two adult children with no major health issues. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is in the overweight range at 29.  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus for which she is on medication. She recently underwent a total right hip replacement three weeks ago  which involved post-operative immobilization. She also has a family history of coagulation disorders - her mother had recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and her father passed away from a pulmonary embolism.   Compliance to her medication regimen is reported to be satisfactory  though she has not been dedicated to a regular physical activity routine for many years.  Summary:  Mrs. Jones' presentation is highly suggestive of DVT  which is more prevalent in older adults especially post-surgery. Her sedentary lifestyle and conditions such as obesity  hypertension  and diabetes further elevate the risk. Moreover  the presence of thrombotic disorders in the family significantly increases her predisposition towards clot formation. The sudden onset of breathlessness might indicate a complication of DVT  pulmonary embolism  which requires immediate attention. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,71,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old African American female presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of warmth  pain  redness  and swelling in her left leg extending from the calf to the middle of her thigh that began today. The pain appears to worsen with the bending of her foot. The patient also reports a recent three-day journey across the country in a car with long periods of stationary sitting. She denies any chest pains  shortness of breath  cough  or other symptoms.  The patient has a medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which she takes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin respectively. She also has a history of a previous Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the same leg ten years ago. She reports adherence to her medications and a smoking history of 20 pack-years. The patient is menopausal  has no surgical history  and her family history is pertinent for pulmonary embolism in her mother. Patient's BMI is 28 indicating overweight.  Given this patient’s history of sedentary travel  previous DVT  active smoking  and other risk factors including obesity  and a direct family member having had a pulmonary embolism  there's a high suspicion of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Further diagnostic testing is warranted for confirmation and subsequent anticoagulant treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,72,A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of unilateral swelling  redness  warmth  and aching pain in his left leg that started a few days ago. The patient reports no trauma or injury to the leg. He also reveals that he recently underwent a hip replacement surgery two weeks ago.

He denies any family history of blood clots or hereditary coagulation disorders. However  he had a hip replacement surgery 6 months ago after which he had limited mobility due to postsurgical pain.  On physical examination  his right calf is swollen  warm to touch  and tender compared to the left one. No visible veins or ulcers are noted. Pulses are palpable and symmetric in both legs  indicating good arterial flow.  Based on his risk factors of older age  obesity  recent major surgery  prolonged immobility  and presence of chronic diseases  a suspicion of deep vein thrombosis is made. A venous ultrasound of the lower extremities is ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,74,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of congestive heart failure and a recent hip surgery 3 weeks ago  presents to the emergency department with a progressively worsening pain and swelling in her left lower leg for the past couple of days. The patient also reports feeling increased warmth and redness over the same area. She denies any recent travel  family history of blood clots  or cancer. She admits to have been less active and more confined to her bed due to the hip surgery. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,75,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with complaints of unilateral leg swelling  warmth and pain that began 2 days ago. The pain is localized to the medial aspect of his left calf  rating it as an 8 on a scale of 10. The patient reported that he sits at his desk most of the day for work and recently engaged in a long 7-hour car drive without much movement  which exacerbated his condition.  The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been receiving treatment for these conditions for the past 5 years  including a daily regimen of Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and Atorvastatin 10mg respectively. The patient has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally  around three drinks a week.   On physical examination  his left calf appeared approximately 3 cms larger than the right. Homan's sign was positive on the left side. The patient's pulses were present and symmetrical. He was afebrile  and vitals were within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg.  The preliminary assessment and clinical presentation suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which was confirmed later by a Doppler ultrasound.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,76,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Maria Sanchez  a 58-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the clinic with ongoing complaints of unilateral swelling in her left leg  which she noticed around 4 days ago. It is associated with mild to moderate pain  particularly when standing or walking. She feels it's slightly warm to touch with a faint redness visible on her calf. Ms. Sanchez also reports episodes of chest discomfort and slight shortness of breath over the last 2 days.   She has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which she manages with metformin  and hypertension  controlled well with lisinopril. Maria admits that she has not been adhering strictly to her medication regimen and low-sodium diet over the last six months due to stress. She is also a former smoker  quit 20 years ago.   Her family history includes heart disease and stroke. Recently  about a month ago  she had a right total hip replacement surgery after a fall at home. Following the surgery  she was largely bedridden and did not follow up on her prescribed physical therapy.  In summary  her risk factors include recent surgery and subsequent prolonged immobility  long-term diabetes and hypertension  and previous smoking history. The patient provides consent for further necessary investigation to rule out the possibility of Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,77,"Patient Presentation  Mr. Wilson  a 67-year-old African American male with a recent history of orthopedic surgery following a left hip fracture  presents to the emergency department. He was on a prolonged bed rest for approximately 2 weeks after the surgery. He reports to experiencing left leg swelling for the past two days  accompanied by pain and redness. He describes the pain as constant  localized  and """"heavy""""  and rates it as 6/10 on the pain scale. The symptoms are worse with standing and slightly relieved by rest.   Alongside his recent surgery  Mr. Wilson has a past medical history of hypertension  obesity (BMI 30.7)  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  all under control with metformin  lisinopril  and diet modifications. He has been a smoker for the past 30 years.   There has been no reported recent travel  personal or family history of blood clotting disorders. On systemic review  he has moderate dyspnea which has newly developed. He denies chest pain  hemoptysis  or fever. Upon physical examination  his left leg is visibly swollen  and tender on deep palpation.   This patient presentation is fairly typical for DVT and further imaging should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This demographic representation aligns with literature  as DVT incidents tend to increase with age  are slightly more prevalent in males  and are associated with certain risk factors such as recent surgery  postoperative bed rest  obesity  smoking  and more. Furthermore  African American ethnicity has been found to have a slightly higher risk of developing DVT."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,2,78,A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department complaining of severe  constant pain in her right calf that has been progressively worsening over the past three days. She denies any trauma or injury but mentions a 13 hour flight she took from the UK to the USA six days ago. She also reports swelling and erythema in the same leg. Her body mass index (BMI) measures 31  classifying her as obese.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which she takes Lisinopril 20mg daily  and a hysterectomy performed 10 years ago due to heavy menstrual bleeding. Additionally  she had a fractured femur 5 years back.  Her family history reveals that her older sister was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism in her 50s. She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.  On physical examination  her right calf is observed to be swollen  erythematous  and distinctly warmer compared to her left calf. Respiration rate is slightly elevated  but other vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate are within normal range.  Given her recent long-haul flight  obesity  family history  and her clinical presentation  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is being considered. Further diagnostic testing was ordered  such as a D-Dimer test and a Doppler ultrasound of the leg  to confirm the diagnosis.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,2,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Demographics and Past Medical History in Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Slide Content: Briefly  let's delve into a case about how demographic factors and past medical history influence the occurrence of DVT.   Slide 2: Patient Information  Title: Patient Demographics  Slide Content: Our patient  Mr. X  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He's retired  living in a suburban area  smokes half a pack per day  and has a family history of blood clotting disorders. About 60-70% of DVT cases involve males over the age of 40 and smoking is an established risk factor.  Slide 3: Medical History Title: Past Medical History  Slide Content: Mr. X has a five-year history of hypertension and had a hip replacement surgery 2 months ago. He has been on antihypertensive medications and has a sedentary lifestyle. Previous surgeries  particularly orthopedic surgeries and hypertension  increase DVT risk.  Slide 4: Recent Complaint Title: Presenting Complaint  Slide Content: Mr. X has presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden swelling  pain  and warmth in his left lower leg  along with feelings of heaviness. Being knowledgeable about his risk factors  he was concerned about possible DVT.   Slide 5: Importance Title: Significance   Slide Content: DVT  although common  can lead to life-threatening complications  making it essential to recognize early and manage appropriately. Risk factors like advanced age  surgery  smoking  and personal or family history of clotting disorders disproportionately increase the risk.  Slide 6: About DVT Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide Content: DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein  usually in the lower leg  thigh  or pelvis. Prompt diagnostic interventions like ultrasound or D-dimer test are crucial to confirm DVT and initiate appropriate anticoagulation therapy.  Slide 7: Conclusion Title: Take Home Message  Slide Content: Understanding demographics and past medical history can not only aid in quick diagnosis but also help in targeted prophylactic measures. By proactively assessing risk and implementing preventive strategies  we can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,3,Title: A Complex Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis Involving Multimorbidity and Coagulation Disorders  Slide 1: Introduction - Our case under study pertains to Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  a blood clot in one or more deep veins  typically in the legs. DVT affects an estimated 300 000 to 600 000 individuals in the United States each year.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics & Case Presentation - The patient  Mr. James Schmidt  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. Caucasians have been shown in recent studies to present a slightly higher risk for DVT. Recent data indicates that about 1 to 2 per 1 000 people in the U.S. will develop DVT annually  and this risk increases with age. - Mr. Schmidt is a former smoker and suffers from Obesity (BMI: 32)  which increases the likelihood of DVT.  Slide 3: Clinically Relevant Medical History - Mr. Schmidt was previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes (10 years ago) and hypertension (7 years ago). He has been managing these conditions with medication and lifestyle changes but has had occasional periods of non-compliance.  - He has a history indicative of coagulation disorders  with a previous incident of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) diagnosed 5 years ago.  Slide 4: Onset & Progression of the Current Condition  - Mr. Schmidt presented with a swollen  red  and painful left leg. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep veins of his leg  diagnosing DVT.  - Risk of recurrent DVT or PE is generally higher for patients with a past episode of VTE  like in Mr. Schmidt's case.  Slide 5: Current Risks & Prognosis  - Mr. Schmidt's multimorbid state (Type II Diabetes  Obesity  and Hypertension) and prior history of PE pose significant risk of complications such as recurrent DVT  PE  or post-thrombotic syndrome. - His non-compliance with medication regimes is an additional risk factor for repeated episodes of DVT.    Slide 6: Treatment Approach  - Following standard therapeutic interventions  he was started on anticoagulation therapy with regular monitoring of renal function and clotting parameters. - Weight management  consistent management of diabetes and hypertension  and advice on smoking cessation were presented as critical components of his overall treatment plan.    Slide 7: Conclusion - Mr. Schmidt’s case underscores the necessity of vigilant monitoring of patients with a history of coagulation disorders and multimorbidity  along with adherence to prescribed treatment regimens to better manage DVT and prevent its recurrence or escalation into a more serious pulmonary embolism.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,8,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Good day  everyone. Today  we'll engage in an in-depth case analysis of a condition known as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot that forms within a deep vein in the body  predominantly in the leg.  Slide 2: Patient's Background We present a case of Mr. James  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  a retired teacher living in Minnesota. He has been relatively active and healthy until recently.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. James has a history of hypertension  for which he takes a beta-blocker. He also suffers from obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31. He recently underwent a total hip replacement surgery and has been less mobile than usual. He is a former smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Slide 4: Present Complaint  Mr. James presented with unexplained swelling  pain  and warmth in his right leg  symptoms which have been ongoing for the past three days. The symptoms seemed to worsen when he stood or walked.  Slide 5: DVT Attribution and Risk Factors  The manifestation of DVT is often linked to risk factors such as recent surgery  physical inactivity  and hypertension. In Mr. James' case  his age  obesity  recent hip surgery  limited mobility  and hypertension could have contributed to his condition.  Slide 6: Incidences of DVT  DVT is relatively common in the population  with around 1-2 per 1 000 people affected annually. The incidence increases with age. Furthermore  major surgery  such as hip or knee replacement  increases the risk of DVT.  Slide 7: Diagnosis Mr. James was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis following physical examination  the D-dimer test  and confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography.  Slide 8: Treatment  Treatment involved the administration of anticoagulants  to reduce the ability of the blood to clot  preventing the existing clot from growing. Compression stockings were also advised to reduce swelling.  Slide 9: Prevention and Prognosis  Strategies to prevent DVT postoperatively include early mobilization  use of blood thinners  and compression devices. Prognosis is generally good with proper treatment and precautionary measures.  Slide 10: Conclusion   DVT is a significant health concern  primarily due to potential complications such as pulmonary embolism. Surveillance for symptoms in patients with risk factors and early intervention is vital to prevent severe consequences.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,12,Title: Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition where a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins present in the body  usually in legs. DVT can occur without noticeable symptoms but it may lead to the life-threatening complication of pulmonary embolism.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  retired blue-collar worker with BMI falling under the overweight category. The demographic is consistent with literature  showing higher prevalence of DVT among older adults  particularly males  Caucasians and those with sedentary lifestyles or with obesity.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history of minor surgeries  occasional bouts of unexplained chest discomfort  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. There is no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. The patient’s mother had a history of embolism. Importantly  the patient took a long-haul flight about 10 days prior to the admission  recognized as one of the risk factors for DVT - so-called 'economy class syndrome'.  Slide 4: Symptom Presentation The patient presented with intermittent pain  warmth  redness and swelling in his left calf that had gradually worsened over the past week. On examination  visible superficial veins were noticeable. There were no indications of symptoms related to pulmonary embolism such as shortness of breath  chest pain  or unexplained cough.  Slide 5: Investigations & Diagnosis  D-dimer test  along with a venous ultrasound  determined the presence of DVT. The diagnosis was confirmed with the findings of a hypercoagulable panel  further indicating a genetic predisposition towards clotting disorders.  Slide 6: Treatment & Management The patient was given an intravenous Heparin short-term  then switched to Warfarin  ensuring an overlap of 5 days. Lifestyle changes recommended included increased physical activity when possible  leg elevation to help reduce swelling  and compression garments prescribed for everyday use.  Slide 7: Conclusion DVT is a complex condition requiring quick identification and effective management. Given the patient's age  medical history  and recent travel  a high suspicion for DVT allowed a prompt diagnosis  the initiation of appropriate therapy and an increased chance of a positive outcome. Prevention  early detection  and public education remain paramount in handling DVT cases.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,25,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Patient's Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) represents a serious health concern  with an annual incidence of approximately 1 in 1000 adults. It is commonly associated with several risk factors such as age  surgery  cancer  immobilization and genetic predisposition. This presentation reviews a case study of a patient with DVT.  Slide 2: Demographics  Our patient  Mr. Jones  is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. According to the literature  DVT is slightly more common in male patients  especially in older age groups. The incidence of DVT increases substantially after the age of 40 and continues to rise throughout life. It is important to consider these demographic factors when evaluating a patient's risk for DVT.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Jones has a significant medical history including obesity  recent hip replacement surgery  and a family history of DVT. All these factors contribute to his elevated risk of developing DVT. Obesity is linked to a twofold risk for DVT and joint replacement surgery increases the risk as patients are often immobile post-surgery. Additionally  genetics can play a role in DVT  as having a first-degree relative with the condition increases risk by nearly 60%.  Slide 4: Patient Presentation and Diagnosis  Mr. Jones presented with a swollen  warm  and painful leg  specifically in the calf area. He reported tenderness under his knee that worsened with bending his foot. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a blood clot in his deep veins  leading to his diagnosis of DVT.  Slide 5: Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors  including demographic and past medical histories  in assessing the risk for DVT. Recognizing these attributes helped in the timely diagnosis for Mr. Jones  promoting better management and prognosis of his condition. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,26,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition that involves the formation of a clot (thrombus) in the deep veins  typically in the legs.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,46,**Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis**  I. Introduction Today we will discuss a case of a patient diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which is a blood clot in a deep vein  usually in the leg.  II. Patient Demographics Our patient is a 62-year-old African-American female  a notable demographic as studies suggest that African-American individuals have a significantly higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (which includes DVT) than Caucasian individuals.   III. Past Medical History The patient has a history of obesity  hormonally influenced conditions (polycystic ovary syndrome)  and has been on hormone replacement therapy during menopause. She also has a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. These are all highlighted as they are well documented risk factors for DVT.   IV. Current Medical Issues Currently  the patient presents with symptoms of swelling  warm feeling  red or discolored skin  and leg pain or tenderness on one side of the body. These symptoms are indicative of DVT and warrant further investigation.  V. Diagnosis The patient has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) using both clinical presentation and confirmatory Ultrasound Doppler studies.   VI. Treatment  She has been prescribed anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin and a transition to long-term anticoagulants. Her treatment also includes measures to enhance mobility  use of compression stockings  and a weight-loss program to mitigate obesity and promote overall health.  VII. Prevention To prevent further instances of DVT  the patient has been advised to break up long periods of immobility  maintain a healthy weight  and to consider possible discontinuation of hormone therapy under medical guidance.  With this case  we understand the importance of noting risk factors- in particular obesity  hormonal influences  and immobility- in the diagnosis and management of DVT. This case underscores the prevalence of DVT in African-American population and is a call to increased awareness for earlier diagnosis and effective treatment.  VIII- Conclusion By proper treatment and modification of behavior  the prognosis for our patient is quite hopeful for a life with reduced risk of recurrence of DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,51,Presentation Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a significant medical condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein  predominantly in the lower limbs. It poses severe risks due to the potential of pulmonary embolism. It affects up to 1 in 1000 adults annually  with a lifetime incidence of approximately 2-5%.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case study revolves around a 65-year-old Caucasian male  representing the demographic most affected by DVT. Aging significantly increases the risk of DVT.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of long periods of immobility due to his working environment as a long-haul truck driver. He also reported occasional smoking and obesity. His BMI is 31  which is categorized as obese.  Slide 4: Relevant History  No prior personal or family history of thrombotic events. The patient has hypertension  managed by daily medication.  Slide 5: Current Symptoms  Presented with unilateral leg swelling  redness  and a low-grade fever. He reported pain in the calves while walking and an overall feeling of unwellness.  Slide 6: Clinical Findings  Physical examination revealed a warm skin over the affected leg  tender on palpation with palpable cords in the popliteal vein. Homans' sign was positive.  Slide 7: Diagnosis  Ultrasound Doppler Study confirmed the diagnosis of DVT  revealing a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. D-Dimer Test was elevated.  Slide 8: Management  The patient was immediately started on Anticoagulant therapy – low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  followed by long-term warfarin treatment. A lifestyle modification plan aimed at weight reduction  smoking cessation  and mild regular exercise were advised.   Slide 9: Follow Up and Prognosis  Patients with DVT need constant monitoring to avoid potential complications and prevent recurrence. Anticoagulation therapy carries a risk of bleeding; hence routine blood coagulation tests are advised. The prognosis of DVT  if managed properly  is good.  Slide 10: Key Takeaways  DVT may occur with no apparent symptoms and has the potential for severe complications. Thus  it's crucial to maintain a high degree of suspicion in patients with risk factors and seemingly unrelated symptoms. Early detection and prompt treatment are vital.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,56,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot in one or more of the deep veins  usually in the legs. DVT can have serious health implications if left untreated  as it may lead to a potentially life-threatening complication known as a pulmonary embolism.  Slide 2: Demographics Demographic data suggests that DVT affects about 1 in every 1 000 individuals in the United States annually  with the incidence increasing with age. Although DVT can affect both genders  males are seemingly at a slightly higher risk. Notably  the incidence of DVT among African-Americans is higher (153 per 100 000) compared to Caucasians (103 per 100 000) and Hispanics (76 per 100 000).  Slide 3: Case Presentation The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male  presenting with pain and swelling in his right calf. He reports the pain is at its worst when he stands or walks. His medical history reveals a sedentary lifestyle and recent hospitalization for hip replacement surgery three weeks ago. He also reports a recent long-haul flight.   Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has a significant medical history  including type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension  all of which are well-managed with prescription medications. There is no history of smoking or alcoholism  but he admits to a diet high in saturated fats and a lack of physical activity. Family history reveals a sister who had DVT.   Slide 5: Risk Factors in the Presented Case a) Age: Risk of DVT increases with age; our patient is 65 years old. b) Recent surgery with immobility: Hip replacement surgeries can increase the risk due to inactivity during recovery. c) Long plane travel: Prolonged immobility  such as during long-haul flights  can precipitate DVT. d) Ethnicity: Higher risk in African-Americans. e) Family History: Sister had DVT  implies potential genetic risk. f) Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle coupled with a diet high in saturated fats.  Slide 6: Next Steps and Conclusion Considering this patient's symptoms  demographics  and medical history  it's crucial to further investigate the possibility of DVT. Prompt diagnosis with doppler ultrasound and appropriate anticoagulation treatment can significantly reduce the risk of complications such as pulmonary embolism.   This case underscores the importance of considering patient demographics & risk factors when evaluating potential DVT and formulating a comprehensive management plan.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,65,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  I. Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a grave medical condition distinguished by the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins  typically in the leg or pelvis region. It often features complications like pulmonary embolism (PE) increasing the morbidity and mortality rates every year. Here  we present a case study that reflects the overall demographic distribution of DVT  based on available medical literature.  II. Patient Demographics:  - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired - Residence: Urban area - Lifestyle: Sedentary  (Note: The demographic details of the patient are chosen reflecting the real-world representation. DVT is more common among the elderly  with peak incidence in those over the age of 60. Furthermore  the risk of DVT is slightly higher in females. Caucasian ethnicity has a higher predisposition towards DVT compared to other ethnic groups.)  III. Past Medical History:  - History of prolonged immobilization due to hip surgery - History of estrogen therapy for managing post-menopausal symptoms - Non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption - No known allergies - Family history of clotting disorders - Had been diagnosed with obesity with a BMI of 32  (Note: Risk factors popularly associated with DVT include surgery  prolonged immobilization  estrogen therapy  obesity  advanced age  and family history of clotting disorders.)  IV. Clinical Presentation:  The patient visited an outpatient clinic with complaints of unilateral leg pain and noticeable swelling. She reported the discomfort to be worsening over the past 2-3 days. The leg was also warm to touch with mild erythema. Furthermore  she showed signs of mild dyspnea but without chest pain.  V. Diagnosis and Management:  Venous plethysmography and Doppler flow ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of DVT  a common tool for DVT diagnosis. A venogram further showed an occlusive blood clot in the left femoral vein. The patient was immediately put on anticoagulant therapy as per standard guidelines for initiation of DVT treatment. Lifestyle modification advice was also issued to manage her obesity and in turn  reduce the likelihood of DVT recurrence.  -------------------- By presenting this case study  we aim to increase awareness  stimulate a more advanced diagnostic approach  and promote the implementation of preventive measures in patients with key risk factors for DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,66,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with the concern of a swollen  painful leg  indicative of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). This aligns with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline which identifies age over 60  and male gender as significant demographic risk factors for DVT.  Slide 2: Demographics & Past Medical History   Patient X is retired  lives alone  and has a history of heavy smoking. He has past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. There is no family history of clotting disorders. His sedentary lifestyle and obesity (BMI: 31) further contribute to DVT risk.   Slide 3: Recent History   Three weeks ago  Patient X underwent a total hip replacement surgery which significantly increases the risk of developing DVT due to mobility  particularly within the first six weeks post-surgery.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation   Upon physical examination  left lower leg is swollen  warm and red. Patient reports increased pain in the leg with passive dorsiflexion of the foot (positive Homan's sign).   Slide 5: Differential Diagnosis   Based on his clinical presentation  patient history  and recent surgery  Deep Vein Thrombosis is a primary differential diagnosis. However  cellulitis and a ruptured Baker's cyst should also be considered.  Slide 6: Investigations   To confirm diagnosis  a D-dimer test is performed  showing elevated levels. Followed up with Duplex Ultrasound which reveals thrombus in the left popliteal vein.  Slide 7: Diagnosis & Management   Research consistently shows that early and appropriate administration of anticoagulant therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in DVT patients. Hence  Patient X is prescribed a low molecular weight heparin  Enoxaparin.   Educating the patient about the importance of regular movement  improving his diet to manage his cholesterol levels  giving up smoking and managing hypertension is crucial to prevent recurrence and improve overall health.  Slide 8: Conclusion   DVT is a life-threatening condition that requires a swift response to prevent complications such as Pulmonary Embolism. This case emphasises the importance of acknowledging risk factors  understanding clinical presentations  differential diagnoses  prompt investigations  and adhering to evidence-based management strategies.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,68,Title: Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis In a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female  Slide 1: Introduction  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within the deep veins typically in the legs  which can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. In this presentation  we will focus on a case study involving a 42-year-old Caucasian female patient diagnosed with DVT.  Slide 2: Demographics  Multiple sources including the veinsite.com affirm that DVT is relatively common  affecting approximately 600 000 people in the United States each year. DVT is more prevalent among older adults but can occur at any age. While it affects people of all races  it's slightly more common in the Caucasian population.  Slide 3: Patient Background  The patient is a 42-year-old Caucasian female  a secretary by profession which requires her to sit for extended periods. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is overweight and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Her medical history includes three uncomplicated pregnancies (the last one 5 years ago)  consistent use of oral contraceptives for birth control  and a family history of clotting disorders. The patient has no history of surgeries or hospitalizations and isn't currently on any long-term medication.  Slide 5: Onset of Symptoms   The patient complained of the abrupt onset of unilateral leg swelling and pain that developed over three days. She also reported a minor redness and warmth around the swollen area of her left calf.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Suspicion of DVT was established based on her symptoms  risk profile  and the presence of significant risk factors. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a clot in the left lower limb.  Slide 7: Discussion  This case aligns with current literature  indicating that risk factors for DVT include prolonged immobility  obesity  oral contraceptive use  and a positive family history. As a patient exhibits these risk factors  clinicians should have a heightened suspicion for the development of DVT  leading to swift diagnosis and management.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,80,Title: Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Slide 1: Introduction The purpose of this presentation is to highlight a case of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  a medical condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body  generally in the legs. The National Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Aged ≥65 Study reported that patients aged 65 years and older made up 60% of all DVT cases.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mrs. A  is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman with a sedentary lifestyle. Demographically  the risk of DVT increases with age. It is especially prevalent among women on hormonal therapy and overweight individuals - both of which apply to Mrs. A. She lives alone and is a retired teacher.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. A is a known type 2 diabetic and was diagnosed with hypertension fifteen years ago. She is also obese with a BMI of 31. She has been on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) for her post-menopausal symptoms for the past five years. No history of any hereditary blood clotting disorders.  Slide 4: Current Medical Issues Mrs. A came to the clinic complaining of a swollen  red  and achy left leg. She has been experiencing a mild fever since yesterday. Studies indicate that a swollen leg  especially in elderly patients  is often a key indicator of DVT.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Confirmation Based on her symptoms  an initial diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was made. The diagnosis was later confirmed after performing a Doppler ultrasound. Blood tests were also conducted to measure D-Dimer levels  which are often high in patients with blood clots.  Slide 6: Treatment Mrs. A was started on anticoagulants  the standard treatment for DVT  which serve to prevent the clot from getting larger. She was also counselled on the importance of regular leg exercises to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome and the necessity of wearing graduated compression stockings. Modifications were made to her current HRT considering its role in promoting blood clots.   Slide 7: Follow Up and Prognosis  Regular follow ups are scheduled to monitor the size of the blood clot and Mrs. A's response to treatment. Patient education about the importance of medication compliance  lifestyle modifications and weight management will be of major focus in her line of management.  Slide 8: Conclusion  In conclusion  the case of Mrs. A exemplifies the typical presentation  risk factors  diagnosis  and management of Deep Vein Thrombosis. As healthcare professionals  our role extends beyond treatment to educating such high-risk groups about the risk and prevention of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,81,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) refers to the formation of a blood clot in the deep vein system  predominantly of the lower extremities.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics The subject is Mr. X  a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He hails from a middle-income bracket  spent most of his career as a truck driver  and is a resident of Nebraska  USA. The choice of the patient reflects the incidence of DVT  which is more common in adults over 60 and demonstrates a slight prevalence in the white population.  Slide 3: Patient’s Past Medical History  Mr. X has a history of Type 2 Diabetes  which he manages with oral antidiabetic medication. He battled obesity in his early 50s but steadily brought his weight to a healthier range. He also has a 20-year history of smoking  though he quit five years ago.  Slide 4: Risk Factors  Contributing to his risk for DVT are his prior sedentary job  advanced age  history of smoking  obesity  and diabetes. These are known risk factors of DVT as his job involved long periods of leg inactivity  and diabetic patients are prone to circulatory issues.  Slide 5: Symptomology  Diagnosis  and Treatment Mr. X presented with increasing leg pain  swelling  and a feeling of warmth in the affected area. His DVT was diagnosed through an ultrasound. He now requires immediate anticoagulant therapy and has been recommended lifestyle changes  including regular walking and maintaining a balanced diet to manage his overall health and prevent the recurrence of DVT.  Slide 6: Conclusion As this case demonstrates  DVT can be present in individuals with certain risk factors. Understanding these risks and ensuring proper management can help reduce the chances of DVT occurrence or recurrence and prevent potential complications  such as pulmonary embolism.

Mr. Smith is retired  moderately active  and lives with his wife in suburbia.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both diagnosed 15 years ago. He is a non-smoker but used to smoke in his early twenties until he reached 45. He underwent a hip replacement surgery eight months ago and he was placed on bed rest for a substantial period post-surgery.   Slide 4: Relevant Medical History The hip replacement surgery and the prolonged bed rest created a conducive environment for thrombus formation. His previous history of smoking may have caused lingering circulatory problems  contributing to elevated risk. His hypertension and hypercholesterolemia might have accelerated the thrombotic process as a result of damage induced to endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.  Slide 5: Presentation  Mr. Smith came to the hospital complaining of progressive pain and swelling in his left lower leg for the past three days. The pain worsens when he tries to walk. He also mentions occasional shortness of breath.  Slide 6: Physical Examination & Diagnosis On examination  his left lower leg appears reddish and warm compared to the right leg. The symptoms coupled with his medical history suggest the probability of DVT. An ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 7: Treatment & Prevention Mr. Smith is given anticoagulant medications such as warfarin and enoxaparin. Alongside  measures like use of compression stockings and physical activity are recommended to promote blood circulation. To lower the risk of recurrence  regular follow-ups will be provided and the patient is advised to manage his hypertension and hypercholesterolemia effectively.  Conclusion: Understanding patient characteristics and past medical history is fundamental to diagnosing and managing conditions like DVT. In this case  Mr. Smith’s age  surgery  and extended bed rest were major contributors to his DVT  highlighting the importance of vigilance following major therapeutic procedures and strict management of chronic conditions.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,88,Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction: This presentation offers a clinical case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a blood clot condition that primarily affects the large veins of the lower extremities. The primary aim is to understand the onset  predisposing factors  diagnosis  and management strategies related to DVT.   Case Profile:  I. Patient Demographics  - Gender: Female  - Age: 60 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Office Employee  II. Past Medical History  The patient's medical history includes: - A sedentary lifestyle due to her desk job leading to obesity (BMI 30.5) - Chronic hypertension  controlled with medication - History of smoking for 35 years with multiple unsuccessful quit attempts  - No known allergic history - No prior surgeries  III. Reason for Consultation Presenting with symptoms of localized pain  swelling  redness  accompanied by warmth in the lower right leg  persistent over the past 3 days.  Additional Details:  According to literature  the incidence of DVT is higher among older adults  especially those with one or more risk factors  as seen in our patient (obesity  hypertension  smoking  sedentary lifestyle). This demographic model accurately represents a common DVT profile in Western societies  where Caucasians have a higher incidence rate.  The physical examination showed an edematous  erythematous lower right leg. No palpable cord seen. The patient’s vital signs were within normal limits except for mild hypertension. These findings along the length of the deep veins raised a high suspicion for deep vein thrombosis.  The patient underwent a D-dimer test  which was high  and an ultrasound scan of the right leg  which confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombosis in the right femoral vein.  The case study intends not just to inspect the diagnostic journey of patients with DVT  but also to stress the importance of preventative measures and bring about a comprehensive understanding of the management and treatment of DVT. These factors make the case particularly significant from a public health standpoint. Thank you for your attention.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,89,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Slide 1: Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition that involves the formation of a clot within a deep vein  typically in the leg. Today  we will explore a case study involving a patient with this condition.  Slide 2: Patient’s Demographics The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  an office worker who leads a sedentary lifestyle. Data show that age  being a male  and sedentary behavior are significant risk factors for DVT. Caucasian ethnicity is over-represented in the literature  especially males in their middle age.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Past medical history reveals that the patient is overweight with a BMI of 29  and has a habit of smoking. He was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago and has been on medication since. Additionally  he suffered a minor injury to his left leg two months prior  which was treated with an immobilization cast.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient presented with swelling in the left calf and a sensation of heaviness. There was mild to moderate pain which got worse when standing or walking. Red or discolored skin on the leg and a feeling of warmth in the affected area were other prominent signs noticed.  Slide 5: Diagnosis The symptoms led us to suspect DVT. An ultrasound scanning confirmed the presence of a blood clot in the deep veins of the lower left leg. Further tests such as D-dimer and MRI were also conducted to evaluate the severity of the problem.  Slide 6: Risk Factors and Management Our patient's age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking  and history of immobilization due to injury increase his risk of DVT. We recommended lifestyle changes such as improved diet  increasing physical activity  cessation of smoking  and weight management. Medication included anticoagulants to prevent the clot from getting bigger.  Slide 7: Prognosis With the right treatment and lifestyle modifications  outlook for this patient is positive. However  he is at risk of developing Post-Thrombotic Syndrome and recurrent DVT  so regular follow-ups are necessary.  Slide 8: Conclusion The demographic factors and past medical history played a crucial role in the patient's DVT. By understanding these factors and applying effective treatment and management strategies  we can help reduce the risk and impact of DVT in similar cases.   [End of Presentation]

Slide 5: Current Presentation  - The patient presents with unilateral swelling  pain  warmth  and redness over his left lower leg for one week. - Lower extremity duplex ultrasound shows DVT in the left posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  Slide 6: Conclusion  - High suspicion for DVT in patients with associated risk factors can promote early diagnosis and management to prevent sequela  such as pulmonary embolism. - Given the patient's demographics and medical history  his risk factors were significant for the development of DVT.   The case provides a suitable learning opportunity to understand the role of comorbidities and lifestyle factors in the occurrence of Deep Vein Thrombosis. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,91,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis Case Presentation   Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Patient is a 50-year-old African American male  named Mr. J  from a low socioeconomic background. African Americans have been observed to have higher incidences of DVT compared to Caucasians (Zakai et al.  2014). The patient works as a truck driver which requires long hours of sitting  a potential risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 2: Presenting Complaint  Mr. J presents with pain  swelling  warmth  and tenderness in his left lower leg  which has persisted for several days. There is a notable color change  with the skin appearing red. The symptoms are classic signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   His past medical history reveals a sedentary lifestyle  with a BMI of 31 indicating obesity  a significant risk factor for DVT. He is a former smoker with a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol  but is not currently on any medications. He has no history of surgeries or injuries. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Slide 4: Clinical Findings and Diagnosis  Given the patient’s signs and symptoms  and the risk factors involved  a Doppler ultrasound is obtained  revealing a clot in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 5: Treatment Plan   Mr. J was started on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin for long-term therapy. He was advised to elevate his leg and apply a warm compress to the affected area to reduce swelling and pain.   Slide 6: Prognosis and Follow-up  Mr. J will require ongoing anticoagulation monitoring and lifestyle modifications including a low-sodium diet  increasing physical activity  and wearing compression stockings to prevent the recurrence of DVT. He will follow up in the outpatient clinic in 1 week to ensure therapeutic levels of anticoagulation and symptom control.  Slide 7: Conclusion - Preventive Measures  Emphasize the importance of early detection  lifestyle changes to maintain a healthy weight and regular exercise  cessation of smoking  and good control of underlying conditions such as hypertension and high cholesterol. Mr. J's occupation makes him more prone to DVT  suggesting a need for occupational changes to prevent further events  including taking regular breaks to walk around and avoid prolonged sitting.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,95,Title: Case Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Introduction Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a severe condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein  typically in the leg. It poses a significant risk for pulmonary embolism  a potentially life-threatening complication.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics and Past Medical History Our patient is Ms. Carla  a 65-year-old Caucasian female (consistent with the literature verifying DVT often affects older adults  particularly after the age of 60). She is a retired office administrator and leads a sedentary lifestyle.   Slide 3: Previous Health Concerns Carla has a past medical history significant for: - Hypertension  controlled with medication  - Obesity with a BMI of 32  - Mild type-2 Diabetes  and - History of smoking (quit 5 years ago). These factors put her at a higher risk of DVT due to increased clotting possibility  slower blood flow  and blood vessel damage.  Slide 4: Recent Surgical History Carla underwent a total hip replacement surgery six weeks ago  after which she spent most of her time bedridden during the recovery phase. The prolonged immobility following orthopedic surgery is a recognized risk factor for DVT.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation Currently  she came in complaining of progressive  unilateral swelling  and pain in her right lower leg  which has been progressively getting worse over the past week.  Slide 6: Physical Examination The physical examination revealed a warm  swollen  and tender right calf.  Slide 7: Diagnostic Testing Due to her history and clinical presentation  a Doppler ultrasound was performed to check for blood flow abnormalities in the deep veins of her leg  confirming a diagnosis of DVT.  Slide 8: Conclusion and Discussion  This case underlines the importance of considering DVT in the differential diagnosis for patients with similar demographic and risk factors presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling  especially following orthopedic surgical procedures.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,96,Title: A Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Introduction  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — a condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins  usually in the lower extremities  has an annual incidence of approximately 1 per 1 000 adults in the United States. Risk factors include age  obesity  immobility  surgery  pregnancy  and the presence of cancer.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case involves a Hispanic female patient  aged 68. She is retired and lives in a suburban area. Hispanic population has an intermediate risk of VTE  including DVT  compared to higher risk populations like African Americans and lower risk Caucasian or Asian populations.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history of obesity (BMI of 31)  hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. She is happily married and a mother of three children. She stopped smoking when she was diagnosed with diabetes 15 years ago. She is physically inactive  mainly due to arthritic knee pain.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms She presented with pain and swelling in the right lower extremity  which started gradually and worsened through the day. She also mentioned a feeling of warmth over the swollen region. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or recent travel.  Slide 5: Investigations & Diagnosis Physical exam revealed right leg edema and tenderness. D-dimer testing was found to be positive following which an ultrasound of the right leg confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the Deep Femoral Vein  confirming the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis.  Slide 6: Treatment & Follow up Patient was administered anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  followed by a transition to oral anticoagulants. She was also advised to wear compression stockings to reduce swelling and encouraged to move as much as possible.  Slide 7: Community & Preventive Perspective This case underscores the importance of managing risk factors such as obesity and immobility in order to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis  particularly in older adults.   Slide 8: Conclusion  Such cases re-emphasize the need for medical practitioners to be vigilant and consider DVT in differential diagnosis  especially in patients presenting with unexplained leg swelling and who have other accompanying risk factors.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,97,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in The Elderly Population: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction  We highlight a case of Deep Vein Thrombosis  a condition that has a high prevalence within the older adult population  often associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired and spent the majority of his career in a sedentary office job. This demographics is quite reflective of the typical demographic profiles suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which commonly affects the older adults  and is more prevalent among Caucasians and those living a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Doe's past medical history is significant for hypertension  diabetes type II  and a former smoker with a 40-pack/year history  which presents a remarkable risk for DVT. He had a knee replacement surgery about two years ago  which is another contributing factor for DVT.  Slide 4: Current Complaints  Mr. Doe has presented with swelling  pain  and warmth over the left lower extremity for the past four days  symptoms highly suggestive of DVT.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Overview Due to the clinical scenario and high probability of DVT (based on Wells criteria)  an ultrasound with Doppler was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of left lower extremity DVT.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan  Mr. Doe was started on anticoagulation therapy using low molecular weight Heparin  followed by the transition to long-term therapy with Warfarin with regular INR checks. He was educated about the signs of bleeding and was advised to have regular follow-ups.  Slide 7: Preventive Measures and Prognosis The prevention of recurrent DVT episodes hinges on controlling the risk factors - such as encouraging physical activity and managing his comorbidities effectively. Prognosis was discussed with Mr. Doe to prepare him for potential complications and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case of Mr. Doe illuminates the classic presentation of DVT  often seen in older adults with multiple risk factors.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,99,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in Elderly Female Populations  Slide 1: Introduction  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) represents a serious medical issue with significant ramifications  including life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). While DVT can affect any age group  it is particularly prevalent among the elderly  and more common in women post menopause  due to diminished levels of protective estrogens.   Slide 2: Case Presentation  Patient Profile:     - Age: 72-year-old    - Gender: Female    - Race: Caucasian - more likely to develop DVT    - Occupation: Retired  with a predominantly sedentary lifestyle     Slide 3: Past Medical History     - Past episodes of varicose veins.    - Previously on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) post menopause.    - History of cancer  specifically ovarian cancer  10 years ago.    - No previous episodes of thrombosis.    - No genetic background of thrombotic disorders.     Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms     - Patient presented with unilateral swelling in right lower limb  persistent for nearly a week.    - The swelling was associated with mild pain and tenderness.    - Shortness of breath upon exertion noticed for past two days  no history of chest pain.  Slide 5: Diagnosis & Management      - Initial examination and Doppler ultrasound confirmed DVT in the right popliteal vein.    - Due to the shortness of breath  a CT pulmonary angiography was done  which ruled out any pulmonary embolism.    - The patient was treated with anticoagulants for immediate DVT management.    - Arrangements were made for close monitoring and therapeutic interventions  including compression stockings to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome.  Slide 6: Considerations & Conclusions     - Our patient represents a typical demographic for DVT. Even though cancer has been in remission  the history of malignancy  coupled with HRT and a sedentary life  are significant risk factors.    - Elderly females post-menopause have an elevated risk due to hormonal changes and co-existing morbidities  emphasizing the need for increased awareness and timely intervention in this group.    - Regular follow-ups are mandatory to ensure adherence to treatment and recognize complications early.  Slide 7: References       (This will include the current medical literature from which the case was inspired and other general resources about DVT.)  Slide 8: Questions & Discussion   Open the floor for questions  address concerns  and delve deeper into the strategies for risk reduction  early detection  treatment options  and complication management of DVT in similar patients.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,3,100,Title: Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1:  Introduction - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a severe health condition and constitutes a significant portion of the venous thromboembolism cases each year.  - It primarily affects the leg veins  including the femoral  popliteal  or calf veins.   Slide 2:  Demographics - For accurate representation  the patient subject for this case study is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  aligning with literature indicating the highest incidence of DVT among older adults  particularly in men.  - Occupation: Retired  former construction worker.  - Location: Lives in the Midwestern United States.   Slide 3:  Past Medical History - Personal History: The patient is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago  with a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  - History of venous disease  including varicose veins.  - Underwent a knee replacement surgery approximately 2 months ago.  - Family history of heart diseases and DVT.   Slide 4:  Presenting Symptoms - Patient complains of pain  swelling  and warmth over the left calf area for the past 2 days  - Non-radiating pain aggravated by standing and reduced somewhat in a recumbent position  - No fever  no chest or abdominal discomfort   Slide 5:  Diagnosis - Clinical presentation and past medical history suggest the likelihood of Deep Vein Thrombosis.  - Confirmed by Ultrasonography and D-dimer test  which exhibits clot in the popliteal vein and elevated levels respectively.   Slide 6:  Management and Prevention - Patient has been prescribed anticoagulants (Warfarin) to prevent clot growth and potential embolism. - Use of compression stockings advised to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. - Lifelong prevention strategy involves strict follow-up  weight management  promoting physical activity  smoking cessation counseling  and moderation of alcohol intake.  Slide 7:  Conclusion - This case highlights the role of age  personal health habits  family history  and post-operative status in the development of DVT.  - Proactive prevention and patient education can significantly reduce the risk and complication of DVT.    Referenced: - Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - American Heart Association (AHA) - National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.  - Current medical and healthcare literature.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,2,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Lowery Age: 60 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Office worker (mostly sedentary) BMI: 29 (Overweight) Lifestyle: Mostly sedentary  occasional swimming Smoking Status: Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago) Alcohol Consumption: Moderate (1-2 drinks per week) Residence: Urban setting  Medical History: 1. Was diagnosed with Type II diabetes eight years ago  currently controlling with metformin. 2. Occasional hypertension  controlled with ACE inhibitors. 3. Has had two major surgeries in the past - appendectomy 20 years ago and knee replacement three years ago. 4. Mr. Lowery had a minor heart attack five years back for which he underwent angioplasty. 5. Family history of venous thromboembolism (mother and elder sister)   Presenting Problem: Mr. Lowery presented to the ER with complaints of acute onset of swelling  redness  and tenderness in his right lower calf and ankle. He also reported a feeling of heaviness in the leg and minor difficulty in walking. He denies any recent trauma  falls  or injuries. He has been adhering to his diabetes and blood pressure medications at home. He alleges no similar episode in the past.  This clinical picture is suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). However  it is essential to perform further diagnostic tests such as ultrasound or D-dimer tests to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed  Mr. Lowery's risk factors for DVT would include his sedentary lifestyle  obesity  diabetes  personal history of surgery  and family history of venous thromboembolism. His previous heart ailment may also contribute to his susceptibility to DVT. Immediate management usually includes blood thinners to prevent clot progression and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism  a severe complication of DVT.    Given the patient's profile and medical history  a multidisciplinary approach involving a vascular specialist  cardiologist  and endocrinologist may be beneficial in managing the patient.

The management would require confirmation of the diagnosis through appropriate investigations like Doppler ultrasonography  D-dimer testing and then subsequent anticoagulation therapy  compression stockings and lifestyle modifications.   Note: This is a typical presentation and management; the actual approach may vary based on a person's individual profile.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,4,Patient Representation:  Mr. J.M. is a 65-year-old Caucasian man who presents to the outpatient department with pain and swelling in his left lower leg. The patient is a retired construction worker from Ohio  non-Hispanic with an approximate body mass index (BMI) of 34  classifying him as obese. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack year history  having quit just over five years ago. He lives with his wife and they have two adult children. He does not take any regular medication  but acknowledges infrequent use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for occasional arthritis pain.  The patient's past medical history is significant for a pulmonary embolism ten years ago  for which he was treated with warfarin for six months. This embolism occurred after he underwent a total knee replacement surgery. His family history includes both a father and brother who experienced deep vein thrombosis  both in their 60s.   His social history reveals that he mostly stays at home since retiring  with minimum physical activity. He drinks alcohol occasionally  typically on the weekends. He denies any illicit drug use.   He is increasingly concerned because of the swelling and pain which has occurred over the past week. He tried using a heat-pad and some over-the-counter pain killers  but they didn't seem to help. The leg is not red or warm to the touch but looks noticeably swollen compared to the other leg. He does not recall any specific injury or strain to the leg.   In summary  J.M. is a 65-year-old retired  obese  Caucasian male with sedentary habits  prior history of pulmonary embolism  and a family history of deep vein thrombosis who presents with unilateral lower extremity swelling and pain  highly suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. His age  high BMI  previous personal and family history make him a typical patient according to the demographic data found in the literature regarding deep vein thrombosis. Further diagnostic tests will be needed for a definite diagnosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,5,Patient's Representation:  - Age: 52 years - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian (White) - Occupation: Long-Distance Truck Driver - Housing: Urban area - Marital Status: Married - Smoking habit: Moderate smoker - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate drinker - Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension: Diagnosed 8 years ago - Diabetes Mellitus: Type II  diagnosed 3 years ago - Obesity: BMI of 32  diagnosed 5 years ago - Previous history: One episode of pulmonary embolism  2 years ago  Presenting Complaints:  - Unilateral leg pain and swelling that has progressively worsened over the last week. - Some extent of difficulty in breathing on mild exertion  but no chest pain or dizziness.

Provided the tests confirm DVT  the patient is to commence anticoagulation therapy  with advice of lifestyle modification  regular follow-ups and education on the signs of possible complications like pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,11,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female.  Relevant Demographic Details: Based on literature  Caucasians seem to have a slightly higher risk for developing thrombotic diseases like Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Women can have increased risk due to different stages and conditions like pregnancy  postpartum period  oral contraceptive use  hormone replacement therapy. Age is an important risk factor for DVT with the risk increasing significantly after age 60.  Complete History: The patient is a 65-year-old female who works as a professor and has a sedentary lifestyle. She has a history of previous venous thromboembolism with her first DVT encounter being 10 years ago. She also has a family history of DVT. She has been on oral contraceptives during her thirties and forties and currently on hormone replacement therapy because of post-menopausal symptoms.  She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she is on medication. In the past  she has undergone a total knee replacement surgery  increasing her susceptibility to DVT. The patient has a BMI of 30 and previous history of smoking  now quit. She does not have history of any malignancy  and her thrombophilia screen was negative.  The patient presented with swelling and pain in her right leg  which had been worsening over the past week. The pain is mainly in the calf area. There are no significant findings on her chest examination and no signs of a pulmonary embolism.  Her vital signs indicate a slightly elevated heart rate. Ultrasound confirms presence of DVT in the right leg. Blood tests show an elevated D-dimer level. The patient doesn't have any allergies to medications.  The patient lives alone and has limited support within the home environment. She has expressed concern about her ability to manage her condition.  Risk Factor Assessment: All the factors above including her age  previous history of DVT  family history  sedentary lifestyle  history of hormone replacement therapy and knee replacement surgery  obesity  and history of smoking worsen her risk profile for DVT. Her hypertension and hyperlipidemia also indicate poor cardiovascular health.  This comprehensive medical history helps in building the case for the treatment plan for DVT considering her risk factors and helps to pinpoint areas where lifestyle modification could decrease risk. Thus  suitable preventive and treatment strategies can be planned against recurrent DVT  given her particular health scenario and living conditions.  Treatment plan should also include self-care methods for DVT and involve caregivers or nearby healthcare providers for any assistance required considering her living condition.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,17,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Gender: Male Age: 62 years Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Desk job (Accountant) Marital Status: Married Healthcare: Private Insurance Socioeconomic Status: Middle class Living Situation: Lives with wife and has a sedentary lifestyle  Medical History:  Mr. John has a history of obesity (BMI 32) and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past seven years  which has been reasonably managed with Metformin. He also has hypertension (mostly systolic)  which he has been controlling with the help of prescribed antihypertensive drugs (Lisinopril  Hydrochlorothiazide).  He had an uneventful knee replacement surgery two weeks ago and since then  he has been immobilized during the recovery period. He has had a similar surgery on his other knee five years ago and a laparoscopic gallbladder surgery ten years ago without any postoperative complications. He is a former smoker  quit around fifteen years ago  with a 20 pack-year history. He drinks occasionally but in moderation.  There is a significant family history of deep vein thrombosis as his mother was diagnosed with DVT in her late 50s.  Current Presentation:  Mr. John Doe presents to the emergency department with complaints of marked swelling in his postoperative leg for the past two days  along with warmth and redness over the calf region. He also reports a slight increase in localized pain  unrelated to mobility. Some mild shortness of breath is also reported  with a few episodes of cough without expectoration. No chest pain  fever  or other systemic symptoms were reported.   These behaviours in clinical perspective  medical history of obesity  type 2 diabetes  hypertension  recent immobilization due to knee surgery  genetic predisposition  and former smoking habit could probable risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). As a result  a comprehensive diagnosis is required to confirm the condition.   Potential Problem Representation:  By evaluating the given information  the current problem appears to be a probable case of Postoperative Deep Vein Thrombosis. Considering his demographic and clinical history  risk factors are immobility due to the recent surgery and obesity  Family history of DVT and his older age. Hence  an evaluation including D-dimer assay  Doppler ultrasound of the affected limb  and potentially a CT pulmonary angiography (given his mild respiratory symptoms) should be performed for diagnosis confirmation.   Proper clinical intervention involving anticoagulation therapy  lifestyle modifications and potential use of compression stockings should be considered thereafter  pending test results.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,18,Patient Profile: Ms. X is a 60-year-old Caucasian female residing in an urban area.  Chief Complaint: She reports a 4-day history of increasing swelling  tenderness  and warmth in her right lower leg.  Past Medical History: Significant for obesity (BMI: 33)  hypertension controlled with Lisinopril  and a history of left-sided deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post-knee replacement surgery 5 years ago.  Family History: Her mother has a history of stroke while her father had DVT and subsequently pulmonary embolism.  Social History: She is a retired office manager  living with her husband. She quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol socially. She has a sedentary lifestyle since her retirement.  Medication History: She takes Lisinopril 10 mg daily for her hypertension. She is not on any anticoagulants.  Personal History: She denies the use of illicit drugs or any form of physical activity. She has a high intake of processed and fatty food. She has limited mobility due to weight and arthritis.  Review of Systems: Systems review is largely negative  except for the recent complaint in her leg. No shortness of breath or chest pain has been reported.  Physical Examination: On examination  her right calf is swollen and warm to touch with some tenderness on the posterior aspect. The circumference of the right calf is larger than the left.  Risk Factors: Notable risk factors include her obesity  previous history of DVT  a sedentary lifestyle  and family history of clotting disorders.  This patient represents a typical case of DVT as she has many known risk factors resonating with current literature. DVT more commonly affects older age group  especially those living sedentarily. Obesity  history of DVT  positive family history  and sedentary lifestyle are also identifiable risk factors. Her medical history and lifestyle contribute to her risk  and her symptoms suggest a possible DVT. Plan would include diagnostic evaluation and if DVT is confirmed  long-term anticoagulation therapy would be initiated.    References: 1. Heit JA  Spencer FA  White RH.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,19,Demographic Characterization:  Mr. John Smith is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  a heavy-smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. He is a financial analyst and leads a sedentary lifestyle as the nature of his job involves prolonged sitting. He is married and belongs to a middle-income family. Mr. Smith is also a social drinker and enjoys one to two drinks per day. He recently joined a weight loss programme due to a BMI of 31 kg/m^2  indicating obesity.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol level which has been managed with medication for the past ten years. He also had hip replacement surgery one year ago  which required a prolonged period of immobilisation. His family history includes his father  who had a pulmonary embolism at the age of 60  and his mother  who was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her late sixties.   Presenting Problem:  Mr. Smith has complained about swollen  painful and warm to touch right calf over the past two days. He also reported a dull ache in the same leg when standing or walking. Upon further questioning  he mentions he just returned from a business trip that involved a long flight. His symptoms and risk factors raised a high suspicion for deep vein thrombosis.   This profile has been crafted in accordance with demographic literature on DVT  which shows that risks are higher for individuals over the age of 40  those who are overweight or obese  individuals with a sedentary lifestyle or prolonged immobilisation  those with a family history of DVT or pulmonary embolism  and smokers. In addition  long-distance travelers are highlighted as an at-risk group due to prolonged sitting during travel.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,20,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Patient: 58-year-old Caucasian female  Occupation: office work  predominantly sedentary lifestyle Residential Location: urban area  Presenting Problem: The patient complains of swelling  pain and warmth over the area of the right lower leg for the last three days.   Past Medical History: 1. Unresolved varicose veins for 10 years. 2. History of oral contraceptive use for 15 years. 3. Non-smoker. 4. BMI: 26 (Overweight) 5. No past record of surgeries  trauma or injuries. 6. Family history of thromboembolic disease - mother had pulmonary embolism (PE) at age 60.  Relevant Physical Exam Findings: 1. Physical examination reveals localized swelling  redness  and warmth over the right calf region.  2. Positive Homan's sign - pain in the calf with forced dorsiflexion of the foot. 3. No distinct respiratory distress  chest pain  or arrhythmias.  Laboratory findings yet to be obtained. The physician suspects Deep Vein Thrombosis based on the clinical presentation and past history.  This case indicates classic symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Several demographic factors and items of the medical history draw attention as major risk factors of DVT: female gender  older age  sedentary lifestyle due to office work  unresolved varicose veins  the history of oral contraceptive use  overweight and family history of thromboembolic disease. While the patient is not a smoker  her sedentary lifestyle and being overweight still contribute to an increased risk factor for DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,21,Problem Representation:  Patient Details: - Age: 65 Years old - Gender: Female  - Race: Caucasian White (Since DVT is most common in Caucasians) - Occupation: Retired - Smoking History: Former smoker - Alcohol: Occasional drinker - Residence: Lives alone  Presenting Complaint:  Patient presents to the clinic complaining of swelling  redness  and pain in her right leg. She also reports feeling warmth over that area. She reports no recent history of trauma and has not been overseas in the past few months.

The left leg appears normal. Homan's sign is positive (pain on forced dorsiflexion of the foot).   According to multiple epidemiological studies  this patient’s demographic characteristics (older age  female gender)  lifestyle factors (smoking history  obesity  sedentary lifestyle)  and relevant medical history (hypertension  diabetes  previous knee arthroplasty  history of cancer) contributes to her risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,22,Patient Profile:  1. Demographics:      - Age: 65      - Gender: Female      - Race: Caucasian - Studies find that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has a higher prevalence rate among Caucasians.      - Occupation: Office worker - Prolonged sitting may increase the risk for DVT      - Lifestyle: Sedentary - Little physical activity such as regular exercise could increase the likelihood of DVT.  2. Medical History:       - Past history of DVT or PE: Patients with a past incidence of DVT are more likely to develop DVT again.      - Family history of clotting disorder: Certain inherited conditions such as Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation can increase the risk of DVT.      - Comorbid conditions: Hypertension and obesity.      - Smoking: It's known to raise the risk of developing blood clots.      - Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)/Contraceptive Pill: These medications increase the level of certain clotting factors in your blood.      - Past surgeries: Particularly hip  knee or female reproductive organ surgery.      - Cancer: Certain types of cancer or cancer treatments can increase levels of certain substances in your blood that help blood clot.      - Varicose veins: Varicose veins can cause venous stasis  increasing the chances of a clot.  3. Current Symptoms:       - Swelling in one or both legs      - Pain or tenderness in a leg  which may only happen when standing or walking      - Increased warmth in the area of the leg that's swollen or painful      - Red or discolored skin on the leg      - Veins you can see      - Tiredness in your legs  4. Present Medications:       - Antihypertensive Medications      - Hormone Replacement Therapy Drugs.  This problem representation aims to present a typical picture of a patient who could be at high risk for developing DVT. The factors included span across demographics  personal and medical history  as well as active symptoms and medications  all of which could play a role in the development and diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. However  it is important to remember that each patient is unique and may not exactly fit this profile. The problem representation thus serves as a guide rather than a definitive checklist.   Note that this is a hypothetical profile. Each patient's presentation may contain some of these characteristics and may lack others based on the individual's specific circumstances and medical history. Discussing possible risk factors and symptoms with a healthcare provider is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,23,Patient Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who is overweight with a BMI of 35. She has been a heavy smoker (1 pack/day) for the past 25 years. She has a sedentary lifestyle with a desk job that requires 8 hours of continuous sitting per day. She has rarely participated in physical activities for the past 10 years. In addition  she reports frequent cross-country flights for her job in the last 5 years.   Past Medical History: She has a documented history of hypertension  which has been inconsistively controlled by her medication regime due to poor adherence. She also has suffered from varicose veins for several years and was recently diagnosed with intermittent claudication. She takes oral contraceptives for menopausal symptoms. Her father died of a pulmonary embolism in his sixties  and her mother suffered a stroke at the age of 79. There is no documented history of any malignant diseases.  This patient's demographic profile fits one that is more susceptible to developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Factors such as her age  sex  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and smoking habit increase her risk. Her varicose veins  intermittent claudication and history of hormonal therapy are additional vascular risk factors. Finally  her family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cerebrovascular accidents is a concerning genetic factor. This information suggests that her risk for DVT is significantly elevated  warranting further investigation and preventive strategies.

The pain is on her left calf and is of a dull ache  progressively getting worse. No chest pain  no shortness of breath.  Physical Examination: -Left calf appears edematous and erythematous compared to the right side. There is warmth over the area as well.  Lab Investigations: -D-dimer test: Positive  Based on this representation  the patient's advanced age  history of DVT and PE  family history  prolonged immobility due to the recent long-haul flight  active smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and varicose veins increase her risk for developing deep vein thrombosis. The recently developed unilateral leg pain and swelling further corroborate this suspicion. The positive D-dimer test supports this as well.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,29,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Female Age: 67 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired; previously working in a desk bound job with minimum physical movement Smoking Status: Non-smoker  Alcohol Use: Moderate drinker Body Mass Index: 28 kg/m2 (classified as overweight)  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a complaint of pain and swelling in her left calf for the past week. She noted the pain to be gradual in onset  initially mild  and has progressively worsened especially when walking. She described the pain as a deep aching sensation and noticed warmth over the affected area. She denies any trauma or injury to the area.  Past Medical History:  1. History of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 20 years ago  reasonably controlled. 2. Hypertension for the last 15 years  on anti-hypertensive medication. 3. Pulmonary embolism 5 years ago  treated appropriately and has since been in regular follow-up. 4. Hysterectomy due to fibroids 10 years ago.  Medication History:  1. Metformin for diabetes. 2. Amlodipine for hypertension. 3. Aspirin daily for history of pulmonary embolism.  Family History: Mother died of stroke at 72. Older sister has venous thromboembolism history.  Social History: The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle. Since retiring  she became less physically active and has gained significant weight. She lives alone in a two-story house.  From this case  we suggest the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis based on the presenting complaints  past clinical conditions  and history of venous thromboembolism in the family. Further diagnostic tests such as Doppler ultrasound  D-dimer  and possible CT angiogram would be necessary to confirm this suspicion. She is in the high-risk group due to her history of PE  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history. The fact that she was previous on daily aspirin and still developed these symptoms further emphasizes her risk profile. Regular follow-up with her primary care physician or a specialist may be required to manage her condition effectively.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,30,Problem Representation:  Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Female Patient   Demographical Characteristics:  1. Age: 56 years old 2. Sex: Female 3. Ethnicity: Caucasian 4. Occupation: Office work (sedentary lifestyle) 5. Social History: Non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  BMI: 29 (Overweight)   Relevant Medical History:  1. Recent Surgery: Patient had a total knee replacement surgery 4 weeks previous. 2. Comorbidities: Hypertension and Type-II Diabetes Mellitus. 3. Medication: Regular medication includes anti-hypertensives and insulin. 4. Previous DVT: No history of previous DVT or pulmonary embolism.  5. Family History: Father expired due to pulmonary embolism associated with undiagnosed DVT  mother with type-II diabetes mellitus. 6. Trauma: No significant injury or trauma in the past. 7. Pregnancy and Birth Control Pills: Patient is post-menopausal and does not take birth control pills.  Clinical Presentation:  Patient presents with unilateral leg swelling  tenderness  redness  and warmth (right leg). She also complains of mild difficulty in breathing which started a few days prior.  Literature suggests that deep vein thrombosis is common in individuals remains on bed rest or immobilization after orthopedic surgeries. It is more common in older individuals  particularly over the age of 60  and slightly more common in women. Risk factors include a family history of DVT or PE  long periods of immobility (such as long flights or bed rest)  presence of blood clotting disorders  obesity  and presence of other underlying conditions such as cancer or inflammatory conditions  among others. In this case  the patient's recent knee replacement surgery  age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and family history put her at a higher risk for DVT.  It is crucial to diagnose and manage DVT promptly since it can lead to severe complications like pulmonary embolism (PE)  which is life-threatening. Diagnosis is usually based on presenting symptoms in combination with diagnostic tests such as ultrasound  blood tests  and sometimes  venography. Treatment is primarily based on anticoagulant medications  which can help to prevent further growth of the blood clot and reduce the risk of PE.

She is moderately active and participates in local book clubs and gardening groups.   Presenting Problem: The patient has come in today complaining of discomfort and swelling in her leg  which she has been experiencing intermittently for the past week. Upon asking about the potential triggers  she cited prolonged periods of sitting (during her long haul flight). She also mentioned a warmth around the swollen area  along with some skin color change to a pale or bluish shade. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath or episodes of fainting.   Past Medical History: - Has a history of obesity (BMI 32) - Treated for breast cancer 10 years ago with chemotherapy and radiation therapy - Previous left hip replacement surgery 4 years ago - Regularly on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for post-menopausal symptoms for the past 5 years - Has controlled hypertension managed by medication - No known allergies  - Non-smoker but used to smoke a packet a day for 25 years  quit 15 years ago   Family History: Both parents deceased. Father had a history of cardiovascular disease. Mother had a history of stroke. The patient’s younger sister was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis 6 years ago.  Representation of the Problem: The symptoms of leg swelling  discomfort  and changes color in conjunction to her history of cancer  hormone replacement therapy  sedentary lifestyle  obesity and family history suggest a possible case of deep vein thrombosis. Further clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing are required to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. The patient's previous smoking habit and controlled hypertension also elevate her risk. The recent long haul flight may have been a precipitating event. Her physical activities need to be understood in detail to understand their contribution towards her present symptoms. Cognitive and emotional aspects also need to be addressed to understand her complete health status. In addition to her physical health issues  the psychosocial aspects of her living alone also need assessment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,34,Patient Profile: --------------  Name: Mrs. Jane Smith   Age: 69 years old  Sex: Female  Race: Caucasian  Marital Status: Widowed   Occupation: Retired supermarket cashier   Education: High school graduate  Residence: Lives alone in a suburban house  has a part-time caregiver  Insurance: Medicare  Problem Presentation: -----------------------  Chief Complaint:  -Mrs. Smith reports experiencing a persistent ache and swelling in her left lower leg for the past week. Upon further questioning  she admits to decreased mobility in the last few days due to the aching leg.   Relevant Past Medical History: -Right total knee arthroplasty performed eight years ago  -Recent hospitalization for pneumonia three weeks ago; was immobile for a few days and received antibiotics for the treatment.  -Active smoker with 45 pack years -Mrs. Smith takes a daily low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention  -Has hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide  -Recently started on omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease -Denies previous history of blood clots or similar issues in the lower extremities. -Family history of stroke in her mother   Physical Examination:  -General: appears distressed due to pain -Left lower extremity: Warm to touch  visibly swollen (compared to the right)  tenderness along the distribution of the left medial thigh and calf veins.   Preliminary Diagnoses: -Deep vein thrombosis   This patient presentation is consistent with the typical demographics and risk factors associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). According to the literature  DVT is more common in the elderly  with a significant increase in incidence after the age of 40. Risk factors include recent surgery or immobilization  which Mrs. Smith has had due to her hospitalization for pneumonia. As she is a smoker with hypertension  her vascular health and blood flow may be compromised. Her recent commencement on omeprazole may also have some bearing given its potential interaction causing blood clotting disorders. This enhances the probability of a venous thromboembolic event occurring. Her physical examination findings of tenderness along thigh and calf veins  as well as warmth and swelling in the area are highly suggestive of DVT.

The symptoms became apparent about two weeks ago and have gotten progressively worse  provoking her to seek medical treatment.  Patient Demographics:  The patient is married  has two adult children  and lives with her husband in a suburban neighborhood. She retired from her job as a high school teacher 6 years ago. The patient is a non-smoker but consumes alcohol moderately. She does not have any known drug allergies.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  for which she has been taking medication for the last 8 years. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 3 years ago and was placed on anticoagulants as a part of her treatment regime. The patient underwent a total knee replacement surgery approximately 2 years ago. She maintains a mostly sedentary lifestyle due to moderate osteoarthritis in her hip.  Current Symptoms:  Patient reports a painful  red  and swollen region in her left lower leg  slightly below the knee. The pain has been worsening slowly over two weeks and is exacerbated on walking or extending the leg. Over the last couple of days  she has developed a mild fever and feels fatigued.  This presentation is consistent with a recent study showing that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) typically occurs in patients aged between 60 and 70  those who lead a sedentary lifestyle  post-surgery cases  as well as those with a history of hypertension  atrial fibrillation  and diabetes. DVT is also more common in women.   The chosen demographics and medical history for the patient outline one of many possible scenarios for a patient who might present at a health facility with DVT. These descriptors serve as important predictors and risk factor evaluators before initial diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic decision-making.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,51,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 60 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired office clerk Marital Status: Married Children: Two adult children Country of Residence: United States  Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Doe presents with swelling  warmth  and pain in her left calf  which is visibly red and swollen. She also complains of a heavy ache and increased warmth in the affected area. She reports recent shortness of breath with mild exertion.   Demographics: She is a retired Caucasian office clerk  a demographic risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as Caucasian race has higher risk for thrombotic events  and prolonged sitting associated with her past work. She is 60 years old  and the risk of DVT increases with age.   Past Medical History: Her history is significant for recurrent urinary tract infections managed with antibiotics. Two years ago  she underwent a total left hip replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. Post-surgery  she was put on low molecular weight heparin but discontinued on her own due to easy bruisability. She has a history of occasional smoking until 5 years ago.  Medications: Mrs. Doe is currently on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for post-menopausal symptoms.  Family History: There is a positive family history of thrombosis as Mrs. Doe's elder brother was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism in the past.   Social History: She reports a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. She lives with her husband and has regular visits from her adult children. She denies any alcohol use and has quit smoking five years ago.  This profile allows us to infer that Mrs. Doe has multiple risk factors for DVT  including advanced age  previous orthopedic surgery  personal and family history of venous thromboembolism  ERT  sedentary lifestyle  and past history of smoking. We are concerned about the presence of DVT given her symptoms and the risk of a possible pulmonary embolism due to her reported shortness of breath. Due to her risk factors and presenting symptoms  urgent diagnostic workup is warranted.

The symptoms seem to worsen with walking  standing or when the leg is dangled. She also mentioned experiencing some shortness of breath  further increasing the medical team's concerns.  Demographic Information: As per literature  the incidence of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is higher amongst Caucasians and increases with age  with most cases occurring in individuals above 60 years. Urban living and sedentary lifestyle  which can be inferred from Rebecca’s retired status  also contribute to increased risk. Moreover  women are slightly more likely to develop DVT than men.  Medical History: Rebecca is a former smoker  having quit approximately 30 years ago. She has a history of hypertension  which has been well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril) for the past 10 years. She has also been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for hot flashes since her menopause started 5 years ago  increasing her risk for DVT.   There is no reported family history of coagulation disorders. She has no personal history of cancer or DVT. She's allergic to aspirin and has occasionally been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis pain  which she stopped 2 weeks ago due to gastrointestinal discomfort.  In her surgical history  she has had cesarean sections two times (35 and 33 years ago)  and a total knee replacement of her right knee 3 years ago.  Additional Risk Factors: From the information  few risks factors for DVT are identified in Rebecca's case. These include old age  prolonged periods of immobility  the presence of comorbidities like hypertension  and hormone replacement therapy usage.    This information will help the medical team formulate a working diagnosis  and guide them on appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis  following which a treatment plan can be formulated and explained to the patient.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,58,"Representation:  Patient Profile ID: 001   Demographic Data:  - Age: 68 years - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Sedentary lifestyle - Weight: 220 lbs - Height: 5'3"""" - BMI: 39 (Obesity)  Past Medical History:  - History of Orthopedic Surgery (Hip Replacement) 6 weeks ago. - Chronic Heart Failure - Hypertension  controlled with medication  - Past smoking history. Quit 20 years ago  smoked for 30 years. - Family history of blood clotting disorders  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient came into the clinic complaining of one sided leg pain and swelling in her left leg that has been persistent for a week. The location of pain and swelling is in the calf muscle. The pain gets worse when bending the foot. The skin over the left leg is warm to touch. She also noted a mild fever and general feeling of being unwell.  Diagnostic Notes:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is highly suspected due to her recent orthopedic surgery  sedentary lifestyle  age  obesity  history of chronic heart failure and hypertension. These factors increase the risk of blood clot formation. The persistent pain  swelling  and warmth over the calf muscle are classic symptoms of DVT. Family history of blood clot disorders also raises the possibility of a genetic predisposition.  Considerations for further diagnostic and therapeutic actions:  1) Confirmation of DVT via diagnostic tests such as D-Dimer  ultrasonography (gold standard)  Venography etc. 2) If DVT is confirmed  immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy will be necessary. 3) Due to her history of heart failure  consideration of potential pulmonary embolism should be part of the clinical decision-making process. 4) Genetic testing for clotting disorders could be considered given her family history. 5) Patient education on lifestyle modifications to address obesity and improve overall cardiovascular health. 6) Regular follow-ups to monitor the response to the treatment."

Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  on medication. 2. Obesity - BMI 30 with a history of unsuccessful weight loss attempts. 3. Past smoker- quit 15 years ago. 4. Fracture of the tibia 6 months ago  left immobile for a prolonged period. 5. Family history- Father had deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism. 6. No known genetic disorders. 7. History of intermittent claudication. 8. No allergies reported.  Presenting Complaints:  1. Swelling in lower left leg that started gradually over the past few days. 2. The patient also presents with reported heat and redness in the same area. 3. Severe pain in affected leg  especially on moving. 4. Shortness of breath and mild chest pain for past 1 day.   Relevant Facts:  As per literature  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is more common in individuals over 60 years of age. It is also more common in individuals with a history of prolonged immobility  recent surgery or trauma  underlying malignancy  and in those taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Some genetic conditions can also increase the risk of DVT. Hypertension  obesity  and smoking  all of which are present in Mr. Mccallister's medical history  are independent risk factors for DVT. The regular use of antihypertensive medication is another reported risk factor. The family history also suggests a higher predisposition to DVT in Mr. Mccallister's case. Patients usually present with asymmetrical leg swelling  pain  and may also report systemic symptoms such as shortness of breath  which might suggest possible pulmonary embolism  a known complication of DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,64,Patient Profile:  Patient A is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  retired administrative executive  married with two children. Her weight is 170 pounds and height 5’6”. She resides in a suburban area  is an occasional smoker and has a history of consuming alcohol socially. She has a sedentary lifestyle  with repeated history of long-haul air travel.   Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of being frequently diagnosed with varicose veins. She had previously undergone an ovariohysterectomy at the age of 45 due to uterine fibroids and has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) since then. She has type 2 diabetes  managed with oral anti-diabetic agents. She was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years back  which is controlled by anti-hypertensives. She has no family history of any hereditary diseases or cancers. There is no known history of any allergies.  Current Presentation:  Patient A recently experienced a sudden onset of swelling and pain in her right lower leg. The leg also appeared reddish-blue and felt warmer than its surroundings. She did not recall injuring the leg recently. Suspecting it to possibly be deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  she has now visited the clinic.  Demographic Considerations:  Statistics indicate that DVT generally affects adults over the age of 60  and Caucasians have a higher risk compared to other ethnic groups. Other significant factors include the patient's gender (female)  history of hormone replacement therapy  prolonged immobilization (sitting during long-haul flights)  and sedentary lifestyle  all of which also increase the risk. Moreover  her medical history which includes diabetes  hypertension  varicose veins and occasional smoking can potentially contribute to developing DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,71,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Patient Identifier: Patient X Age: 67 years old Sex: Female Demographic: Caucasian  resides in a rural area  retired school teacher Behavioral Characteristics: Non-smoker  moderate alcohol use  Presenting Problem: Patient X is complaining of pain  swelling  and warmth in the lower part of her left leg. She also mentions that there is a discoloration  appearing redder than the other leg.  Medical History: Patient X has a history of abdominal surgery 8 weeks ago. Additionally  she had been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol about six years ago. Patient X had been prescribed medication for these conditions  which she has been taking as per instructed by the physician. No known allergies to medications.  Family History: Her mother suffered a stroke at an older age  and her father had cardiovascular disease.  Travel History: She has not traveled for at least 12 months.  Social History: She lives with her husband. She is moderately active  taking walks around her community  gardening  and practices yoga regularly. She has a diet that consists of lean meats  fruits  vegetables  and whole grains  with a treat of sweets once a week.  Preventive Measures: She undergoes regular check-ups and imaging studies in relation to her hypertension.  Past DVT/PE History: No past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).  Medication: - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension - Statins for high cholesterol  Review of Symptoms: Patient X has no recent trauma or injury that could account for the pain in her leg. She does not have any changes in her vision  speech  and has never experienced chest pain or breathing difficulties.  This information suggests a typical deep vein thrombosis in a patient with a prior history of abdominal surgery  hypertension  and high cholesterol. The surgery and her age may have contributed to her current condition due to potential periods of immobilization post-surgery and the natural aging process.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,72,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: • Gender: Female • Age: 65 years old • Ethnicity: Caucasian  • Weight: Obesity (BMI=32) • Lifestyle: Sedentary  past history of smoking  Presenting Complaint: • Swelling in one of the legs • Pain and tenderness in lower limbs • Reddish discoloration  • Warmth over the affected area    Past Medical History: • Previous incidence of deep vein thrombosis • Underwent hysterectomy 5 years ago • Regular take of hormonal replacement therapy • History of varicose veins  • Diagnosed with Factor V Leiden mutation • Family history of thrombotic disorders  Clinical Examination: • Unilateral leg edema  erythema • Positive Homan's sign (calf pain at dorsiflexion)  This problem representation is based on typical risk factors for DVT. The patient is the female who is in an older age population  has a past medical history suggestive of numerous risk factors including previous incidence of DVT  surgery (hysterectomy)  use of hormonal replacement therapy  and genetic mutation. The patient demographic and clinical presentation also represents the typical DVT patient characterized in most literature. For example  DVT often occurs in older individuals over 60 years old  and is more common in women especially those with a history of hormonal therapy or surgery  which can increase the risk of blood clots. Obesity and sedentary lifestyle also contribute to this risk. Her signs and symptoms  such as unilateral leg swelling  pain  redness  and warmth  are classic for DVT. Her positive Homans' sign is a clinical suggestion of DVT  although it is not definitive. Among Caucasians  Factor V Leiden mutation is a common genetic risk factor for thrombotic disorders. Her family history of thrombotic disorders further increases her risk.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,73,Patient Profile: - Name: Abraham Rodriguez  - Gender: Male - Age: 66 years - Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino - Occupation: Retired - Residence: Live Alone  Medical History: - Past deep vein thrombosis: Yes  - History of malignancy: Prostate cancer treated 3 years ago - Previous Pulmonary Embolism (PE): No - Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2): Yes  using diet control - Hypertension: Yes  on medication - Family history: Father had DVT; Brother had PE; Mother had a stroke. - Previous Surgeries: Prostate surgery (3 years ago) - Smoker: Former  quit 5 years ago - Alcohol: Social drinker    Present History: - Presented with pain and swelling in the right lower calf for the past one week - Unable to walk without discomfort - No history of recent surgery or long travel - Vital signs: Blood Pressure - 130/85 mm Hg; Heart Rate - 85 bpm; Respiratory Rate - 18 breaths per minute; Oxygen Saturation - 96% (room air) - Consume a diet that is high in salt and saturated fats; low in fruits and vegetables  Assessment & Plan: - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) seems probable given the patient's past history  clinical presentation  and family history.  - Further workup required with d-dimer blood test and Doppler ultrasound. - Pending results  high risk accrues for anticoagulation therapy.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,74,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Age: 65 Years Old Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Weight: Overweight (BMI: 30) Social History: Sedentary lifestyle  non-smoker  and occasional alcohol consumer.   Presenting Complaint:   The patient presents with leg pain and swelling in the calf  which has gradually worsened over past weeks. The patient also reports a warmth and redness over the area of pain.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of prolonged bed rest after orthopedic surgery 3 months prior. Her past medical history also includes use of birth control pills  Hypertension and occasional flights across the coast. She has no known allergies.   Family History:   Mother had a blood clot in her late 60s and father died of heart disease.   Possible Diagnosis:   Given the episodes of long-lasting inactivity  recent surgery  family history  use of birth control pills  history of hypertension  and characteristic symptoms  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is highly probable.  Suggested Tests:  To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differential diagnoses  some of the tests suggested include Doppler Ultrasound Exam of the extremity  D-Dimer Test  and possibly a Venography. These tests would help to visualize the thrombus or clot in the vein and measure clot-dissolving substances in the blood.  Management:  In case DVT is confirmed  anticoagulant therapy or blood thinners such as heparin  warfarin  or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) would be initiated. The focus would also be on the patient's lifestyle changes including increased physical activity  weight loss  and quitting oral contraceptive pills.  Note: The statistical representation included here is broadly adequate but individual variations may occur. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,75,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Female - Occupation: Retired teacher - Nationality: Caucasian  - Region of residence: Urban   Presenting Problem:  - Left leg pain and swelling  Demographics:  According to literature  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is more common in older adults  with the incidence rate increasing significantly after 60 years of age. Although DVT affects both genders  women tend to be at higher risk due to factors such as pregnancy and hormone replacement therapy.   Medical History:  - Past DVT episode 7 years ago - Long term hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal symptoms - Underwent hip replacement surgery 5 years ago - History of smoking  quit 10 years ago - Moderate alcohol consumption  - No family history of DVT - No history of genetic blood clotting disorders  These aspects of the patient's medical history are significant as each of these factors is associated with a higher risk of DVT. Past DVT and surgery can lead to an increased risk of DVT. Hormone replacement therapy  especially in older women  has also been associated with a higher risk of blood clots. Although she quit smoking a decade ago  this has also been associated with an increased risk of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,76,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Alice Jenkins Age: 61 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired office worker Address: North Carolina  USA Marital Status: Married BMI: 33 (classified as obese)  Medical History:   - Hypertension for past 10 years  controlled with medication. - Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. - A history of varicose veins in both legs. - History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg about 2 years ago  treated with anticoagulants. - The patient underwent a hysterectomy at age 40 due to heavy menstrual bleeding. - No history of smoking or alcohol use.  Present Complaint:  Mrs. Jenkins presents with pain and swelling in her right lower limb  which has been worsening over the past two days. She also reported feeling a warmth over the area and limited mobility in her leg.   Indications:  Given her past medical history of deep vein thrombosis  and the current presenting symptoms  it is highly likely that she may have recurrent deep vein thrombosis in her right lower limb. Given her history of obesity  hypertension  type 2 diabetes and her post-menopausal status  Alice is at an increased risk of developing DVT.  References:  According to data  the annual incidence of DVT varies from 53 to 162 per 100 000 individuals in the general population. Factors which increase the risk include older age  obesity  prolonged immobility  surgery  pregnancy and puerperium  oral contraceptive use  hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  malignancy  and inherited or acquired thrombophilic disorders.  This patient's presentation aligns well with the typical demographic for DVT patients  as the average age of initial DVT presentation tends to be around 60 years. Furthermore  conditions such as a high BMI  hypertension  diabetes mellitus are often associated with DVT incidence  according to various studies.   References: 1. Heit JA (2005).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,80,Patient Representation:  - Identifier: Patient X - Gender: Female - Age: 60-year-old - Ethnicity: Caucasian (53% of patients with DVT are White according to literature) - Occupation: Office worker (sedentary lifestyle)  Medical History: The patient has a personal history of multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis including:  1. Obesity: Patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 33 (obese class 1).  2. Previous DVT: Patient had a confirmed DVT episode 5 years prior. 3. Limited mobility: She works from home and does not engage in any physical activities. 4. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): The patient has been taking hormone replacement therapy for menopause symptoms for the past 6 years. 5. Family History of DVT: Her mother and aunt both had DVT.  Current Presentation:  Patient X presented to the emergency department with complaints of swelling in her right lower limb which has been persisting for a few days. She also mentions experiencing pain in her calf while walking. She has denied any shortness of breath  chest pain  or history of recent trauma/surgery.   Assessment:  Given her previous history of DVT and current symptoms  there is a high suspicion for recurrence of DVT. This is further exacerbated by her risk factors such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and HRT use.  Plan:  She would need to undergo diagnostic tests  such as a D-dimer test  followed by an ultrasound for confirmation if needed. Considering the strong suspicion of DVT  anticoagulation initiation should be considered even before the diagnostic results. Difference in the management may occur based on the confirmation of diagnosis and her risk stratification. She would also need lifestyle modification counseling including but not limited to dietary changes  exercise  and possible reassessment of HRT. This includes a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits of HRT continued use.   In the case of a confirmed DVT  long term follow up is recommended to manage and prevent the recurrence as she is at a higher risk for DVT recurrence. This could consist of regular monitoring of her coagulation parameters if she is on anticoagulation  the periodic reassessment of her deep vein thrombosis risk  lifestyle modification  and constant evaluation for the signs of post-thrombotic syndrome.

Risk Factors and Suspected Causes: Given her age  previous hip surgery  prolonged periods of immobility due to a sedentary lifestyle  and a history of cancer with chemotherapy  she is at a high risk of deep vein thrombosis.  Possible Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Her symptoms of pain  swelling  redness and warmth in the right lower leg are all suggestive of DVT and warrant further investigation.   Plan:  1. Blood tests including clotting profile and D-dimer test  2. Compression ultrasound for further confirmation of DVT. 3. If DVT is confirmed  start with anticoagulant therapy. 4. Educate patient about risks and what to monitor. 5. Follow-up appointment in one week.  Informed consent is obtained from the patient for the mentioned tests and treatment plan.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,83,Patient Representation:  1. Presenting Condition: The patient presents with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The most common symptoms presented are pain  swelling  redness  and warmth around the area of the blood clot  in this typical case the leg.  2. Demographic Information: - Age: The patient is a Caucasian male  aged 60 years. - Occupation: The patient is a business executive  hence a sedentary lifestyle. - Residence: The patient lives in an urban area in Los Angeles  California. - Socioeconomic status: The patient has a high socio-economic status.  According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the U.S is estimated to be between 300 000 to 600 000 per year  and it's proportionately higher in those aged over 60  as well as in males and Caucasians compared to other ethnic groups.   3. Past Medical History:  - The patient had a previous DVT episode five years ago. - The patient underwent hip replacement surgery two months ago. Surgery is a known risk factor for DVT. - The patient has a significant smoking history of about 30 pack-years.  - The patient has been managing hypertension for the last ten years.   Research published in the American Journal of Medicine shows a clear link between previous VTE episode  recent orthopedic surgery and risk factors like smoking and hypertension to the development of DVT.   4. Medications:  - Antihypertensive medication for controlling blood pressure. - No current anticoagulation treatments.   5. Family history:  - The patient's mother had a past history of stroke  and his father had a pulmonary embolism.  Genetics also play a role in the risk of developing DVT  with a higher risk for individuals with a family history of venous clotting disorders.  6. Lifestyle: - The patient has a history of prolonged periods of immobility due to his job nature and recent post-operative recovery.   Prolonged immobility is a known risk factor for DVT as per Harvard Health Publishing. He does not engage in regular physical exercise. Despite several quit attempts  the patient is still a regular smoker.   Given this representation  a plan for the patient's treatment  including anticoagulation therapy  lifestyle modification and regular follow-ups  might be considered.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,84,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: White/Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer   Past Medical History: - Chronic smoker (30 pack years) - History of uncontrolled Hypertension - History of Type II Diabetes Mellitus - History of high cholesterol  - Obesity (BMI 32) - Family history of venous thromboembolism - History of total knee replacement surgery 1 month ago  Presenting Problem: Mr. Johnson presents to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of increasing pain and swelling in his left leg  heel to upper thigh. He also reports occasional shortness of breath. The patient recognizes the severity of his symptoms and is concerned about his well-being. He denies any recent trauma or injuries to the affected leg. His mobility has been noticeably reduced over the past few days due to the unilateral leg pain.   This patient presentation aligns with studies that have found higher risk of DVT in patients who have uncontrolled diabetes  are smokers  have hypertension  a history of surgery (especially orthopedic)  and a family history of DVT. This particular profile also takes into consideration that DVT is more common in people over 60 years of age and in men.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,6,91,Problem Representation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Identification:  Mr. X  Demographics: Mr. X is a 60-year-old Caucasian man who is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 (age and BMI are risk factors for DVT). He is married and has two children — one son and one daughter. They live in a suburban area of the city where he was a former corporate executive and has now taken early retirement. Smoking has been a part of Mr. X's daily routine since his mid-20s  making him a heavy smoker.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a past history of recurrent urinary tract infections caused by long-term indwelling urinary catheter use (a significant risk factor for DVT). He also suffers from hypertension  for which he has been taking anti-hypertensive medications for the past 10 years.  He underwent an elective knee replacement surgery 8 months ago and had a prolonged immobilized period post-surgery which predisposed him to DVT.   Family History: Mr. X's mother had an embolic stroke at the age of 72 and his elder brother suffered from a DVT episode in his early 60s. Difference in family history indicates that Mr. X has a genetic predisposition to thromboembolic disorders.  Social History: He is a retired corporate executive  and he currently works part-time as a consultant. He admits to chronic stress  a sedentary lifestyle  and a diet high in saturated fats.  Lifestyle: Mr. X has been a heavy smoker for 35 years and drinks alcohol socially. His level of physical activity is limited. He may live a relatively sedentary lifestyle  potentially contributing to his risk factor for developing deep vein thrombosis.  Conclusion:  Mr. X's age  overweight status  history of surgical intervention followed by prolonged immobilization  and family history all contribute to his current presentation of DVT. His heavy smoking habit and sedentary lifestyle add further to his elevated risk factor. His long-term catheter use due to recurrent urinary tract infections is also a critical risk factor in this case. The combination of lifestyle choices and genetic factors contribute to Mr. X's presentation of deep vein thrombosis.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,1,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in an Elderly  Diabetic Male: A Case Report   Patient Information:  A 79-year-old African-American male  living in an urban setting  presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling in the right lower extremity. The patient was moderately obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. The patient was a retiree and lived alone with home assistance services twice a week.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a significant past medical history  which included type 2 diabetes  well controlled on oral medication  and hypertension  managed with a calcium channel blocker. He had a history of ischemic stroke three years prior and was on antiplatelet therapy. There were no known allergies and he was a former smoker having quit 10 years before. The patient also reported a family history of heart disease and a brother diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his early sixties.  Current Illness:  For the past three days  the patient experienced substantial pain and notable swelling in his right calf that significantly limited his mobility. The pain was acute at the onset and progressively worsened. He denied trauma  recent surgery  or a long period of immobility. The symptoms were associated with mild shortness of breath on exertion but no chest pain.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  he was alert  oriented  and appeared anxious. His blood pressure was 154/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/min  and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. His right lower limb was visibly swollen and felt warmer than the left  with tenderness on deep palpation. Homans’ sign was positive. The rest of the examination  including cardiovascular and respiratory systems  was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Based on presentation and physical examination  the patient was suspected of having deep vein thrombosis. D-dimer levels were elevated at 900 μg FEU/ml (>500 is positive for DVT). A Doppler Ultrasound of the right leg showed an occlusive thrombus in the distal femoral and popliteal veins  confirming the diagnosis. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right heart strain or Ischemia. Additionally  a CT Pulmonary Angiography was performed due to the shortness of breath  which ruled out pulmonary embolism.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was admitted under the internal medicine department. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) while monitoring the platelet count and renal function. After five days  the anticoagulant was transitioned from LMWH to oral rivaroxaban.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient’s hospital stay was complicated by acute kidney injury  which was managed with intravenous fluids. He reported significant pain improvement and reduced swelling over ten days. He was discharged on rivaroxaban with a follow-up appointment scheduled with his primary physician for coagulation panels.  Patient Perspective:  Although initially anxious  the patient was grateful for the timely diagnosis and management. He shared his intention to engage more actively in managing his diabetes and hypertension.  Informed Consent:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,3,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 64-year-old Caucasian Male   Patient Information  Mr. X  a 64-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes  presented to the emergency department complaining of increasing leg pain and swelling over the past four days. He described his symptoms as a cramping sensation in his left calf. Mr. X is a retired accountant and leads a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement three years ago. His medication regime includes Metformin and Lisinopril. Mr. X does not smoke or consume alcohol. His family history is significant for myocardial infarction and stroke in his father and a venous thromboembolism in his older brother. He reported no known allergies.  Clinical Findings  On physical examination  he appeared anxious and his vital signs were stable. Examination of the lower limbs showed left leg swelling with a circumference 3cm greater than the right leg. The left calf was tender to touch. Homan's sign was positive. There was no evidence of ulceration or varicose veins  and peripheral pulses were palpable bilaterally. There was no peripheral edema. His BMI was 32  indicating obesity.  Diagnostic Assessment    The symptoms  signs  and past medical history raised clinical suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A D-dimer test was conducted  which turned out to be significantly elevated. Ultrasound Doppler of the left lower limb confirmed the diagnosis by showing a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein with absence of color flow  indicating a thrombus.   Therapeutic Intervention    Mr. X was admitted and immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with a low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin)  and later transitioned to an oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban). Pain management was achieved with acetaminophen. He was also advised compression stockings to reduce swelling during the day.  Follow-up and Outcomes  Mr. X responded well to the anticoagulation therapy. His symptoms improved significantly  and a repeated ultrasound Doppler after seven days indicated recanalization of the vein. Due to the patient's existing comorbidities and the risk of recurrence  it was decided to continue oral anticoagulation for an extended period. He was also advised to undertake regular exercise  dietary changes and weight management to decrease his BMI.  The patient was educated about signs and symptoms of recurrent DVT and potential complications like pulmonary embolism. He was asked to schedule regular follow-ups to monitor his treatment progress and to manage his Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  thereby reducing the risk of future events.   Patient Perspective Mr. X expressed gratitude for the detailed explanation of his condition  the need for therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication compliance  and the possible complications signaling recurrent events.  This case provides an essential reminder of the significant complications associated with untreated DVT and highlights the importance of early detection  treatment  and modification of risk factors to prevent recurrence. It also emphasizes the need for creating awareness among patients about the signs and symptoms of DVT to promote early reporting and management. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,4,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged  Caucasian Female with a History of Prolonged Immobility Due to Hip Arthroplasty  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition that occurs due to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body  often in the lower extremities. The major risk factors include increased age  obesity  cancer  trauma  surgery  immobility  and inherited blood disorders. This report presents a case of DVT in a 58-year-old Caucasian female with a history of prolonged immobility and hip surgery.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female  hailing from a suburban community in Northern California. She works as an office manager and leads a moderately active lifestyle. Her past medical history is notable for right hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis around two months prior to her presentation. There is no history of smoking  alcohol  or recreational drug use. She has no known allergies  and her only regular medication is a daily multivitamin supplement and occasional over-the-counter analgesics for arthritis pain.  She presented to the emergency room (ER) with a complaint of sudden-onset  non-radiating pain in her left calf of 48 hours duration. The pain was exacerbated on walking and relieved by elevation of the leg. She also reported warmth and swelling in the same leg. She had no complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness. Vital signs on admission were stable.  Physical Examination disclosed a swollen  tender  and erythematous left calf. The rest of her examination was unremarkable. The Wells score for DVT was calculated  yielding a high probability.  Lab investigations revealed a marginally raised D-dimer level. Her Complete Blood Picture  renal  and liver function tests were within normal limits.  A Duplex venous ultrasound was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of DVT in the left posterior tibial vein.  Management:  The patient was initiated on anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin  transitioning to oral rivaroxaban. She was advised to elevate the leg and use compression stockings. She was counseled on the symptoms of pulmonary embolism  a serious complication of DVT.  Outcome:  At a one-week outpatient follow-up  the patient reported a significant reduction in pain and swelling. At a four-week follow-up  she had unremarkable physical findings and was continued on rivaroxaban.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing factors predisposing to DVT  such as prolonged immobility following orthopedic surgery. Despite modern prophylactic strategies  DVT remains an important differential in patients with unilateral leg pain/swelling. Prompt recognition and treatment can mitigate the risk of severe complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,5,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Asian Female with a History of Prolonged Immobility  Introduction:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a significant public health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality potential. This case report introduces a middle-aged Asian female who has developed DVT due to prolonged immobility after hospitalization.   Patient information:  A 52-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling in her left lower leg. The pain was constant and was rated 8 on the 10-point pain scale. She reported that she felt some heat and tightness in her left calf. Her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  which was reasonably well-controlled with Metformin. She had been admitted to the hospital for severe pneumonia three weeks prior and had been discharged three days earlier.  Clinical Findings:   Upon physical examination  her vital signs were stable. Her left lower leg was swollen and palpably warmer than the right. She reported pain when the calf was squeezed (Homan’s sign). There was no superficial venous distention. Her peripheral pulses were palpable.   Timeline:  Doppler ultrasound was immediately performed  which revealed the presence of a clot in the deep vein of her left lower limb confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Blood investigations were remarkable for slight elevations in D-dimer levels.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given her recent history of hospitalization and immobilization  we suspected DVT as a complication. This was corroborated by clinical symptoms and subsequently confirmed with Doppler ultrasound.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was initiated promptly in the emergency department  with an oral anticoagulant (warfarin) to be started on the following day. Compression stockings were recommended to help reduce swelling and pain.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient was re-evaluated two weeks after the initiation of therapy. Her symptoms had substantially improved. Warfarin was continued at a therapeutic dose aimed at an INR of 2.0-3.0. No bleeding complications were reported.   Patient Perspective:  The patient was appreciative of the medical team’s efforts and satisfied with her treatment process.   Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of considering DVT in patients with a history of prolonged immobilization or recent hospitalization even in the absence of traditional risk factors such as a genetic predisposition  obesity  or history of smoking. Early recognition and initiation of treatment can significantly affect these patients' prognosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,6,Case Report: Male Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Case:  This case involves a patient  Mr. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian male recently retired construction worker. He is married with two adult children  has a family history of cardiovascular disease from his paternal side. He is moderately obese with a Body Mass Index of 30.2. The patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for almost 30 years but has recently quit a year ago. The patient comes from a middle-income bracket and has a history of limited physical exercise due to his sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Mr. J presented at the clinic complaining of sudden-onset intense pain  warmth  and swelling in his right calf that has been lasting for around three days. His leg was noticeably reddened in the area of swelling. He reported no prior injury to the leg and no recent surgeries.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago. Both conditions were controlled relatively well with medication  including an angiotensin II receptor antagonist for the hypertension  and metformin and insulin for diabetes management.  Upon further questioning  Mr. J mentioned he had recently completed a long-road trip during his vacation where he spent most of his time sitting  with limited mobility. This information coupled with the symptoms he presented  served as a leading clue for the vascular surgeon to suspect deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Following diagnostic assessment including Duplex ultrasonography and D-dimer assay  Mr. J was diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis in his right leg. This fit well with the risk profile of DVT  which can include advancing age  obesity  lack of mobility  smoking history  and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.  The patient was then started on systemic anticoagulation therapy and physical measures (like compression stockings) were advised to relieve the edema and pain. Education about modifiable risks and preventive measures with regards to DVT were also given.   This single-case report underscores the importance of comprehensive clinical examination  careful history-taking  and risk assessment in diagnosing potentially dangerous conditions like DVT. In cases with the established pathology  early identification and management can significantly reduce the dangerous potential sequelae  such as pulmonary embolism.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,8,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Woman with Previous History of Myocardial Infarction - A Case Report  INTRODUCTION  We report on a case of a 57-year-old African-American woman who presented with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  further complicated by her medical history of a prior myocardial infarction.  CASE REPORT  The patient  a retired paralegal and non-smoker  has a BMl of 29  lives in urban Atlanta  Georgia  and originally sought medical care due to swelling and discomfort in her right lower limb. The patient's medical history includes hypertension  high cholesterol  and a myocardial infarction two years prior.  Presenting symptoms were progressive swelling  redness  warmth  and pain in the right calf area over two days. The woman initially attributed the discomfort to excessive walking during a recent short vacation. However  when the swelling and pain failed to improve  she sought medical care. She denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or occurrence of similar events in the past.  Physical examination revealed a moderately obese woman in no distress but noticeable swollen  erythematous and warm right lower limb. There was tenderness upon palpation. There were no visible varicose veins.  Hg was 12.9 g/dL  platelets were at 350 000/uL  and WBC count was 7800/uL. Her coagulation profile  as well as kidney and liver function tests  were within normal limits. The patient was placed on low molecular weight heparin and her right leg ultrasonograph reported Deep Vein Thrombosis in the right popliteal and femoral veins.  Treatment included low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  warfarin  and graduated compression stockings. The patient's care was further managed by an Internist and a Vascular surgeon with considerations for her previous cardiac issues as part of her treatment plan.   The patient had an uneventful recovery and at her six week follow-up  a repeat ultrasound scan showed recanalization of the affected veins.   CONCLUSION  This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion for DVT in patients with leg swelling and pain  particularly in those patients with additional risk factors. Awareness of DVT and its potential complications  such as pulmonary embolism  is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment  including in postmenopausal women with a history of myocardial infarction. The treatment approach should be multidisciplinary considering the patient's overall medical condition.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,9,Title: An Unusual Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A Case Report  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in the deep veins  primarily in the lower extremities. It can be life-threatening if the blood clot dislodges and travels to the lungs  causing a pulmonary embolism. Here  we present the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian female with a non-typical presentation of DVT.  Patient Information:  The patient  Mrs. B  is a 69-year-old Caucasian female from the rural Midwest region of the United States. She is a retired schoolteacher  married  and lives with her husband. Her height and weight at presentation weighed 155 lbs (70.3 kg) and height 63 inches (160 cm)  BMI 27.4  classifying her within the overweight range.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented with a 4-day history of gradually worsening left upper extremity pain and swelling without obvious precipitating incident. The patient reported no recent prolonged travel or surgery  no significant medical history  and is a non-smoker.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a swollen left arm with a positive Homan’s sign. Her lower extremities were unremarkable with good capillary refill and detectable pulses bilaterally. Lower extremity swelling  pain  or tenderness  typically associated with DVT were absent.  Diagnostic Assessment: Lab findings displayed slightly elevated d-dimer levels. Ultrasonography revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein. Given her age  lack of typical risk factors  and unusual presentation  a thorough malignancy work-up process was initiated  which came back negative.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient received intravenous heparin acutely  then was switched to oral anticoagulation (warfarin) accompanied by compression therapy. The patient showed substantial improvement  with a reduction in pain and swelling.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Over three months of follow-up  her symptoms fully resolved. She remained compliant with her anticoagulation therapy and demonstrated no signs of post-thrombotic syndrome. Her case highlights the importance of high clinical suspicion when presented with unexplained unilateral limb swelling  despite the absence of common risk factors.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed surprise by her diagnosis  having no prior knowledge of DVT occurrences outside of the lower extremities. She reported satisfaction with the management provided and pledged to remain compliant with follow-up visits and medication.  Conclusion: This case report adds to the literature on atypical presentations of DVT and draws attention to maintaining a high level of clinical suspicion in older patients presenting with unilateral limb swelling  even without traditional risk factors for DVT.   Keywords: Deep Vein Thrombosis  DVT  Atypical presentation  Upper extremity DVT  Unilateral limb swelling.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,10,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a 65-Year-Old Caucasian Female  Case presentation: We present the case of a 65-year-old woman of Caucasian ethnicity who operates a market stand  hence being on her feet for extended periods daily. She is a former smoker and has a significant history of hypertension for the past ten years  but her adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication (lisinopril) is inconsistent. She abstains from alcohol and denies any history of illicit drug use. There are no known allergies reported.   Clinical narrative:  The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of acute onset  severe pain on her left leg that worsened with walking. Moreover  she noted increased left leg swelling and a mild degree of warmth over the calf. She had no history of recent surgery  immobilization  or previous venous thromboembolism  nor was there a family history of blood clotting disorders. She has been menopausal for 15 years with no history of hormone replacement therapy.  On examination  the left leg was slightly erythematous  warm to the touch  and noticeably swollen  with calf circumferential measurement 3 cm larger than the right. There was mild tenderness on compression testing at the level of the left gastrocnemius muscle  but no superficial venous distension.  Investigations:  Bedside doppler ultrasound performed in the ED confirmed our suspicion of acute DVT  with evidence of occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her laboratory results were significant for a D-dimer level of 1100 ng/mL (normal:0-500 ng/mL)  while her complete blood count  plasma electrolytes  liver and renal function tests were within normal limits.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s clinical picture  ultrasound findings  and elevated D-dimer level  the diagnosis of acute left lower leg DVT was made.  Management:  The patient was admitted to the hospital for initiation of anticoagulant therapy  beginning with parental unfractionated heparin. Following a cardiology consult  she was transitioned to oral rivaroxaban and educated extensively on medication adherence  leg elevation  and wearing compression stockings. Referrals to a vascular specialist for follow-up and home healthcare services were arranged before discharge.  Discussion: This case underscores the significance of identifying DVT in an outpatient setting without known DVT risk factors such as recent surgery  genetic coagulopathy  or long-term immobilization. Poorly controlled hypertension  old age  prolonged standing  and non-adherence to prescribed medications may all contribute to increased risk. Early detection and prompt management with anticoagulants are crucial to prevent potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  this stresses the importance of patient education regarding medication compliance.

Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of intense  painful swelling in her left leg.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports the swelling started two days prior without any precipitating incident or injury and has become progressively worse. She also mentioned slight shortness of breath and slight chest discomfort  particularly during deep inhalation.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history included hypertension  controlled with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and long-term use of oral contraceptives in her younger years. She reported occasional alcohol use but denies tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient is post-menopausal with no history of hormone replacement therapy. There was no family history of DVT  malignancies or coagulation disorders.   Physical Examination: Vital signs upon admission were: blood pressure  128/82 mmHg; pulse  85 beats/min; respiration rate  19 breaths/min; temperature  36.7°C; and oxygen saturation  95% on room air. Physical examination revealed an erythematous  edematous  tender left leg. There was no cyanosis  ulceration or evidence of superficial vein varicosities.  Clinical Findings: Diagnostic workup included doppler ultrasonography  which showed occlusive thrombus in her left femoral and popliteal veins indicating DVT. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. Her D-dimer level was elevated.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted for further management. She was put on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated a day later with a plan to continue for at least three months. Measures were also taken to control her blood pressure.  Outcome: The treatment was tolerated well. Subsequent examinations and follow-up ultrasounds showed decreasing size of her thrombus  and her symptoms gradually improved. She was discharged with instructions and prescriptions for oral anticoagulants and a recommendation for regular follow-ups.   Teaching Points: This case emphasizes the importance of considering risk factors such as aging  personal history of long-term oral contraceptive use  and present control of hypertension for the development of DVT in the absence of any genetic predisposition or recent immobility. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,12,Title: A Case of Unprovoked Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 45-Year-Old Female   Patient Information:  Mrs. A  a 45-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset  unilateral right lower extremity pain and swelling. She is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  and had no recent travel or periods of prolonged immobility. Additionally  there was no history suggestive of recent trauma or injury. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is within normal limits. She is gravida 2  para 2 with an unremarkable obstetric history.   Past Medical History:  She was relatively healthy without any significant past medical or surgical history. She has never been on any long-term medication. Mrs. A denied any personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other clotting disorders.   Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a painful and swollen right calf  measuring 3 cm larger than the left. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.   Investigations:  Venous Doppler ultrasonography was performed  which confirmed thrombosis in the mid and distal segments of the right popliteal vein and calf veins. Her D-dimer levels were markedly elevated. The patient’s complete blood count  electrolytes  renal  and liver function tests were within normal limits. Coagulation profile including Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) was also within normal limits.  Screening test for thrombophilic states including Factor V Leiden mutation  Prothrombin gene mutation  and Antithrombin  Protein C and S deficiencies were also carried out to rule out potential hereditary or acquired thrombophilia but all tests came negative.  Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  physical examination  and diagnostic results  she was diagnosed with right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Treatment:  The patient was admitted and managed with anticoagulation therapy (Low Molecular Weight Heparin followed by a conversion to a novel oral anticoagulant). She responded well to the treatment and was discharged with advice to continue oral anticoagulant therapy.  Discussion:  This case represents an unprovoked DVT in a middle-aged female with no identifiable high risk factors. Unprovoked venous thromboembolism may indicate presence of an underlying malignancy. However  an extensive malignancy workup was negative in this case.  Follow-up:  On her follow-up appointment 1 month later  she reported alleviation of symptoms and continues to be monitored.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering DVT even in patients without identifiable risk factors. Physicians should be aware of the potential for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling. In cases of unprovoked DVT  it could be imperative to perform thorough investigations in order to rule out other potential pathologies including malignancies. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,13,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Female  Introduction:  A 62-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with acute-onset left lower extremity (LLE) pain and swelling that had worsened over a three-day period. The patient reported no recent travel  injury  or known hypercoagulable state. The patient was post-menopausal and has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) since the onset of menopause. She has a previous medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and obesity.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a retired school teacher  lives alone with no children and no prior history of smoking or alcoholism. Her body mass index (BMI) is 34  indicating obesity. She had been on antihypertensives and diabetic medications with poor adherence. On presentation  she was in moderate distress from pain. Vital signs were stable: Blood pressure 142/90 mm Hg  heart rate 86 beats/min  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  and oral temperature 98.9 °F. The LLE was significantly swollen  erythematous  and warm to touch compared to her other limb. Pedal pulses were diminished but present bilaterally. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigation:  Venous Doppler of the LLE was immediately ordered and demonstrated a non-compressible left femoral vein consistent with deep vein thrombosis. Complete blood count revealed slightly raised white cell count of 12 000/mm3 and hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL. Her prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. D-dimer level was significantly elevated at 800 ng/mL (reference value < 500 ng/mL). Fasting glucose level was a bit elevated at 148 mg/dL while her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was started on therapeutic unfractionated heparin and admitted to the general internal medicine ward. Upon further questioning  the patient revealed irregular use of her HRT  so the decision was made to discontinue them due to the significant risk factor they pose for deep venous thrombosis. On hospital day 2  she was transitioned to oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban. Her pain and swelling progressively improved  and she was discharged on hospital day 4 to continue rivaroxaban with outpatient follow-up. Her adherence to antihypertensive and diabetes medication was also reinforced during hospitalization and post-discharge.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the risk factors for deep vein thrombosis  including HRT  obesity  hypertension  and diabetes. A comprehensive assessment of the demo-social and clinical background of an individual is necessary to optimally manage and prevent the recurrence of DVT.                                                                                                                                                    Conclusion:  Even in the absence of clear hypercoagulable state or physical injury  health care providers should maintain a high degree of suspicion for DVT  especially in patients with multiple risk factors like in our patient. An early diagnosis and intervention can prevent potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism.

Patient Information:  The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male known to have metabolic syndrome; being a known hypertensive and type 2 diabetic with BMI classified in the obese range. The patient denied any history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse. However  sedentary behavior and poor dietary habits were noted. The patient’s family history includes a brother with heart disease and a mother deceased from a cerebrovascular accident.  Clinical Findings:  On presentation  his pulse rate was 96bpm  blood pressure of 142/90 mmHg  and SpO2 of 97%. Physical examination revealed palpable cords  warmth  and tenderness along the course of the left calf muscle  suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. The remainder of the examination was non-significant.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Complete blood counts reported increased platelet counts. Prothrombin time  partial thromboplastin time  and international normalized ratio (INR) were within normal ranges. D-dimer level was significantly elevated. An ultrasound Doppler of the left lower extremity was done which confirmed extensive deep vein thrombosis of the left popliteal vein.  Treatment:  The patient was admitted for management. Anticoagulation was immediately initiated with an intravenous heparin drip with a plan to overlap with oral warfarin until INR was within therapeutic range. Additionally  anti-edema measures such as leg elevation and compression stockings were initiated. The patient was closely monitored for potential complications.  Clinical progress:  The patient responded well to treatment with a noticeable reduction in pain and swelling. At discharge  the patient was advised on the importance of regular follow-up checks  and was educated on lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  healthy diet  and strict control of his hypertension and diabetes.  Discussion:  This case serves as a reminder that DVT can occur in middle-aged patients  particularly those with metabolic syndrome. The presence of metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for DVT due to hypercoagulability related to obesity and hypertension. Sedentary behavior can increase the risk further  as can long-haul flights as seen in this case. Therefore  these patients must be encouraged to manage their metabolic syndrome efficiently and motivated to lead an active lifestyle with proper diet and exercise to prevent DVT and potential life-threatening complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,15,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged African American Male: A Case Report  Case Presentation:  Our patient  a 50-year-old African American male office worker from Maryland  presented to the emergency department with complaints of increasing left calf pain over the last week. The pain was described as a dull ache  exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest. He also reported mild swelling in the affected limb but denied any shortness of breath  chest pain  fever  or trauma.  Demographics:  The patient is a never smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He does not use any illicit substances. He has a BMI of 29  indicating overweight  but no previous history of bariatric surgery. He has a history of type II diabetes and hypertension  which are well managed with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. Patient is non-compliant with regular exercises and has mostly a sedentary lifestyle given his profession. No significant family history for coagulation disorders or DVT was reported. He lives with his wife and two adult children in an urban apartment.   Clinical Findings:  Physical examination demonstrated a mildly swollen  erythematous left lower extremity. The patient’s vitals were stable. No calf tenderness on Homan's sign was noted. Distal pulses were equally palpable bilaterally. There were no signs of superficial venous inflammation or ulcers. Rest of his investigation including routine blood tests were unremarkable apart from a slightly raised D-dimer level.  Diagnosis:  Given the presentation  Virchow’s triad was considered  which suggested a potential high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The slightly elevated D-dimer level further supported this suspicion. A Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity was performed and confirmed the presence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein suggestive of DVT.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was initiated on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) overlapped with Warfarin as per the standard guidelines for DVT management. He was hospitalized and observed for 48 hours. He had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged home with instructions to continue warfarin for at least three months and attend regular follow-up appointments. He was also educated about the signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the need for immediate medical attention if such signs or symptoms occur.   Further instructions given to him included lifestyle modifications like regular exercise  healthy diet  weight optimization  and proper control of his diabetes and hypertension. He was also educated about proper use of compression stockings. The patient has remained asymptomatic at his follow-up visits.   Conclusions:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing DVT in patients presenting with unexplained leg pain and mild swelling  even in the absence of risk factors such as surgery or immobilization. Given the potentially catastrophic complications like PE  clinicians should consider DVT in differential diagnosis  particularly in patients with type II diabetes  hypertension  and in African American populations. Regular monitoring and adherence to anticoagulant therapy are pivotal to the management of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,16,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Female with History of Obesity: A Case Report  Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an often underdiagnosed and serious condition involving the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein  typically in the leg.  Case Report:  We report a case of a 62-year-old Hispanic female  Mrs. A  presenting to the emergency department with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Demographics: The patient is a post-menopausal  non-smoking female. She is a retired teacher residing in an urban setting. She is married and has two adult children. The patient is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35  and has a history of physical inactivity. She denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  for which she is on medications. Her medications include metformin 500mg twice daily and lisinopril 20mg once daily. She does not report any allergies. She has no previous personal or family history of thrombotic events. She has not undergone any surgeries or been immobilized recently.   Presenting complaints: The patient was admitted with a 2-day history of severe pain and swelling in the left lower limb  without any recognizable triggering event. The patient denied experiencing redness  fever  or other systemic symptoms.   Examination and Investigations: Physical examination showed a swollen  erythematous left lower limb that was warm to touch. Her vital signs were stable. D-Dimer test was positive.  On further evaluation  a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound demonstrated deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal and posterior tibial veins. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism in a CT pulmonary angiogram. Routine blood investigations showed elevated blood glucose and cholesterol levels.  Discussion: In this case  obesity  diabetes and physical inactivity  likely added to the patient's pro-thrombotic state  leading to the formation of DVT. Obesity and diabetes are independent and modifiable risk factors for DVT. The presence of these risk factors should alert practitioners to a heightened risk and potential need for prophylactic management in appropriate cases.   Management and Outcome: Patient was admitted and started on anticoagulant therapy  with low molecular weight heparin initially  then bridged to oral warfarin. The pain and swelling in her leg improved significantly with treatment. She was counselled regarding weight reduction  physical activity and blood sugar control.  Conclusion: This case highlights the adverse thrombotic risks posed by obesity and diabetes. Healthcare practitioners need to be vigilant about screening for DVT among patients with these comorbidities  even in the absence of other traditional risk factors such as recent immobilization or surgery. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,17,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Caucasian Female: A Case Report   Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a significant public health concern worldwide that  if left untreated  may progress to potentially fatal outcomes like pulmonary embolism. We present a case of a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with DVT with a history of hormone replacement therapy and sedentary lifestyle.  Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented to our outpatient clinic  complaining of unilateral leg swelling and persistent pain in her left lower limb for five days. The patient  a retired teacher  was a non-smoker and denied any alcohol intake. She had a sedentary lifestyle and had been experiencing an increased body mass index  recorded at 32. Her past medical history included a bilateral total knee replacement two years ago and menopause at the age of 50. Since menopause  she had been on hormone replacement therapy  which she discontinued a year ago due to concerns of breast cancer risk after reading about it online. Her family history was remarkable for hemophilia in a male sibling  now deceased.  Physical examination revealed left calf swelling with tenderness  warmth  and erythema extending from mid-calf to ankle without any signs of superficial vein thrombosis. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. A clinical suspicion of DVT was made based on the Wells score  and a diagnosis was reached after confirming through Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities which showed an occlusive thrombus in the superficial femoral vein.   Discussions: The patient was managed with standard anticoagulant therapy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) high-bandage compression followed by oral anticoagulant medications. Follow-up at the end of one month showed significant improvement in her symptoms. The patient was encouraged to maintain an active physical lifestyle  reduce weight  and counseled about the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy.  Conclusion:  This case report emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in a patient of post-menopausal age presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially those with risk factors including prolonged periods of inactivity  obesity  and history of hormone therapy. It also highlights the significance of appropriate patient education about medications and the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.

It typically occurs in the lower extremities and may lead to pulmonary embolism if untreated. This case report illustrates a straightforward but challenging case of DVT  involving a 55-year-old Caucasian female patient with no previously known medical history.  Case Report: Patient Information:    A 55-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of right leg swelling and mild discomfort for the past two days. She denied having any fever  chest pain  shortness of breath or hemoptysis. Her previous medical history was notably empty except for two previous pregnancies without any apparent complications and a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. She had no family history of thromboembolic disease. She does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol.   Clinical Findings:    The patient appeared uncomfortable  but she was not in acute distress. Physical examination revealed unilateral edema and mild erythema on the right lower limb  starting from mid-thigh to the ankle with a noticeable difference in size compared to the left lower limb. The right lower limb was warm to touch. No signs of superficial vein inflammation were found and peripheral pulses were intact. Her vitals were stable  with a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  a heart rate of 85 bpm  respiratory rate of 16/min and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.   Diagnostic Assessment:  The D-dimer test was positive and subsequent Doppler ultrasonography of the right lower extremity confirmed the diagnosis of an acute DVT involving the full length of the femoral vein down to the popliteal vein. A Chest CT scan was performed  which did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Other laboratory data including complete blood counts  coagulation profiles  renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies was negative. Screening for malignancies was also negative.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Anticoagulation was initiated with intravenous low-molecular-weight heparin and transition to oral anticoagulants was done on the second day. Analgesics were administered to relieve the patient's discomfort.  Follow-up and Outcome:  On follow-up after three months  the patient's symptoms were resolved completely. A repeat Doppler showed the complete resolution of the thrombosis. The patient was advised on further preventive measures including staying hydration  regular mobility  and continued anticoagulation therapy.  Discussion:  Despite being a physically healthy  non-obese  non-smoker patient  this case underscores the fact that DVT can occur even in the absence of major risk factors. Regular mobility and hydration  along with awareness of the symptoms  is critical for prevention and early diagnosis of DVT.  Conclusion:  DVT affects individuals of all demographics. Despite an otherwise healthy lifestyle and no prominent risk factors  our patient was diagnosed with DVT which underlines its uncertain nature. This case report strongly advocates for a high degree of clinical suspicion and immediate diagnostic work-up for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral lower limb swelling and pain  irrespective of the presence or absence of known risk factors.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,24,Title: Case Report on Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged Male  Introduction:   This case report presents a 52-year-old white male  presenting with symptoms suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Patient Information:  The patient is an accountant from middle socio-economic background  living in an urban area in Oregon  USA. He is a married individual who is moderately active  does not smoke  and drinks alcohol infrequently. He is of average weight  with a BMI of 24.6. He has no known allergies.  Clinical findings:   The patient came to the hospital complaining of pain and swelling in the left calf  which he noticed 3 days prior. He reported the pain intensifying over time  with mild difficulty in walking but no other associated symptoms. On examination  there was tenderness  redness  and warmth over the left lower leg  particularly over the calf.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Taken the patient's age  gender  and symptoms into account  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was considered. The patient was sent for further evaluation  including ultrasonography of the lower limb and D-dimer test. Ultrasonography indicated the presence of an occlusive thrombus in the left lower extremity  confirming the DVT diagnosis. The D-Dimer test also yielded positive results.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted  and anticoagulant therapy initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). After an initial course of LMWH  the patient was transitioned to long-term oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban.  Follow up and Outcome:  The patient's condition improved significantly over the day  with reduced pain and swelling. He was discharged with guidelines for taking oral medication and instructions for leg exercises at home. Frequent clinic visits for repeat investigation and monitoring were scheduled.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension for the past five years and has been on medication.  Discussion:  Male gender  increasing age  and personal history of thrombotic conditions such as hypertension are known risk factors for DVT. In this case  his sedentary job and lack of regular exercise potentially added to the risk.  In conclusion  clinicians should keep a high degree of suspicion for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg edema and pain  especially in the presence of risk factors  and timely management can lead to excellent patient outcomes.   This case underlines the importance of patient education in maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent such conditions  encouraging regular movement and exercises  especially in sedentary jobs.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,25,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-menopausal Female with Obesity  Abstract: We report an unusual case of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a post-menopausal  obese female. Despite having no significant family history or known genetic predisposition  she experienced an extended period of inactivity  which may have contributed to the formation of the thrombus.  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who originally presented with left lower limb pain and swelling. She is a retired school teacher  married  and resides in a suburban region. She denies usage of tobacco and consumes alcohol in moderation.   Medical History: She has a past history of obesity (BMI: 33)  controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on Metformin and hypertension managed with Telmisartan. She has no history of recent surgery  trauma  or prior similar episodes of leg pain or swelling. There is no known case of cancer or cardiovascular disease. She denies usage of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy post-menopause.  Clinical Findings: Her vital signs on presentation were stable  with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Physical examination of the left lower extremity showed swelling and warmth without any discoloration. Homans' sign was present.   Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory tests including Complete Blood Count (CBC)  renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. Her A1C was slightly elevated at 7.2%. D-Dimer assay was significantly high  prompting referral for a Doppler ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed a thrombus in the left femoral vein  confirming DVT.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was diagnosed on an outpatient basis. Therefore  we initiated treatment with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) as an at-home treatment  alongside oral anticoagulation consisting of Rivaroxaban. She was advised to elevate her legs and apply graduated compression stockings.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was instructed to follow up after 5 days and then every month. On follow-up at two months  she showed significant improvement with reduced leg swelling  no pain  and normalization of D-Dimer levels. No adverse events were reported during her treatment period.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief with the improvement and agreed to continue medication and lifestyle modifications for weight loss  such as regular exercise and a balanced diet  to mitigate the risk of recurrent DVT.  Conclusion: This report emphasizes that DVT can occur even without significant familial or genetic predisposition. Physiological changes post-menopause  long periods of inactivity  and obesity can increase the risk  indicating the importance of regular exercise and weight management among post-menopausal women.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,26,Title: A case report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Male with a History of Smoking and Hypertension  Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a significant health issue primarily triggered by blood clotting in deep veins  commonly affects the veins in the lower leg and thigh  making it predisposed to embolization and potential severe complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE). On that note  we report a notable case of DVT in a 57-year-old Hispanic male with relevant co-morbid conditions.  Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. J  a 57-year-old Hispanic male  with a history of hypertension and smoking  presented with complaints of increasing pain and swelling in his left lower limb for the past one week. He is a regular smoker with a 30-pack-year history  and also reports an abrupt increase in sedentary lifestyle due to the recent quarantine measures for COVID-19. His medical history includes essential hypertension which is controlled on medication for a decade. He has no previous family history of venous thromboembolism or other blood clotting disorders.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed swelling  warmness  tenderness  and erythema of the left leg  especially in the calf region. A Homan's sign was positive. His vitals recorded mild hypertension with elevated heart rate.  Diagnostic Assessment: A duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities confirmed the diagnosis of DVT  revealing a thrombus within the left popliteal vein. His D-dimer level was significantly elevated  further supporting the diagnosis. Other laboratory findings  including full blood count  platelets  PT  APTT  liver  and renal function tests  were within normal limits except for slightly increased LDL levels.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately administered subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as a part of anticoagulant therapy and placed on strict bed rest with the left leg elevated. Lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation  were encouraged.  Follow-up: Upon his outpatient follow-up after 1 week  he demonstrated significant improvement with reduced swelling and pain in the affected limb. His anticoagulant therapy was switched to oral warfarin  aiming for a target INR of 2-3  with further follow-ups arranged for monitoring.   Conclusion: This case report underscores the significance of considering DVT as a differential in patients with unilateral leg swelling  especially when presenting with risk factors such as advanced age  smoking  hypertension  and recent immobilization. Early detection and prompt anticoagulant therapy are key to reduce morbidity and potential complications of DVT.   Key Learning points: 1. High index of suspicion is needed in symptomatic patients with risk factors for DVT. 2. Timely duplex ultrasound and appropriate laboratory tests assist in confirming DVT diagnosis. 3. Immediate anticoagulant therapy and lifestyle modifications are essential in DVT management.

It can occasionally lead to life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE).  Case Presentation: We report a case of Mr. A  a 62-year-old Caucasian male from rural Georgia  who presented with the acute onset of bilateral lower limb edema and tenderness.  History: Mr. A  a retired carpenter  had a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril 10mg and Atorvastatin 20 mg per day  respectively. He was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. He had a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity and did not follow any specific diet plan.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient’s vital signs were within normal limits. However  his bilateral lower extremities were found to be swollen and tender  right more than left. A Homan’s sign was positive on the right. There was no erythema or palpable cord noted. No other significant clinical findings were observed.  Investigations: Doppler ultrasound of both lower extremities was performed  which revealed clot formations in the deep veins of both legs  more extensive in the right. He had slightly elevated D-dimer levels. The thought of a possible malignancy leading to DVT was ruled out after a complete blood count  liver function tests  and computed tomography revealed no abnormalities.  Treatment and Follow-up: Based on the DVT diagnosis  Mr. A was initiated on low-molecular-weight heparin therapy associated with warfarin. His medications were adjusted over time to maintain the target INR. The patient was counseled about the importance of improving lifestyle habits such as regular physical activities and a balanced diet  controlling weight  and being compliant with medications.   At a three-month follow-up  Mr. A reported a significant reduction in swelling and pain. On repeat Doppler ultrasound  there was notable clot resolution. He continued his medication regimen  physical activity  and healthier diet choices  leading to an overall improvement in quality of life.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral or bilateral lower limb swelling  especially in individuals with risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of DVT can significantly reduce morbidity and life-threatening complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,32,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Male   Patient Information:  A middle-aged man  56 years old  of Caucasian ethnic background  presented to the hospital with complaints of pain  swelling  and redness in his left lower leg. He is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol moderately  and works a sedentary job as an accountant with long hours of sitting. He has no known allergies. The patient is married with two adult children and lives in an urban area. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 30.2 Kg/m2  implying he's obese. Family history reveals that his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 65.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a prior medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with these conditions five years ago and has been managed on antihypertensive medication (amlodipine  5 mg daily) and a statin (atorvastatin  20 mg daily). His medication has been fairly consistent over the year with good overall compliance despite occasional adjusted dosage for better management of his condition. His last documented blood pressure reading was 138/85 mmHg and LDL (Low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level was 115 mg/dL. Aside from these  his medical history is unremarkable  with no previous incidents of thrombosis or similar conditions.  Clinical Findings:  Primary physical examination revealed a noticeably swollen  erythematous left calf that was warm to touch. A positive Homans' sign was observed (pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the patient's foot). The patient also reported a low-grade fever  fatigue  and a feeling of heaviness in the affected leg.   Diagnostic Assessment:  A blood test showed an elevated D-dimer level at 800 ng/mL (normal is less than 500 ng/mL)  suggestive of a possible thromboembolic event. To confirm  a Doppler ultrasound was performed and showed evidence of a deep venous thrombosis in the posterior tibial vein. The hypercoagulable workup was negative  reducing the likelihood of a hereditary blood clotting disorder in this case.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin) at a therapeutic dose. Overlapping with the LMWH  warfarin was initiated. Once the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) reached the optimum therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0  the LMWH was discontinued.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient was discharged with a prescription for oral anticoagulation (warfarin) with instructions for strict adherence to the regime and regular INR monitoring. Lifestyle modifications were also advised  such as increasing physical activity  losing weight  and maintaining a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sodium. During the outpatient visit 1 week post-discharge  the patient showed improvements in swelling and pain. He did not develop post-thrombotic syndrome at the follow-up visit 6 months later.   In this case  the patient's age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia made him a suitable candidate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This emphasizes the importance of being cognizant of risk factors and potential indications of DVT in a similar demographic.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,33,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Previously Healthy Middle-aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition characterized by the presence of a blood clot in the deep veins  usually present in the lower extremities. We present the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male with no previous medical history.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 54-year-old Caucasian male  a professional bus driver  non-smoker  and occasional alcohol drinker  with no known drug allergies and no record of any familial diseases. The patient presented with acute  severe lower leg pain  swelling  and discoloration of the right leg which had started approximately three days before presentation. He reported no history of prior similar episodes  prolonged immobility  recent travels  or surgery. He does not take any medication and has no significant medical or surgical history.  Upon admission  the patient had a BP of 130/80 mmHg  a pulse rate of 88 beats/minute  a temperature of 36.5 °C  and was afebrile. Physical examination revealed swelling  erythema  and warmth in the right lower limb  particularly in the calf region. The Homans' sign was positive. Laboratory findings were as follows: D-dimer level was highly elevated at 2 000 ng/mL  platelet count was 400 000/mm3  prothrombin time (PT) was 14s  and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 30s.   A Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was performed which demonstrated a non-compressible right popliteal vein suggestive of acute DVT. Other tests such as chest X-ray  electrocardiogram  and urinary analysis were all within normal limits.   He was managed using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and oral warfarin. The pain and swelling began to reduce on the 3rd day of treatment. The patient was counseled about his condition and the importance of medication compliance. He was advised to stop alcohol  to increase physical activities  and to control his diet.   Discussion:  This case highlights an instance of primary DVT in an otherwise healthy individual with no apparent risk factors except his occupation  which involves long hours of immobility. This emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in the differential diagnosis of leg pain  even in patients without obvious risk factors.  Conclusion: Even though classic symptoms of DVT  such as pain and swelling  are often seen in many other diseases  clinicians should also consider DVT as a possible diagnosis  particularly in patients whose profession involves prolonged periods of immobility. Prompt diagnosis and early initiation of therapy can prevent serious complications  such as pulmonary embolism. Patient education regarding lifestyle modifications and compliance with medication is crucial in disease management. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,34,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Female with a History of Obesity and Hypertension   Introduction: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian female presenting with unilateral pain and severe swelling in the left leg. She lives in an urban setting in Chicago  Illinois  is a retired teacher  and lives an overall sedentary lifestyle.  Case Presentation: On examination  the left leg was noted to be visibly swollen  erythematous  warm to the touch  and painful. The patient has a history of obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. She's also being treated for hypertension for over a decade. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Leonoro and can't recall any recent rigorous physical activity or prolonged period of immobility. She had been postmenopausal for 13 years  but refused hormonal replacement therapy due to personal reasons. Moreover  she does not have a personal or family history of thromboembolic diseases.  Investigations: An ultrasound Doppler study of the left leg was performed  revealing acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein extending to the trifurcation of the tibial veins. Her complete blood count (CBC)  liver function test  renal function test  and coagulation profile were normal. However  her lipid profile showed hyperlipidaemia.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the hospital and started immediately on anticoagulative therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral warfarin therapy. She was closely monitored for any signs of pulmonary embolism. After 5 days of hospital treatment  her symptoms were significantly resolved. Follow-up duplex ultrasonography showed recanalization of the popliteal vein. The patient was discharged with warfarin therapy and was advised to maintain lifestyle modifications  including a healthier diet  regular exercise  and weight loss to manage her obesogenic condition and hence preventing the recurrence of DVT.  Discussion: Postmenopausal women  especially those with obesity and hypertension  may have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism  as seen in this case. This case reiterates the importance of considering DVT in patients who present with unilateral leg swelling  particularly in those who possess risk factors such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  or hypertension.  Conclusion: Clinicians should be vigilant in recognizing the common signs and symptoms of DVT  especially in patients who are at a higher risk. This early diagnosis  combined with prompt therapeutic intervention  can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with potential complications  such as pulmonary embolism. This case also draws attention to hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  which could contribute to the incidence of DVTs. Desirable control of these variables can help prevent future occurrences.

This case report presents a 48-year-old African American male diagnosed with DVT.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 48-year-old African-American male  presented at the emergency room with a 2-day history of acute onset  left lower extremity pain and swelling. The patient is a taxi driver by profession  with prolonged periods of immobility. He exhibits a 30 pack-year history of smoking and is obese with a BMI of 33.2 kg/m2. He also reported a past medical history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril  but denied any surgeries  recent trauma  previous clotting disorders  or family history of clotting diseases. Moreover  he is non-compliant with his medication and has a poor exercise habit. He does not consume any alcohol  he just smokes. His paternal grandfather had a history of stroke  and both his parents are hypertensive.   On physical examination  the patient appeared in moderate pain  vital signs were stable  but the left lower extremity was noticeably swollen and warm to touch when compared to the right. A noticeable Homan's sign was present.   Investigations: Doppler ultrasound revealed acute DVT in the left common femoral and popliteal veins. D-dimer was elevated. Complete blood count  coagulation profile  and other routine blood investigations were within normal limits. Given the history of hypertension  an ECG was performed  which did not show any abnormalities.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the hospital and anticoagulation was initiated with intravenous Heparin  subsequently bridged with oral Warfarin. Pain and swelling showed significant improvement. The patient was educated about the importance of medication compliance  encouraged to quit smoking  and reduce weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise. He was discharged on warfarin with INR monitoring in place  thrombosis clinic follow-up arranged.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the risk factors for DVT including obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  non-compliance with hypertension medication  and African American race as found in the literature. Although DVT is less studied in African Americans  some research suggests a higher risk  highlighting the importance of further study in this population demographic. The management and patient education for lifestyle modifications provide a comprehensive approach in the care for DVT.  Conclusion: Early detection and prompt treatment of DVT are essential in preventing serious complications  including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. More research is needed to understand the potential genetic or socioeconomic factors contributing to the increased risk of DVT in African American populations. Appropriate risk management strategies  including medication compliance  smoking cessation  weight management  and regular exercise  are fundamental to reducing disease recurrence and improving outcomes.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,37,Case Report:  Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a physically fit  middle-aged Caucasian female with no prior history of venous thromboembolism  Case Presentation:  The patient  Ms. A  is a 45-year-old Caucasian female who presented with progressive right lower leg pain and localized edema. She is an accountant by profession with no history of traveling in the recent past and living a physically active lifestyle  including regular gym workouts. She has no prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  malignancy  genetic coagulation disorders  nor does she smoke or consume alcohol. She denied any history of trauma or surgery in the recent past. She has no family history of thrombotic events and is not on any hormonal therapy.  Patient's height and weight were within the healthy range (BMI 22.6 kg/m2). Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  pulse rate 72 beats per minute  respiratory rate 16 per minute  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  Laboratory Investigations:  Complete blood count  platelet count  PT and APTT  renal and liver function tests were within normal ranges  indicating no hematological or systemic disorder.  Doppler Ultrasound:  The right lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound showed a non-compressible popliteal vein suggestive of DVT.  Treatment:  The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban. After discussion with the patient and considering all the benefit-risk factors  it was decided to continue anticoagulant therapy for three months  with regular follow-ups.  Discussion:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) often happens in individuals with risk factors such as surgery  immobilization  active cancer  previous DVT or PE  pregnancy  estrogen therapy  advanced age  and obesity. However  this case is an instance where DVT developed in a physically fit  middle-aged woman without any of the commonly perceived risk factors.  This case serves as a reminder that DVT can also occur in healthy and physically active individuals. Therefore  a high index of suspicion is required when patients present with unexplained leg pain and swelling.  Conclusion:  It is important to include DVT in differential diagnoses  even for patients who do not fit traditional risk profiles. Early detection and appropriate treatment of DVT are crucial to prevent complications  including death from pulmonary embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,38,Title: Case Report: Unilateral Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a Post-Menopausal Woman with No Known Co-Morbidities  Introduction:  This case report discusses a 65-year-old Hispanic female presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  with no past medical history of significant illnesses.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 65-year-old post-menopausal Hispanic woman  presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset pain and swelling in her left lower limb. The patient reports the symptoms started two days ago and have progressively worsened. The swelling was accompanied by a localized warmth and slight discoloration of the skin but no shortness of breath or chest pain were reported. The patient leads an inactive lifestyle  being retired  and does not smoke or consume alcohol. Family history revealed maternal aunt having had DVT  but otherwise unremarkable.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a visibly swollen left calf with some redness and elevated skin temperature compared to the right calf. The circumference of left calf was about 1.5 cm more than the right. The patient's vitals were stable and within the normal range. No signs of superficial thrombophlebitis were noted. No other significant physical findings were identified.  Laboratory Investigations:  A D-Dimer test was ordered which returned a positive result indicating a possible thrombotic event. Further investigation via Doppler ultrasonography was performed which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left common femoral and popliteal veins  confirming DVT.  Treatment:  The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by an oral Factor Xa inhibitor. She was given instructions for leg elevation  application of warm pack and use of compression stockings to reduce swelling and alleviate symptoms.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Over the course of the treatment  the patient’s symptoms gradually improved. After about a week  the swelling noticeably reduced and the patient reported a substantial decrease in pain and discomfort. She was advised to continue the oral anticoagulants for three months  with regular follow-ups. The patient and her family were provided with lifestyle modification counseling  including the importance of physical activity to prevent recurrent DVT events.  Discussion:  Unilateral DVT is common in elderly and obese individuals. However  the patient in this case had a normal BMI and no known pre-existing medical conditions  which suggests a need for further research on the epidemiology of DVT. In this case  genetic predisposition  gender  and sedentary lifestyle may have acted as contributory risk factors. Early detection and treatment using anticoagulants were crucial in preventing potential complications such as pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome  and recurrent DVT. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,39,Title: Diagnosis and Management of Unprovoked Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 62-year-old Female Patient  Patient Information:  A 62-year-old Caucasian female weighing 68 kg presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of increasing pain and swelling in her right lower extremity  which started approximately three days ago.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed an edematous and erythematous right lower extremity  significantly warmer than the left. Her right calf measured 3 cm larger in circumference compared to the left. The patient reported no known injury or trauma. She denied any recent periods of prolonged immobilization  recent surgeries  or long-distance travel.  History:  The patient is a former smoker  having quit around 15 years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally and denies illicit drug use. She has a family history of venous thromboembolism - her mother developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after hip surgery. Personal medical history includes hypertension controlled with lisinopril  hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin  and osteoarthritis of the knees. She has no known drug allergies.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: A D-dimer test was performed  presenting a high value of 1500 ng/mL. Given the patient’s symptoms and elevated D-dimer  a duplex sonography of the right lower extremity was conducted  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Although she had risk factors for DVT  given her symptoms of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis  the decision was made to evaluate for underlying malignancy with computed tomography (CT) of the chest  abdomen  and pelvis  all of which showed no evidence of malignancy. A complete blood count and coagulation profile were normal excluding any hematologic disorder.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted and anticoagulant therapy was initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral rivaroxaban therapy planned for a duration of at least three months.  Follow-Up and Outcome: Her symptoms improved over the following week. At her one-month follow-up appointment  the patient continued to do well  tolerating the anticoagulant therapy and with no recurrence of DVT symptoms. She was advised to continue oral rivaroxaban and regular follow-ups were planned. She was also educated about the symptoms of recurrent thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and advised to seek medical attention if these occur.  Learning Points: This case highlights the importance of considering an unprovoked DVT as a potential sign of an unknown underlying disease such as cancer. Therefore  appropriate investigations should be undertaken to rule out malignancies. Additionally  it emphasizes the management of DVT with anticoagulation therapy and regular outpatient monitoring to ensure resolution and prevent the recurrence of thromboembolic events.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,40,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  I. Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins of the body  generally in the legs  is reported in this case. This report exemplifies the intricacies of managing DVT in an individual with a history of smoking and sedentary lifestyle.  II. Patient Information (Demographics): Our patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  a computer programmer  from Wisconsin  United States. He is a smoker  with a 20-pack year history  and maintains a sedentary lifestyle due to his job nature. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 29  which indicates obesity  another significant risk factor for DVT. He reported consuming alcohol in moderation. He is married and lives with his wife and two adult children.  III. Chief Complaints and Symptoms: The patient presented severe pain and swelling in his right lower leg. He also reported feelings of warmth and redness in the area. He denied experiencing any chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath.  IV. Past Medical History: The patient has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with medications. He has no history of any surgeries or injuries. He reported a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including his father dying from a heart attack at the age of 62. No history of similar symptoms or other venous thromboembolisms are reported. He does not have any known allergies.  V. Diagnosis: With DVT suspected  a D-Dimer test was done  which came back positive. This was followed by a Doppler ultrasound  which confirmed the diagnosis by revealing clotting in the deep veins of the patient's right lower leg.  VI. Treatment: The patient was administered intravenous heparin immediately  followed by oral warfarin  with a subsequent overlapping period and INR monitoring. Lifestyle modification  including smoking cessation and increased physical activity  were advised.   VII. Outcomes: The patient's condition improved over a week in hospital  with reduction in pain and swelling. He was discharged on long-term warfarin  educated on benefits of smoking cessation  maintaining regular physical activities and on his diet to manage hypertension and diabetes.  VIII. Learning Points: This case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in middle-aged individuals presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially if they have a sedentary lifestyle  tobacco smoking history  and known risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. When managed promptly  the prognosis for DVT can be good  but delayed or missed diagnosis can lead to severe complications  including fatal pulmonary embolisms. Regular physical activity and healthy lifestyle practices remains pivotal in preventing DVT especially among high risk individuals.   This case authorizes the description in the literature about the accurate demographic representation of DVT patients  commonly reported in middle-aged to elderly  overweight males  with a history of smoking and sedentary lifestyle.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,43,Title: Unilateral Edema in a Postmenopausal Female Secondary to Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a medical phenomenon characterized by the formation of blood clots in the deep veins  typically of the lower extremities  causing substantial morbidity and mortality. This case study aims to highlight a case of DVT in a 68-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female with a significant medical history.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher with a history of hypertension and obesity  reported to the outpatient department with complaints of unilateral swelling  tenderness  redness  and warmth of her right lower extremity. Her past medical history was significant for oral contraceptive therapy for 30 years  a hysterectomy at age 52 due to fibroids  and a recent long automobile drive. The patient denied any recent surgeries  cancer  smoking or alcohol consumption  nor a family history of DVT. At the time of presentation  she had been taking antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications.  Pertinent negatives on her physical examination included elevated blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) of 32  and no signs of superficial venous dilatation or insufficiency. Upon further examination of the affected leg  there was unilateral swelling and pitting edema with mild skin warmth on touch  indicating impaired venous return. Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity showed thrombosis of several deep veins suggestive of DVT. Blood tests revealed poor coagulation function  elevated D-dimer levels  and normal platelet count.  Management: The patient was immediately administered low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and initiated on oral anticoagulant dabigatran. She was also advised to elevate the affected lower extremity and prescribed compression stockings. She was admitted to the hospital for monitoring.  Outcome & Follow-up: Her symptoms gradually improved over the course of 2 weeks with strict blood pressure control and weight management. A repeat Doppler ultrasound performed after 3 months showed a normal flow in the previously obstructed deep veins of the right lower extremity. Anticoagulation therapy was continued for six months to prevent recurrent thromboembolism.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the risk factors of DVT in postmenopausal women with hypertension  obesity  and prolonged immobility. It underscores the importance of timely intervention  in this case with anticoagulation therapy  lifestyle modifications  and the use of compression stockings  in preventing complications associated with DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,45,Title: A Case Report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Postmenopausal Woman with a History of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome  Introduction:  We present a case of a 52-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal woman who presented with a unilateral swollen and painful lower leg  later diagnosed as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Patient Information and Clinical Findings:  The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian woman  a clerical worker from a semi-urban setting  1.65 m tall  weighing 78 kg  with a BMI of 28.6. The lady is a non-smoker and only drinks socially  with no recorded drug or food allergies. Her family history showed her mother had hypertension  but no known history of thromboembolic events or cancers.  She is postmenopausal for two years and maintains an active lifestyle with no prior history of long-distance travel or recent immobilization. She reports a history of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  diagnosed in her mid-30s  and has been managing it with dietary changes and Metformin. The patient has no history of diabetes  hypertension  or any cardiovascular diseases.   The patient presented with a three-day history of progressive right calf pain  with visible swelling and warmth compared to the contralateral leg. No fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath was reported.  Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  the right lower leg was indeed swollen and a Homan’s sign was positive. Initial laboratory tests including complete blood count  coagulation profile  and serum chemistry were within their normal ranges. But the D-Dimer test was positive.  Given the clinical suspicion  an ultrasound Doppler examination of the right leg was performed  revealing a thrombus in the femoral and popliteal veins  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No signs of pulmonary embolism were observed in the further performed computed tomography pulmonary angiogram.  Therapeutic Intervention and Follow Up:  The patient was initially administered therapeutic enoxaparin and later bridged to oral direct anticoagulant  Rivaroxaban. The edema and pain improved substantially over a week following the start of anticoagulation therapy. She was also prescribed compression stockings.  The patient was regularly monitored for symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome and potential adverse effects from anticoagulation therapy. She was also counseled regarding the increased thrombotic risk potentially associated with PCOS and lifestyle modification was advised to help with weight management.  Conclusion:  This case report highlights the potential thrombogenic risk in postmenopausal women with the history of PCOS  which necessitates the early detection and therapeutic management of DVT. Further longitudinal and controlled studies may be beneficial to understand the long-term thromboembolic risk associated with PCOS.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,52,Title: Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged Caucasian Female with Hypothyroidism  Abstract:  We report the case of a 49-year-old Caucasian female who presented with recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite regularly taking anticoagulants.  Case presentation: The patient  a previously healthy woman  had developed a left lower extremity DVT four months ago. She is married  nonsmoker  non-alcoholic  and has two children. She had a medical history of hypothyroidism which was being managed with levothyroxine since the age of 44. Upon development of the first DVT  she was found to be Factor V Leiden heterozygote and was started on Rivaroxaban.  This time  she presented with a sudden onset of redness  warmth  and pain in her right leg. She denied any trauma  prolonged periods of immobility  recent travel  or surgeries. Physical examination revealed an erythematous  swollen  and tender right lower leg with a positive Homan's sign. A venous ultrasound was ordered immediately upon suspecting a DVT  which confirmed thrombosis in the right superficial and deep venous system. Her D-Dimer levels were also significantly elevated.  Given her recurrent DVT events despite compliance with her medication  she was evaluated for other prothrombotic conditions such as malignancy  autoimmune disorders  and other genetic thrombophilias.   Her complete blood count  liver function test  renal function test  ESR  CRP  urinalysis  and peripheral blood smear were in normal acceptable ranges with no signs of infections  inflammation  or malignancy. However  further genetic testing identified an additional Prothrombin G20210A mutation.   The patient was started on long-term therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin). Family members were advised to undergo genetic testing given these findings.   Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of considering genetic thrombophilias when encountering recurrent DVT especially in patients on anticoagulation therapy. In such patients going beyond routine investigations and opting for genetic testing can provide crucial insights and guide treatment strategies. Family genetic screening is equally important in such cases.  Keywords: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Recurrent DVT  Hypothyroidism  Genetic Thrombophilia  Anticoagulation Therapy

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,54,Title: Unilateral Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Male with Previous History of Stroke  Introduction:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in one or more deep veins  majorly in the legs. It can cause leg pain or swelling  but may also occur without any symptoms.   Patient Information:  The patient is a 54-year-old African American male who resides in an urban setting in Detroit  Michigan  USA. He has a history of smoking for more than 30 years and occasional alcohol intake.  Presenting Concerns:  The patient reported to the clinic with complaints of intense pain and swelling in his left lower leg. The pain reportedly exacerbated upon standing or walking. Additionally  he complained about a warm feeling in the affected area with visible redness on his skin which had been persistent for two days before seeking medical attention. No complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the left lower leg appeared swollen and red  accompanied by a tenderness through palpation. Measurement of the affected leg demonstrated a significant difference in size compared to the right lower leg  supporting the presence of edema.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Based on the symptoms and physical findings  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was suspected. A Doppler ultrasound was performed  which confirmed the presence of a large clot in the left popliteal vein. Complete blood count (CBC) was done and showed an increased platelet count. International Normalized Ratio (INR) was also increased.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Anticoagulation therapy was immediately initiated. The patient was prescribed 15 mg of Rivaroxaban twice daily for 21 days  followed by 20 mg once daily.   Follow up:  The patient was advised to follow up 3 days after discharge for reassessment and one week later for a repeat Doppler ultrasound. He was educated about the importance of medication adherence and was advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake for the prevention of recurrent DVT and other possible cardiovascular complications. He was also advised to wear compression stockings in his left leg.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed his understanding of the situation. He showed determination to follow the advised therapeutic regimen and lifestyle modifications to mitigate the risk of future incidences. He had questions about the potential for recovery and was reassured that appropriate management shall greatly reduce the risk of severe complications.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of early detection and management of DVT  especially in individuals with risk factors such as smoking  old age and history of stroke. It also underscores the significance of patient education and lifestyle modifications in disease management and prevention of complications.    
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,55,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Sedentary Elderly Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  We report a case of a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a 2-day history of a swollen  painful left leg and was subsequently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Case Presentation:  The patient is a retired office worker who has been sedentary for the past 15 years  living in predominantly white-bread suburbia in Pennsylvania  USA. He's been widowed for 3 years and lives alone. With a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  his medications include metformin and lisinopril. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history  though he quit about a decade ago. There's a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at 70.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed an erythematous  warm  and swollen left lower extremity. He also complained of sharp  one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. His vital signs were significant for a heart rate of 105 bpm and blood pressure of 148/98 mmHg. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.  Timeline:  The patient initially thought his leg symptoms were due to muscle strain from minimal activity conducted 3 days prior. Two days after the development of leg symptoms  the patient started experiencing chest symptoms  prompting an emergency department visit.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood investigations showed elevated D-dimer levels. Lower extremity ultrasonography was performed  confirming the presence of a thrombus in the left femoral vein. Given his chest symptoms  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was conducted  revealing bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE).   Therapeutic Intervention:  He was admitted to the hospital and initiated on low-molecular-weight heparin. An inferior vena cava filter was placed due to the high risk of recurrent PE.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  His symptoms improved over the next few days with resolution of the leg swelling and chest pain. He was discharged on a direct oral anticoagulant to be taken indefinitely considering the idiopathic nature of DVT and subsequent PE. Family-based interventions were recommended to reduce sedentariness  and referrals for home care support were made.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing DVT as a potential risk in the elderly population with sedentary lifestyle  even in the absence of recent surgery  trauma or malignancy. There is also a need for awareness about PE as a possible serious complication of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,56,Title: A Case Report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 50-year-old African American Male with Hypertension   Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins  usually in the legs. This report documents a case of DVT in a 50-year-old African American male.  Case Presentation:  A 50-year-old African American male residing in the urban precincts of New York presented with complaints of pain  swelling  and oedema in his right lower limb  particularly in his calf muscles. He is a local grocery store owner with a BMI of 32 classified as obese  leads a sedentary lifestyle  and has limited physical activity. He has a previous history of hypertension controlled by a standard dose of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  prescribed by his primary care physician. There is no known history of other significant diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. The patient is a non-smoker but consumes alcohol occasionally.  On physical examination  he exhibited signs of deep venous dilation - characterized by local warmth  swelling  erythema  and tenderness on his right calf. There were no signs of superficial venous thrombosis.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Following the presentation  we conducted a D-dimer test  which resulted as significantly elevated. To definitively diagnose DVT  we recommended a duplex ultrasound. The results showed presence of an obstructive thrombus in the right popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT.   Management and Outcome:  The patient was promptly started on therapeutic anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin and then transitioned to oral anticoagulant Warfarin for long term management. After a week  his symptoms improved significantly. He was further advised about the potential risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and possible complications  such as pulmonary embolism.  The patient was also recommended to follow a weight management program and increase physical activity to decrease the risk of future DVT episodes.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of considering DVT in patients with unexplained limb pain and swelling  even in the absence of traditional risk factors such as surgery  trauma  cancer or protracted immobility. Hypertension and obesity  prevalent in our patient  have been independently linked to DVT  yet are often overlooked. These risk factors warrant more research to guide effective interventions among African American populations  who are found to be disproportionately affected by hypertension.  Conclusion:  Early diagnosis and treatment of DVT can prevent fatal complications like pulmonary embolism. Obesity and hypertension may predispose individuals to the development of DVT and must always be addressed and managed during patient assessment and treatment. This case adds to the growing body of evidence linking obesity and hypertension to venous thromboembolism  especially among African American adults. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,57,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 60-year-old Male  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired construction worker married with two adult children. His BMI is calculated as 27.6  indicating that he is overweight and smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily. He is a moderate alcohol consumer and does not engage in regular physical activity. He lives in a suburban area and sees his primary care physician regularly.   Chief Complaint: The patient presented with complaints of swelling  pain  warmth  redness  and discomfort in his left calf which had been progressively increasing over the past few days. He also reported a sensation of heaviness in the same leg  but no fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath.  Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are controlled with medication. He had a hernia operation 4 years prior but recovered without complications. There is no known history of congenital blood-clotting disorders in him or his family. The patient’s mother had suffered from heart disease and his father had died from a stroke.  Investigations: On physical examination  his left calf appeared red  swollen  and was tender to touch  indicating potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood tests  including complete blood count  clotting studies and D-dimer  were recommended. Doppler ultrasonography was also conducted  which confirmed presence of a clot in the left calf  following which diagnosis of DVT was made.  Treatment: Given the patient’s diagnosis  high-dose anticoagulant therapy was initiated immediately. The patient was initially given a low molecular weight heparin  followed by direct oral anticoagulants  to prevent any clot progression or pulmonary embolism.  Discussion: The patient's elevated BMI  sedentary lifestyle  history of smoking and possible genetic predisposition made him high risk for DVT. Research shows that DVT is more common in males over 60 years of age. Given his hypertension and diabetes  regular follow-up  medication maintenance  and lifestyle modifications were emphasized. Encouragement was given to stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption  as well as maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise routine.  Outcome and follow-up: The patient was discharged after the initial treatment and is now under home-based care with a course of anticoagulation therapy. He has regular follow-up appointments for assessing his health progress and adjusting medications as needed. His efforts towards lifestyle modification and adherence to therapeutic recommendations will be a critical determining factor in his long-term health outcome.   References:  1. Heit JA.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,58,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged African American Female with History of Sedentary Lifestyle and Oral Contraceptive Use: A Case Report  Patient Information: The patient is a 45-year-old African American female presenting to the emergency department (ED) with sudden leg pain and swelling.  Clinical Findings: The patient reported an abrupt onset  unilateral swelling and pain in the right calf area that worsens with standing. No recent immobilization  pregnancy  malignancies  hormone replacement therapy  or genetic predispositions. However  she has been taking oral contraceptives for the last 10 years and maintains a sedentary lifestyle with prolonged sitting due to her desk job.  Timeline: The patient confirmed the pain and swelling emerged acutely within 12 hours preceding her arrival at the hospital. Recognition of the same was delayed due to sleep and the patient failing to consider the significance of her symptoms.  Diagnostic Assessment: Doppler ultrasound revealed an absence of venous flow with signs of wall thickening and intraluminal echo suggest deep vein thrombosis. Routine laboratory testing ruled out infection and other secondary causes of deep vein thrombosis. Screening for thrombophilia was normal.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was administered a low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) injection for anticoagulation and pain management was initiated with acetaminophen. After confirming the absence of contraindications  her oral contraceptive was discontinued  and alternative contraceptive education was provided.  Follow-up and Outcomes: An outpatient treatment approach was adopted  monitoring the patient for improvement of symptoms and potential thrombus resolution. The patient was also advised to incorporate lifestyle modifications such as frequent leg movement and exercise  weight management and the reduction of prolonged sedentary periods.  Patient Perspective: Initially surprised and frightened by her diagnosis  the patient responded well to her treatment  was accepting of the need for lifestyle changes and expressed relief that her condition was manageable.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of identifying deep vein thrombosis in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain  even in the absence of obvious risk factors. Oral contraceptive use combined with a sedentary work environment proved to be a significant risk factor in this patient  emphasizing the need for comprehensive patient histories and the importance of lifestyle modification discussion. Healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis in patients with similar presentations and backgrounds to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,59,Title: A Case Report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in an Overweight Male Subject  Patient Presentation  Mr. James  a 44-year-old African American male with a BMI of 32.5  presented to the emergency department complaining of a three-day history of severe  unilateral swelling and pain in his left lower limb. The patient rated his pain at an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. He denied any recent trauma  surgeries  or history of similar episodes in the past. The patient is a smoker and occasionally indulges in alcohol. He leads an essentially sedentary lifestyle and works a desk job.   Past Medical History   His past medical history was significant for hypertension  well controlled with Lisinopril (10mg daily)  and hypercholesterolemia  for which he is on Atorvastatin (20mg every day). He has a family history of cardiovascular events with father experiencing a myocardial infarction in his late fifties and mother having a stroke at an age of 68 years. Patient has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the left lower limb was significantly swollen and warm to touch compared to the right. The skin was erythematous over the calf muscle. Patient experienced pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (a positive Homan’s sign). No varicosities were noted  and pulses were palpable bilaterally. Abdominal  cardiovascular  and respiratory examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations  A Doppler ultrasound of the affected limb revealed a non-compressible femoral vein  hence supporting the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient subsequently underwent a D-dimer test  which confirmed high levels  therefore  supporting the diagnostic hypothesis.   Management  The patient was administered a weight-based dose of Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparin subcutaneously and was started on oral anticoagulation with Warfarin. Patient was counseled about the importance of elevation of the limb  wearing compression stockings  remaining mobile  and the serious potential risks of untreated DVT  including the development of post-thrombotic syndrome and potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism.  In order to address certain contributing lifestyle factors  the patient was also advised to cease smoking  limit alcohol consumption  maintain a healthy diet  and integrate more mobility and physical activity into his daily routine. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor INR and adjust the warfarin dosage.  Conclusion  This case underlines the need for high clinical suspicion of DVT in patients who present with unilateral lower limb pain and swelling  especially in those with risk factors such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  and smoking.   Early recognition  prompt diagnosis  and immediate management along with lifestyle modifications can improve patients' prognosis and can prevent life-threatening complications like pulmonary embolism and significantly reduce recurrent events.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,60,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Postoperative Octogenarian Female  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) frequently appears in the postoperative period due to prolonged immobility  blood vessel injury  or hypercoagulable state  known collectively as Virchow's triad. The case discussed below delineates the clinical course of DVT in an octogenarian female following elective knee replacement surgery.  Case Presentation: Mrs. X  an 82-year-old Caucasian female  a resident of Indianapolis  Indiana  presented with a three-day history of increasing left leg swelling and discomfort. She had undergone elective total knee replacement surgery two weeks prior. The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension  osteoarthritis  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She never smoked but admitted to having one or two glasses of wine a week  and her family history was significant for cardiovascular disease.   On examination  her left lower leg was swollen  warm  and erythematous with tenderness in the calf muscle. Vital signs upon presentation were blood pressure 142/84mmHg  heart rate 88 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Laboratory assessment revealed a D-dimer level of 0.7 µg/mL (normal: >0.5 µg/mL).   Ultrasound imaging of the left lower extremity revealed thrombus in the femoral and popliteal veins  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Risk factors in her case included advanced age  recent major surgery  and potential hypercoagulability as evidenced by elevated D-dimer levels.  Given her risk of bleeding due to age and recent surgery  she was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  and following no adverse bleeding events  transitioned to oral anticoagulation - direct Factor Xa inhibitors. The Risk of bleeding was continually assessed using the HAS-BLED (Hypertension  Abnormal Renal/Liver Function  Stroke  Bleeding History  Labile INR  Elderly  Drugs/Alcohol) score.  Discussion: This case illustrates the development of DVT in an elderly female with multiple risk factors including recent knee surgery  age  and a potential hypercoagulable state. The case also underlines the importance of an integrated risk-based approach to diagnose DVT  weighing the risk of bleeding against the necessity of anticoagulation.  Conclusion: Patients in the postoperative state  especially the elderly  are at an increased risk of developing DVT. An integrated risk-based approach is useful for identifying DVT in a high-risk population  and early diagnosis is vital so that anticoagulant therapy can be started as early as possible. Anticoagulation needs to be carefully monitored to prevent any adverse bleeding events  particularly in the elderly population.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,63,Title: Case Report of a 65-year-old Caucasian Male with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction  This report describes a case of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a 65-year-old Caucasian male. DVT occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more deep veins  typically in the lower limbs. This condition can potentially lead to serious complications  leg pain  swelling  and can be life-threatening if a blood clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).  Case Presentation  A 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired accountant  presented to the emergency department with severe left calf pain  which he rated as 7 on a scale of 1-10  and noticeable swelling of the left leg. The patient noted that the pain commenced gradually over a few days and had exacerbated over the past day. He reported no recent travel  surgery  or immobility. He denied any history of chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  or hemoptysis.  Medical History  The patient's past medical history was significant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus – managed with Metformin  Hypertension – controlled with Lisinopril  and Dyslipidemia – treated with Atorvastatin. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father experiencing myocardial infarction in his late 70's. The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He has no known allergies.  Investigation and Findings  Upon physical examination  the left leg was warmer and noticeably swollen compared to the right. The Homan's sign was positive. No ulcers or skin changes were noticed. No palpable cords were observed.  Laboratory findings showed a slightly increased D-dimer at 0.6 μg/mL FEU (normal range is <0.5 μg/mL). Other laboratory findings  including Complete Blood Count  Comprehensive Metabolic Panel  and coagulation profile  were within normal limits.  An ultrasound Doppler scan of his left leg revealed a non-compressible popliteal vein suggestive of DVT. There was echogenic material within the lumen indicating thrombosis.   Management and Outcome  The patient was admitted and initiated on Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) Enoxaparin and oral Anticoagulant Rivaroxaban.  After 7 days on therapy  repeat Doppler ultrasound indicated a decrease in thrombus size and relief of symptoms. He was discharged on Rivaroxaban and advised to take it for at least three months. Anticoagulant therapy will reduce the chances of developing recurrent DVT and complications such as pulmonary embolism.   He was educated about the signs of complication  including sudden onset of chest pain and/or shortness of breath  as well as the need to avoid prolonged immobility. A follow-up appointment to monitor his progress was scheduled.  Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the potential risks and symptoms related to DVT  particularly in patients with comorbid conditions like Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. Encouraging timely medical attention can significantly decrease the rate of complications and enhance the quality of life.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,64,Patient Initial: MJ Age: 68 years Gender: Female Ethnicity: White Country: United States  Presenting Concerns: Patient MJ presented with a 5-day history of progressive swelling and mild pain in her right lower leg. The patient reported no injury or trauma to the area. The patient is not an athlete and her occupation doesn't require prolonged immobility. Her pain and swelling were not associated with redness  fever or any systemic symptoms.   Medical History: MJ is a postmenopausal woman with a history of hormonal replacement therapy 5 years back. She is also hypertensive and obese with BMI of 30. She has been on medication for hypertension for the last 10 years. There is no known family history of thromboembolic disease. She is non-diabetic and she does not smoke or consume alcohol. The patient underwent hip replacement surgery a year ago.  Examination and Findings: On examination  MJ's blood pressure was found to be 140/90 mm Hg. No significant findings on chest and heart examination. Lower extremity examination revealed unilateral non-pitting edema and slight warmth in the calf of her right leg. No visible skin discoloration or venous varicosities were noted.  Diagnostic Assessment: Doppler Ultrasound of the right lower extremity revealed a non-compressible segment suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower calf vein (Distal DVT). Laboratory investigations including complete blood count  liver function tests  kidney function tests were within normal threshold  but D-dimer values were elevated.   Treatment and Follow-Up: MJ was started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin. Later  she was switched to oral anticoagulants. She was advised to wear compression stockings and to elevate her leg when possible to help reduce swelling and pain. She was also informed to keep mobile when possible to improve her blood circulation.   On follow-up after 1 month and 3 months  she reported much improved symptoms and was advised to continue her treatment as per the initial plan. A repeat ultrasound examination revealed the resolution of the thrombus. The anticoagulants were planned to be continued for a total of 6 months.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering DVT in post-menopausal patients  with history of hormonal replacement therapy or major surgery  even in the absence of familial thrombotic history. The patient responded well to the anticoagulant therapy and lifestyle changes  contributing to a positive prognosis. Regular follow-ups and repeated imaging helped ensure the timely resolution of the thrombus.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,65,Case Report: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 67-Year-Old Caucasian Female  Abstract:  We report a rare case of an elderly Caucasian woman who presented with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She suffers from a history of hypertension and has long periods of immobilization due to her job as a receptionist. The mainstay therapy of anticoagulant medications was initiated to treat her condition.  Case Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of progressive pain and swelling in her right lower extremity. The patient also reported a sense of heaviness in the affected leg. She is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and has a medical history of hypertension for the past ten years. She lives alone and is currently working as a receptionist where she spends many hours a day sitting  contributing to her sedentary lifestyle. The patient denied any history of surgery  trauma  malignancy  or genetic coagulation disorders. There is no known family history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.   On examination  her right calf was tender  edematous  and warm to touch compared to the left. The circumference of the right calf was also noticeably larger than the left one. Her vital signs were stable  with a blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg and a pulse rate of 85 beats per minute.   Investigations:  Laboratory tests revealed D-Dimer levels significantly raised to 1300 ng/ml (normal <500 ng/ml). Her renal function test  liver function test  and complete blood counts were within normal limits. Ultrasound Doppler of the right lower limb revealed thrombosis in the femoral and popliteal veins consistent with acute deep vein thrombosis.   Treatment/Outcome:  The patient was immediately started on a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and was hospitalized for close monitoring. Subsequent oral anticoagulant therapy (Warfarin) was initiated with an INR target of 2.5 (range 2.0 to 3.0). On follow-up after 3 months  the patient reported a significant reduction in the symptoms  and an ultrasound confirmed the resolution of the thrombus.   Discussion:  The presented case reiterates that advanced age  hypertension  and prolonged immobilization constitute significant risk factors for developing deep vein thrombosis. It underscores the importance of early recognition and management of this potentially life-threatening condition. Early initiation of anticoagulant therapy plays a pivotal role in preventing fatal complications including pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion:  This case report serves as a reminder to clinicians of the risk factors associated with DVT and the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Healthcare practitioners should encourage elderly and sedentary individuals to incorporate routine physical activity into their lifestyle to reduce their risk of DVT.

He was diagnosed 15 years ago and has been on Metformin (500mg twice daily) and Losartan (50mg every morning). He also has a family history of early cardiac disease; his father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 64. He had an open hernia repair ten years ago. There is no history of cancer  Hashimoto's disease  or autoimmune illnesses.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of increasing left calf pain  redness  swelling  and warmth. There was no history of trauma or recent prolonged immobility. He also denied any associated chest pain  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis.   He denied experiencing any loss of consciousness  headache or recent sick contacts. His BMI on examination was 30 kg/m2  and his blood pressure was elevated at 170/90 mmHg  but was otherwise clinically stable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was made based on clinical signs and symptoms  confirmed through Duplex ultrasonography  which revealed an incompressible segment in the left popliteal vein. D-dimer levels were also elevated at 700 ng/mL (normal up to 500 ng/mL).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the medical ward. He was started on subcutaneous Enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin) along with his usual medication  and hypertension was managed with increased Losartan dosage. Compression stockings were prescribed  and he was advised to elevate the affected limb to help reduce swelling.  Follow-up and Outcomes: On a follow-up consultation after two weeks  the patient has reported relief from pain. Swelling and redness of left calf had significantly reduced. He is continued on his oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban. Hyperglycemia and Hypertension is managed with medication.  Key Learning Points: This case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in the differential diagnosis  especially in patients presenting with calf pain  swelling  and changes in skin color. Risk factors in this case include advanced age  history of hypertension  diabetes  obesity  and a sedentary lifestyle due to retirement.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,67,Title: A Case Report on Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Female Patient   Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a significant healthcare issue worldwide. It pertains to the formation of blood clots  typically in deep veins found in lower limbs. If inadequately addressed  the disease can become life-threatening due to complications like pulmonary embolism (PE). Despite the high prevalence of this disease  it often remains under-diagnosed. This report presents a case of DVT in a 68-year-old post-menopausal Caucasian female.  Case Presentation: The patient  a retired social worker  came with complaints of excessive swelling and sustained pain in her left calf for a week. She had a history of varicose veins and had been inactive due to recent hip surgery. Additionally  she had obesity (BMI 33)  non-insulin-dependent diabetes  and managed her hypertension with medication. She had quit smoking 10 years ago and consumed alcohol moderately. There was no familial history of blood clot disorders.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed warmth and reddish discoloration in the affected leg  indicative of superficial thrombophlebitis. But the patient's pain intensity and progression  along with her medical conditions  raised suspicions of DVT. The patient also had mild shortness of breath but no chest pain or other symptoms of PE.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Laboratory examination showed elevated D-dimer levels. Doppler Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein  validating the diagnosis of DVT. The patient's Wells score was 3 points  indicating moderate risk.  Therapeutic Focus and Results: The patient was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Upon stabilization  she was switched to oral Rivaroxaban for at least three months. Her symptoms improved significantly over the course of a week  and follow-ups were planned to check for comorbidities and bleeding complications. The patient was also advised on lifestyle modifications  including weight loss  activity enhancement along with the use of graduated compression stockings.  Conclusion: This report shines a light on a woman at moderate risk of DVT due to several individual risk factors including obesity  surgery  and varicose veins. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in such cases  with prompt and suitable management hugely impacting patient outcomes. Despite the ubiquitous use of risk assessment tools like the Wells score  diagnosis of DVT based solely on clinical suspicion can significantly prevent morbidity and mortality.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,68,Title: A Case Report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female with No Previous Medical History  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition that involves the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins  typically in the legs. This case report will focus on a patient who was diagnosed with DVT despite having no significant past medical history pointing to a risk of DVT.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic female who presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden-onset acute pain and swelling in her left lower extremity. The patient disclosed that there’s no history of injury  recent travel  bed rest  surgery  or immobilization in the past month. She denied any history of smoking or alcoholism. The patient had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.1 kg/m2  suggesting obesity. Her family history was significant for heart disease in her father.   The patient was afebrile and vital signs were within normal limits. On examination  the left lower extremity was markedly swollen  warm to touch  and tender  suggesting inflammation and edema. No signs of superficial venous inflammation were seen. The rest of her physical exam  including her cardiovascular and respiratory examination  was unremarkable.  Investigations: A venous Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity was performed  which identified a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT.  Over the course of the hospital stay  she underwent a series of laboratory investigations  including D-Dimer  complete blood count (CBC)  coagulation profile  lipid profile  and a thrombophilia screen  including tests for Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin gene mutation. The results only highlighted a high D-Dimer value and a slightly elevated LDL cholesterol level. Genetic testing did not point to any hereditary thrombophilia.  Management and Outcome: The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban  and analgesia was provided for pain relief. Swelling and pain in the left leg gradually subsided over a week. She was counseled about the lifestyle modifications necessary in obesity and discharged with the advice to follow up in an outpatient department. On subsequent follow-up visits  the patient adhered to medication  and there was no extension or recurrence of DVT.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes that DVT can occur even in patients with no previous medical history suggestive of a risk for DVT. It also highlights the importance of considering DVT as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute onset lower limb swelling and pain and the role of obesity as a risk factor.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,69,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Female With Past Medical History of Obesity and Prolonged Immobility: A Case Report  Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins  predominantly in the lower limbs. Risk factors for the development of DVT include prolonged immobility  surgery  obesity  history of venous thromboembolism  among others. We present an interesting case of DVT in a 56-year-old woman with a history of obesity and prolonged bedrest.  Case Description:  Patient Information: The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian woman residing in Midwest USA  who works as an office-manager  a mostly sedentary occupation. No known allergies were reported. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Clinical Findings: She presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of painful swelling in her left lower limb. Physical examination revealed a swollen  erythematous left calf  which was warm to touch and tender on deep palpation. There were no signs of superficial vein inflammation.   Diagnostic Assessment: A spectrum of tests were performed  including complete blood count  coagulation profile  and D-dimer test  which came back elevated  raising suspicion for DVT. Confirmatory diagnosis was established with a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound  which showed a non-compressible left popliteal vein.  Therapeutic Intervention: Anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was promptly introduced. After initial treatment  oral anticoagulation with Warfarin was started alongside LMWH  and the latter was discontinued once a stable international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3 was achieved.  Follow-Up: The patient was advised to lose weight  encouraged to mobilize  and increase physical activity. Elastic compression stockings were recommended for leg edema. Follow-ups at the anticoagulation clinic are ongoing for INR monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment.  Past Medical History: Notably  the patient has a past medical history of obesity with a body mass index of 35 kg/m2 and had been immobile for several weeks due to a fractured ankle. She has no known history of thrombophilic disorders or previous venous thromboembolism.   Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing DVT as a possible diagnosis in patients with calf pain and swelling  particularly in the presence of risk factors like obesity and prolonged immobility as seen in our patient. Prompt diagnosis using a combination of D-dimer testing and Doppler imaging  followed by immediate initiation of anticoagulation therapy  is crucial to prevent fatal complications.  The patient’s occupation as an office manager  which involves prolonged sitting periods  also might have contributed to her risk of developing DVT. Highlighting the need for preventive strategies like regular movement and lifestyle modifications in a similar at-risk population.  Conclusion:  The case serves as a reminder for physicians to consider deep vein thrombosis in differential diagnosis in patients with unremitting leg pain and swelling  especially when they have significant predisposing risk factors. Early detection and initiation of appropriate treatment are vital in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,70,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Presenting a case of a 52-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) but with no significant medical history. The purpose of this report is to highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis and management even in individuals with low risk factors.  Patient Information: Mr. X  a 52-year-old Caucasian male  presented with a three-day history of increasing right calf pain and leg swelling. He denied any recent periods of immobility  surgery  or trauma. He does not smoke or consume alcohol.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient's right calf was noticeably swollen in comparison to the left. He had a positive Homan's sign and the area was tender to touch. His vital signs were stable: blood pressure 135/80 mmHg  heart rate 78 beats/min  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  temperature 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.   His body mass index was 27.1 kg/m2  rendering him slightly overweight. His breathing was regular with no abnormal sounds  heart sounds were dual and rhythmic  and abdomen was soft with no organomegaly.   Diagnostic Assessment: The patient underwent a D-dimer test which came back significantly high at 700 ng/mL (normal range: 0-500 ng/mL)  prompting a suspicion of DVT. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a Duplex ultrasonography that demonstrated a non-compressible femoral and popliteal vein in the right leg  indicating a significant clot.   Standard coagulation test results were all within normal range and thrombophilia screen was negative. A basic metabolic panel and lipid profile were recorded showing slight deviation in LDL and HDL ratios.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  Enoxaparin 1mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours along with a Rivaroxaban 15mg orally twice daily. His symptoms started to alleviate after three days of therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Two weeks later  the patient reported a significant reduction in swelling and pain. Subsequent ultrasound showed a reduced clot burden  indicating positive response to treatment. After one month  the patient was switched to Rivaroxaban monotherapy  20mg orally once daily for long term therapy.  Conclusions: This case emphasizes that DVT should be considered in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling  even in those without traditional risk factors. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of anticoagulation therapy are crucial in preventing further complications including pulmonary embolism. Patients presenting with similar symptoms should be thoroughly investigated for DVT to improve the outcome of this potentially lethal condition.

Its purpose is to stimulate discussion around critical diagnostic considerations in this population.  Case Presentation The patient was a 67-year-old Hispanic female who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of unilateral right leg pain and swelling  which had persisted for two days without trauma. The patient described the pain as """"severe  dull and aching"""" adding that it was somewhat relieved when she elevated her leg. She rated her pain intensity as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. She reported no fever  chest pain  dyspnea  cough  or hemoptysis but divulged that she had been sedentary for a few weeks due to Covid-19 confinement measures.  The patient lived with her husband and two children. She was retired but had previously worked as a school teacher. She had a known history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension - both were treated with medications for over ten years. She has no known allergies. There was no known family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  pulmonary embolism (PE)  or inherited thrombophilias. The patient did not smoke and consumed alcohol moderately.  Assessment Physical examination revealed that the affected right leg was edematous extending from the calf to the ankle  warmer compared to the left leg  and slightly erythematous. Pulses were palpable bilaterally and symmetric  without noticeable temperature difference between legs. No visible superficial veins were noted.  Investigation The d-dimer test was significantly elevated. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the right femoral vein. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Hematologic tests showed elevated hemoglobin A1C and Coagulation tests were within normal limits.  Management After diagnosis  the patient was started on Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) and switched to oral Rivaroxaban after 5 days. Concomitant use of Aspirin was ceased. The patient was educated about the importance of ambulation  leg elevation  regular monitoring  diet control for diabetes  and her newly started medication.  Outcome and Follow-up Two weeks post-discharge  a follow-up visit revealed substantial improvement in her symptoms. The patient was regularly compliant with medications and showed increased physical activity. The monitoring test revealed the prothrombin time within the normal range.  Discussion In this case  the patient's sedentary lifestyle due to pandemic restrictions  age  diabetes  and hypertension are potential risk factors for DVT. This case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain  even in populations where DVT is less common.  Learning points - Abnormal leg swelling should trigger the suspicion of DVT in older patients with underlying risk factors. - Diversified management of the condition is crucial  encompassing pharmacotherapy  patient education  and adoption of a healthier lifestyle. - Hispanic patient populations may underreport conditions such as DVT; therefore  a high index of suspicion and detailed investigation is central.  Acknowledgment: The patient and family gave informed consent for this case to be published."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,76,Title: A Case Report on a 65-year-old Caucasian Female with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian woman presently residing in a rural part of Alabama. She is a retired school teacher  a widow with four grown-up children. The patient lives on her own  though her children visit her frequently. She has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 27.3 kg/m2  indicating overweight.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are currently controlled under medical management (Lisinopril 20 mg/daily and Simvastatin 40 mg/daily respectively). She does not have a history of diabetes  lung  or heart disease. She had a remote history of left total knee arthroplasty performed five years ago.  Presenting complains: The patient presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of left calf pain and noticeable swelling  which has progressively worsened over the last 48 hours. The pain is constant  severe  and increases with ambulation. There is no history of trauma or injury. The patient has been sedentary recently due to a broken arm  which required casting four weeks prior.   Clinical Examination and Investigation: Upon examination  her left calf was tender  erythematous  and showed pitting edema. Her vital signs were stable. No palpable cords or noticeable skin changes were present.   The patient was subjected to compression ultrasonography and a D-dimer test  which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in her left popliteal vein indicative of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Her Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) score was zero  reflecting a low risk for early mortality from Pulmonary Embolism (PE). However  the patient was further evaluated to rule out PE given her recent history of immobility.  Treatment: The patient was administered low molecular weight heparin for immediate anticoagulation. She was prescribed Rivaroxaban [a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)]  for long-term management. She was also advised to buy graduated compression stockings.   Follow up: Follow-ups were scheduled for review and to monitor for any adverse events related to the therapy. Necessary lifestyle modifications like low-fat diet  moderate exercise  and avoidance of prolonged immobility were reinforced.   This case emphasizes the importance of a high index of suspicion for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral lower extremity swelling and recent history of immobilization  even in the absence of major risk factors. Early detection and appropriate anticoagulation are pivotal in preventing life-threatening sequelae such as PE.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,77,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in one or more deep veins  typically in the legs. It often results from long periods of inactivity and could lead to severe conditions like pulmonary embolism if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Demographic factors such as age  gender  and ethnicity have been identified as significant risk factors for DVT.  Patient Information: A 54-year-old Hispanic female  teacher by profession  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of swelling and tenderness in her left lower leg  a month after undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy. The patient had a past medical history of obesity  hypertension  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The patient reported no known allergies. She does not smoke nor drink alcohol. She is married and has two children.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed that the patient's left leg was warm  reddish  and visibly swollen in comparison to the right leg. Pain was exacerbated upon palpation or flexion of the foot. Vital signs were stable  and no discernible shortness of breath or chest pain was observed.   Diagnostic Assessment: The possibility of DVT was considered based on clinical manifestations. Patient underwent Doppler ultrasonography which revealed a non-compressible left popliteal vein consistent with a deep vein thrombus. CBC showed slight elevation in WBC count. D-dimer levels were elevated to 950ng/mL.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initiated on low molecular weight heparin therapy with close monitoring of her CBC and coagulation profile. After demonstrating therapeutic range and achieving clinical stability  she was transitioned onto oral anticoagulant therapy with Warfarin for a planned duration of three months. The patient was also fitted with compression socks and advised on physical activity to promote blood circulation.  Follow Up and Outcomes: At the one-month and three-month follow-up  the patient reported decreased pain and reduction in swelling. Repeat Doppler ultrasound at three months revealed resolution of the DVT. Blood work at monthly intervals were within normal limits  including INR under anticoagulant therapy.   Conclusion: This case illustrates that post-operative states and underlying medical conditions heighten the risk for DVT. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Hispanic ethnicity is presently under recognized and under researched in terms of the prevalence of DVT  thus necessitating a need for further studies. This case should be beneficial in promoting awareness about the potential for DVT in Hispanic populations.

Vital signs were stable along with a slightly elevated heart rate (100 bpm). There was no evidence of superficial venous varicosities.  Diagnostic Assessment: Doppler Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal vein. D-Dimer levels were significantly elevated. Renal  liver  and thyroid function tests were within normal ranges. Given her history  EKG and Chest X-ray were done which showed no immediate concern.  Therapeutic Intervention: Patient was managed acutely with subcutaneous Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparin (LMWH) and later transitioned to oral anticoagulation with Apixaban. Lifestyle and diet modifications were advocated.  Outcomes: The patient showed marked improvement with resolution of pain and swelling over a period of one week. She was advised to continue the oral anticoagulation therapy for 3 months and seek medical assistance if symptoms reappear or get worse.  Discussion: This case highlights the increased risk of DVT in elderly  obese women paired with history of smoking and early menopause. DVT risk remains elevated in post-menopausal women  especially those taking hormone replacement therapy. While the patient’s known history of hypertension wasn't a direct factor for DVT  it could have contributed to overall cardiovascular risk.   Patient Consent: Obtained  This single case report represents a typical scenario for deep vein thrombosis in an elderly woman  with co-morbid conditions being contributing factors. Further research into preventative measures for such high-risk individuals is advised.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,80,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 50-Year-Old Caucasian Female Patient with No Prior Cardiac Disease: A Case Report  Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe condition characterized by blood clot formation in the deep veins  often in the lower extremities. It may lead to serious repercussions like pulmonary embolism if left untreated. This report presents a case of a 50-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with DVT in the absence of any prior cardiovascular diseases.  Case Presentation:   The patient  a 50-year-old Caucasian female with body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m² (overweight)  presented to the emergency department  reporting progressive swelling and tenderness in her left lower limb for the past three days. She complained of accompanying pain  warmth  and a mild discoloration of the affected area. The patient led a sedentary lifestyle and was a social drinker  consuming an average of two alcoholic drinks per day. She had tried over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications with no relief prior to her visit. Her medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes and borderline hypertension  managed with oral antidiabetic drugs and lifestyle modifications.  Physical examination revealed unilateral edema  erythema  and localized tenderness in the left lower limb  suspicious of DVT. There were no palpable cord signs or superficial venous patterns observed. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable  with a normal heart rhythm.   On further investigation  the patient's D-dimer levels were significantly raised (680 ng/ML). Color Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed obstructive thrombosis in the left femoral and popliteal veins  indicative of DVT. The patient’s renal function test  liver function test  and lipid profile were within normal limits  excluding other thrombogenic factors.   Management and Follow Up:   The patient was immediately started on therapeutic heparin bridged to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy with in-house monitoring of her prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) to adjust the dosage. She was educated about DVT  physical activity  leg elevation  and consistent use of compression stockings were advised.   On the 3-month follow-up visit  the patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. The Doppler ultrasonography revealed partial recanalization of the involved veins with residual clot.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the necessity of considering DVT in patients presenting with unexplained lower limb pain and swelling  even in the absence of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing complications like pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,81,Title: A Case Report of Idiopathic Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Young Male Patient  Patient Information:   The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history or familial predisposition known for thromboembolic afflictions. His body mass index (BMI) falls within the normal range  at 22.3  and he leads an active lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet. The patient does not smoke and has minimal alcohol intake. He is active in the professional field and spends about 6-8 hours daily in a sedentary position due to his job.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented with sudden onset of pain  swelling  and redness in his left leg  more noticeably in the calf region  for two days. He denied any recent trauma  prolonged immobility  recent surgery  medication use  or travel history which could have predisposed him to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient was vitally stable. His left lower leg appeared visibly swollen and was warm to touch with mild tenderness on deep palpation. Homans' sign was positive  increasing the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Duplex ultrasonography showed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein suggestive of a thrombus  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Coagulation screen including prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  thrombin time  and fibrinogen were within the normal range. Factor V Leiden mutation and Prothrombin gene mutation tests were negative. Tests for antiphospholipid antibodies were also negative.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on daily low molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban. Over the course of a week  the swelling and pain in the patient's leg began to reduce significantly.  Follow Up:  The patient was advised to follow-up after two weeks for a re-assessment. On the follow-up consultation  ultrasonography showed a reduction in thrombus size. He continued the oral rivaroxaban therapy.  Discussion:  This case is presented because of its nature as idiopathic DVT in a young male  which is relatively rare and is often associated with known risk factors such as immobilization  recent surgery  trauma  malignancy  and genetic predisposition. The absence of such risk factors in the present case is intriguing. The possibility of an undiagnosed underlying malignancy or hematological disorder was considered  but investigations did not reveal any hidden conditions. This suggests that DVT may occur without recognizable predisposing risk factors in the young.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,82,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Postmenopausal Female: A Case Report  Introduction  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a vascular disorder characterized by the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein  predominantly in the leg veins. This condition can lead to serious complications if left untreated  potentially resulting in a pulmonary embolism (PE).  Case Presentation  Patient Information  A 65-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the emergency department with a 2-day history of progressive left lower leg pain and swelling. The patient lives in urban Minnesota  is a widow  retired from teaching  and lives alone. She is a nonsmoker and bisectual  and she reported no alcohol or illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings  Physical examination of the swollen leg revealed it was warm to touch and bluish-red in color. Palpation caused severe pain. She had a body mass index (BMI) of 28.2 kg/m2  heart rate 90 bpm  blood pressure 135/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and normal body temperature.  Medical history  The patient had no history of DVT or PE. She was postmenopausal and had last taken Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) 5 years ago. Her medical history also included hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  all of which were well-controlled with medication. She additionally had a long-standing history of varicose veins.   Laboratory Findings  Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT scan) confirmed left leg DVT. Her hypercoagulability workup was positive. All cultures were negative excluding sepsis  and her kidney and liver functions were within normal range.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was treated with intravenous heparin for five days and oral anticoagulant (warfarin) therapy was initiated. She was kept under watch for signs of PE and provided with compression stockings for the affected leg.  Outcome and Follow-Up  Her leg swelling gradually reduced over a week  and she responded positively to the treatment. She was discharged with oral anticoagulant therapy and was advised to regularly follow-up in the outpatient clinic to monitor her INR.   Discussion  This case report emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in postmenopause female patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially with various risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and varicose veins. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can effectively reduce complications  emphasizing the importance of patient vigilance and regular follow-ups.  Conclusions  This case reinforces the fact that DVT can occur in individuals with multiple risk factors even in the absence of a history of venous thromboembolism. Healthcare providers must consider a systemic approach and detailed investigations in at-risk populations to forestall complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,83,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female with a History of Mandatory Immobility: A Case Report   Introduction:  This case report details the presentation  diagnosis  management  and outcome of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a 50-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for prolonged immobilization.  Case presentation:  A 50-year-old Caucasian female  recently immobilized due to a fractured right femur presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of right calf pain and swelling. She is a non-smoker  does not drink alcohol has  no family history of venous thromboembolism  and is socioeconomic middle-class. Her BMI recorded as 26.  The patient had undergone intramedullary nailing for her femur fracture four weeks prior. Postoperatively she was prescribed low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as DVT prophylaxis which she took for 10 days. According to patient's statement  for the last three weeks  she was mostly confined to a wheelchair with limited physical activity and did not continue any anticoagulant therapy.   Clinical findings:  Physical examinations revealed that her right lower leg was erythematous  swollen  and slightly warmer compared with the left leg. There was mild pain during palpation and dorsiflexion of her right foot (positive Homan's sign).  Diagnostic assessment:  A color Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was performed  revealing acute thrombus in the femoral and popliteal veins  indicative of DVT. Her D-dimer levels were significantly elevated at 1.2 μg/ml (normal range <0.5 μg/ml).   Therapeutic intervention:  She was initiated on intravenous unfractionated heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation therapy. Demobilization of the leg was advised except for the physiotherapy sessions.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  During follow-up appointments over the next three months  her pain and swelling gradually receded. An ultrasound scan after three months showed recanalization of the femoral and popliteal veins.  Discussion:  Distinct factors in this case include a fracture of the right femur leading to post-operative immobilization and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. These events converged to enhance the risk of DVT. This patient's history underscores the importance of proper DVT prophylaxis following orthopedic surgeries and during prolonged immobility.  Conclusion:  While DVT is more frequently observed in hospitalized and bedridden patients  instances in the general population like in this case underline the danger it poses to even those outside of immediate hospital care. Extended anticoagulation prophylaxis and increased physical activity post femur fracture surgery are crucial for reducing DVT risk.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,86,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins  most often in the legs. Complications include pulmonary embolism when the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs. The risk factors include advanced age  obesity  surgery  immobility  smoking  and a history of venous thromboembolism or cancer.  Patient Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to the clinic with a one-week history of swelling  discomfort  and redness in her left lower limb. She is a widow  a retired schoolteacher  residing in a suburban neighborhood. She denies any use of tobacco or alcohol  but has a body mass index (BMI) of 29 signifying borderline obesity.   Clinical Findings: The patient reported a pulling sensation in the swollen limb making movement arduous. The leg did not have any visible injuries but did feel warm to touch. She reported no recent injuries or traumas. Ultrasonography confirmed a clot in the left lower leg's deep vein  leading to a diagnosis of DVT.  Timeline: Her symptoms gradually worsened for about a week before seeking medical attention. Prior to this encounter  her last medical consultation was 6 months ago for routine check-ups as a diabetic patient.  Diagnostic Assessment: Complete blood counts were generally within normal ranges. The D-dimer test was positive  a finding common in patients with DVT. Ultrasonography showed a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Given her history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  an HbA1c test was also conducted revealing relatively controlled levels at 7.0%.  Therapeutic Intervention: In mild cases  medication such as anticoagulants is suggested. However  given her advanced age  comorbidity  and obesity  in addition to medication  she was also advised for a brief hospital stay for close clinical monitoring. Low molecular weight Heparin  followed by oral anticoagulants for an extended period  was prescribed.  Follow Up and Outcome: After a week  the patient noticed significant reduction in swelling and discomfort in her leg. Upon evaluation after two weeks  the clot showed substantial resolution on repeat ultrasonography. She is still under observation and continuing her medication regimen.  Patient Perspective: She expressed gratitude for the swift diagnosis and effective treatment. The patient was initially worried about possible complications  however  frequent consultation and thorough explanation by her healthcare provider gave her confidence.

The patient presented with a one-week history of progressive swelling  discomfort and redness located in her left lower extremity. She reported no recent injury  surgery  prolonged travel  or immobilization. There was no history of oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy. She denied any complaints of chest pain  difficulty breathing  or hemoptysis.  On examination  her left calf was significantly swollen and tender  hot to touch  compared to the right. Her vitals were stable with a blood pressure of 135/82 mmHg and a resting heart rate of 78 bpm.   Investigations & Diagnosis: A venous duplex ultrasound of her left leg confirmed the presence of a non-compressible segment in the left femoral and popliteal veins indicative of a DVT. Her D-dimer levels were markedly elevated.   Treatment: She was immediately initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) and was transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban) after a stabilizing period.  Outcome and Follow-up: She was discharged home after five days of hospitalization. At the one-month follow-up appointment  the patient reported significant symptom relief and repeat ultrasound showed significant reduction in the size of the thrombus.   Discussion: This case adds to the existing literature as it broadly represents DVT patients - middle-aged individuals with potential risk factors (hypertension and sedentary profession). No typical risk factors like recent surgery  pregnancy  malignancy  or genetic predisposition were found. This case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in any patient presenting with unexplained leg pain and swelling despite a lack of typical risk factors. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,90,"Title: A Case Report of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Woman With No Significant Previous Medical History  Introduction:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) refers to the formation of one or more blood clots in the deep veins of the body  usually in the legs. While the condition can affect anyone  DVT is more commonly found in adults over the age of 60. However  DVT cases have been increasingly diagnosed in younger adults as well.   Case Report:  The patient  Mrs. E.O.  is a 56-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant past medical history. She resides in rural Kentucky and is a lifelong non-smoker. Her BMI falls within the normal range (22.3 kg/m2). The patient is physically active  with no history of recreational drug use or regular alcohol consumption.  Mrs. E.O. presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressive left lower leg pain and swelling that started suddenly over the course of a day. Her symptoms were associated with mild redness but no skin temperature elevation  wound  recent injury  or prolonged immobilization.   Physical examination revealed mild erythema and swelling predominantly in the left leg compared to the right. The patient yielded positive results on the Homan's sign.   Investigation:  Considering her symptoms and physical findings  a venous Doppler ultrasound was requested immediately. It confirmed the presence of an acute deep vein thrombosis involving the left popliteal and femoral veins. Her D-dimer levels were significantly elevated.   No significant abnormalities were found in complete blood count  liver and renal function tests. Testing for inherited thrombophilia came back as negative. ECG and chest X-ray were within normal limits.  Management:  Mrs. E.O. was hospitalized and started on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin) and oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban). There was a noticeable improvement in her symptoms over the course of her hospital stay.  Discussion:  Surprisingly  our patient did not possess any traditional risk factors of DVT such as advanced age  obesity  smoking  or thrombophilia. She was physically active and her medical history was unremarkable. However  her case highlights the reality that DVT can occur in individuals outside of the traditionally perceived high-risk demographics.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  our patient's case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis  even in patients who don't fit within the traditional risk factor framework. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can significantly reduce morbidity associated with this condition. Further research is needed to better understand these """"outlier"""" cases of DVT. "

He lives in a semi-rural area in the Midwestern United States with his wife. His primary language is English  and he completed high school education. The patient is fairly sedentary with occasional walks in the neighborhood. He is regularly followed-up for his chronic conditions and maintains good compliance with his medication regimen.  Clinical Findings   The patient presented to the emergency department with pain and swelling in his left lower leg that began approximately 24 hours ago. He reported that he felt a small cramp but did not have any visible injuries. Later  the leg became painful  swollen  and noticeably warmer. There was no complaint of chest pain or breathlessness.   Medical History  The patient has a previous medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago. He suffered a stroke two years ago with minimal residual deficit. He is currently taking Losartan for hypertension  Metformin for diabetes  and Aspirin and Atorvastatin as secondary stroke prophylaxis. He has no known drug allergies.  Physical Examination  The patient’s vital signs were stable. On examination  the left leg appeared swollen  red  and warm compared to the right leg. Distinctive discoloration below the knee was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable but diminished in the left leg.  Differential Diagnosis  The patient's symptoms suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However  the differential diagnoses also included cellulitis  acute compartment syndrome  superficial thrombophlebitis  and Baker's cyst.  Investigations  A Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity revealed a lack of compressibility of the femoral and popliteal veins  supporting the diagnosis of DVT. Routine laboratory investigations showed slightly elevated inflammatory markers. D-dimer concentration was significantly elevated.  Treatment  The patient was admitted and started on therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight Heparin (LMWH) promptly. He had no complications from anticoagulation. Further management involved transitioning the patient to oral anticoagulants for long-term treatment. We also initiated compression therapy and leg elevation to reduce swelling and pain in the affected leg.  Outcome and follow-up  Over the following week  the patient’s leg swelling and pain decreased significantly. He was educated about the signs of pulmonary embolism and was instructed to return promptly if he noticed symptoms such as sudden shortness of breath or chest pain.   His condition will be reviewed in the outpatient clinic after 1 month and then every 3 months or earlier if necessary. If re-thrombosis or recurrent symptoms occur earlier or bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy  he would be re-evaluated for other potential risk factors for thrombosis  and treatment would be adjusted accordingly.  Informed Consent  Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Patient Perspective  The patient reported being satisfied with the care provided and felt comfortable in his follow-up plan.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,93,Title: 'A Case Report of a Recurrent Unilateral Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 52-year-old African American Female with a History of Smoking and Obesity’  Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common yet serious medical condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein  typically in the lower legs  thigh  or pelvis. We report a case of a recurrent unilateral DVT in a 52-year-old African American female with a history of obesity and smoking.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 52-year-old African American woman working as an office manager living in the urban area of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. She is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history but had quit 10 years prior. She has a high BMI (Body Mass Index) at 35 kg/m2  indicating class II obesity. She also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with inconsistent medication adherence due to medical cost concerns.  The patient initially presented with symptoms of swelling  intense pain  and warmth in her left leg. She reported a previous incident of DVT in the same leg approximately five years ago  after a prolonged period of immobilization following a minor car accident. At that time  the patient was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation for six months. Family medical history was significant only for type-2 diabetes mellitus in her mother  and no history of blood clotting disorders or malignancies.  On physical examination  the patient showed pitting edema in her left lower leg  calf tenderness  and erythema. No specific findings were spotted upon cardiovascular and respiratory examinations. Vital signs were within normal ranges except for slightly elevated blood pressure at 145/95 mmHg. Laboratory data showed a marginally raised D-dimer at 0.65 mg/L (normal <0.5 mg/ L).  Due to the patient's presentation and positive D-dimer test  a Doppler Ultrasound was performed confirming the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein  leading to the diagnosis of recurrent DVT.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the higher risk of DVT recurrence in individuals with obesity and a previous history of DVT. Further studies are required to better understand and manage the complexities of treating recurrent DVT in patients with these risk factors  as well as challenges in ensuring medication adherence due to economic concerns.  The clinical management for this patient centered around re-initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy and close follow-ups to ensure adherence. Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise  a healthier diet  and weight loss were advised to cope with obesity and consequent cardiovascular risks.  Conclusion:  Recurrent DVT is a serious health condition that requires timely diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic interventions to prevent severe complications like pulmonary embolism. Greater attention and resources should be focused on preventive measures  particularly in high-risk populations  and addressing the barriers to consistent medical adherence in socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,94,Title: A Case Report on Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged Hispanic Male  Abstract:   This report describes the case of a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presented with a two-week history of pain and swelling in the left lower limb  indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Highlighted in this report is the importance of considering this diagnosis even in patients without a relevant medical history  or the presence of traditional risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle.   Case Presentation:  The patient  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  employed as an office clerk  with no significant past medical history  presented with progressive pain and swelling in the left lower limb over a span of two weeks. The patient had no history of surgeries  recent long-duration travel  immobility  or family history of thrombotic disorders. The patient was mildly obese with a BMI of 30.2; he had a sedentary lifestyle and a two pack-year history of smoking  but no record of alcohol or illicit drug abuse.  Physical examination revealed warmth  redness  and tenderness in the calf and ankle area of the left leg. The calf circumference was significantly greater compared to the right leg.   Investigation and Management:  An ultrasound Doppler was performed on the symptomatic leg. It revealed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal and posterior tibial veins  confirming a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. D-dimer levels were also significantly elevated. The patient's blood work showed normal levels of white blood cells  platelets  and hemoglobin.  He was initiated on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for immediate anticoagulation and began oral anticoagulant therapy with Rivaroxaban. The patient was advised to elevate the left leg  wear compression stockings  and was educated about the signs of pulmonary embolism.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  After a week of treatment  the patient reported significant relief of pain and reduction in swelling. On assessment  LMWH was discontinued  and Rivaroxaban was continued as per guideline-directed therapy.  This case underscores the importance of considering DVT in differential diagnoses  even in patients without apparent risk factors or prior medical history. It further emphasizes the role of appropriate investigation  risk factor management  and the provision of patient education in managing this condition.  Conclusion:  Despite a lack of significant past medical history  this case of a middle-aged Hispanic male with deep vein thrombosis further supports the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for the condition  given its potential for severe complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment  along with education about symptom recognition and lifestyle modification  can substantially improve patient outcomes. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,95,Title: Diagnosis and Management of Unprovoked Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a Previously Healthy Individual  Patient Demographic:  A 68-year-old non-Hispanic Caucasian male  retired construction worker  resident of Boston  Massachusetts  non-smoker  moderate weekly alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with a 4-day history of increasing pain and swelling in his right leg  particularly the calf area. He denied any recent trauma  prolonged periods of immobility  or long-haul flights. He also reported unexplained fatigue  but no respiratory symptoms or chest pain were reported.  Past Medical History: The patient has hypertension managed with amlodipine. He has had no prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or any hereditary coagulation abnormalities. His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus but no known history of familial clotting disorders. He is not on any anticoagulant medication or taking any form of hormone treatment. He has no known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: Physical examination found the patient to be comfortable at rest  with normal blood pressure and pulse rate. The right leg was warm  erythematous  edematous  and tender on palpation  consistent with the symptoms of DVT. There was no pitting edema  and Homans’ sign was positive. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Laboratory investigations showed a mildly raised D-dimer level. A lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound was carried out  which evidenced extensive thrombosis in the right popliteal vein extending into the trifurcation. A CT pulmonary angiogram was also performed due to the high risk of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) associated with DVT but found no evidence of PE.  Diagnosis:  This patient was diagnosed with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis.  Management and Follow-Up: The patient was admitted for observation and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient was further transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)  apixaban  given his risk profile and absence of PE. The patient also wore a graduated compression stocking on the affected leg. Education was provided on the need for continuous treatment and signs of potential complications such as PE.  The patient was scheduled for close outpatient follow-up including monitoring for potential post-thrombotic syndrome. There was a discussion on the need for risk factor modification including lifestyle changes. Also  further testing for thrombophilia was considered due to the unprovoked nature of the DVT.  This case highlights the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain even without known provocative factors. Unprovoked DVT could potentially signify an underlying thrombophilia which mandates additional investigations and a different level of clinical management. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,96,Title: Management of Deep Vein Thrombosis in an elderly male patient with previous Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Case Presentation  A male patient  aged 70  Caucasian  retired mathematician  non-smoker  presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive swelling  redness  and pain of his right lower leg. On initial sighting  it was noted the patient was overweight with a BMI of 28.  Medical History  The patient had a history of type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years previously  controlled with metformin and a well-managed lifestyle modification program.He also had a history of hypertension managed with a calcium channel blocker  Amlodipine 10mg daily  for the past 5 years. There was no history of malignancy  recent hospitalizations or immobilization  trauma  surgeries  or known coagulation disorders. There was no reported family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. The patient had undergone a complete medical review 6 months earlier  with no significant findings.  Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Assessment  Physical examination revealed an erythematous  swollen  warm  and painful lower right extremity. The Homans sign was positive. The patient's blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg  pulse rate 88 bpm  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  fever was absent  and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Laboratory tests  including complete blood count  coagulation profile  and metabolic panel were within normal ranges  except for an elevated D-dimer level at 750 ng/mL FEU(normal is 0-500 ng/mL FEU).  A lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the right popliteal vein  diagnostic of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) and oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin. The dosage of enoxaparin was 1mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours and warfarin was initiated at a dose of 5mg daily.   Follow-Up and Outcomes   Upon 48 hours  the patient showed substantial improvement with a decrease in limb swelling and pain. Serial monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio(INR) was started to maintain a therapeutic range between 2-3. The patient was counseled regarding the importance of adherence to medication  risks and signs of bleeding. A follow-up Doppler was planned at one  three  and six months.   Conclusion  This case illustrates the need for high clinical suspicion for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral lower limb swelling and pain  especially in those with previous comorbidities. Early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation therapy are crucial in preventing serious complications such as Pulmonary Embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,7,97,Title: Management of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Obese Female: A Case Report   Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a potentially life-threatening acute vascular disease characterized by formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body  typically in the legs. This case describes the management of DVT in a 55-year-old  Caucasian female.  Patient Information: The patient  a 55-year-old  Caucasian female presented to the outpatient vascular clinic with a history of severe pain and swelling in her right lower extremity for two weeks. The patient's demographic information includes a residential address in rural northern Michigan and employment as a cashier. The patient mentioned recent prolonged immobilization due to a fractured left ankle 3 months ago. She denied any history of recent long travel  surgery  or malignancy.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient's right lower leg was found to be warmer  swollen  and erythematous  with significant tenderness on deep palpation. She had a body mass index (BMI) of 32  categorizing her as obese.  Medical History: The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension and osteoarthritis. The family history was notable for her father having a pulmonary embolism at the age of 60. She reported a 30 pack-year smoking history and admitted to a sedentary lifestyle without regular exercises.  Diagnostic Assessment: A venous Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombus in the popliteal and femoral veins of the patient's right leg. Complete blood count  metabolic panel  and coagulation profile were within the normal range except for an elevated D-Dimer level. No genetic mutation associated with hypercoagulability was identified.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initiated on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an initial treatment. After five days  Oral direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)  Rivaroxaban  was initiated and planned to be continued for at least 3 months.  Follow-up and Outcomes: At a one-month follow-up visit  the patient reported a significant reduction in leg swelling  pain  and was able to ambulate without discomfort. Repeat venous Doppler showed recanalization of the affected veins  indicating successful treatment.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain  especially in patients with predisposing factors like obesity  immobilization  and a history of smoking. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment for DVT and can lead to successful recanalization and symptom relief. Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor for potential complications of anticoagulation therapy and the recurrence of thrombosis.

She was generally in good health apart from being post-menopausal  however  she reported a history of prolonged oral contraceptive use during her reproductive years. The patient lives in a rural community in Wisconsin  United States.  Past Medical History: The patient reported no previous significant illness or hospitalization until the present condition. Do not have any allergies or had operations in the past.   Family History: The patient's mother reportedly had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) at the age of 65. Her father died at the age of 82 from a myocardial infarction  and her two older brothers are alive and well with no significant medical history.  Social History: The patient is a non-smoker  rarely drinks alcohol  and has not been engaged in drug use. She lives with her husband and works as a high school teacher. She reports an overall sedentary lifestyle due to her job nature and lacks regular physical activity. The patient reports no recent travels or other potential risk factors for thromboembolic disease apart from her inherited risks and lifestyle.  Presenting Complaint: The patient first noted mild discomfort  redness  and swelling on her left calf that progressively worsened over a few days. The pain elevated and described it as a deep  throbbing ache exacerbated by standing or walking.   Clinical Examination: Physical examination revealed a slightly elevated body temperature at 38.2 degrees Celsius. Her left calf was swollen  warm  erythematous  and tender to touch. There were no signs of superficial vein thrombosis or varicosities. Pedal pulses were intact.   Investigations: A complete blood count and biochemistry tests were conducted  which were within normal ranges. A D-dimer test was positive and a Lower Limb Doppler Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Management: Upon diagnosis confirmation  the patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)  followed by transitioning to oral anticoagulant - Warfarin. She was advised to elevate her lower limb and wear compression stockings. Education was provided about signs and symptoms of possible complications  notably pulmonary embolism.   Follow Up: The patient has been scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor her response to therapy and any potential complications.  Conclusion: Given the patient’s family history  prolonged use of oral contraceptives  and sedentary lifestyle  it is a lesson for clinicians to take a comprehensive history and consider DVT in a differential diagnosis when relevant symptoms are present  despite the absence of recent triggering factors such as surgery  injury  or travel. The patient’s case underscores the importance of primary prevention strategies in patients with risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.

Clinical Findings: The patient presented in the clinic with several days of progressive level 6 to 7/10 pain (on the pain scale) in her left lower leg characterized as a dull ache and moderate swelling. On physical examination  her left calf appeared slightly red  warm  and swollen. There was tenderness along the calf veins upon palpation. Her right lower extremity appeared normal. She did not present fever or other systemic symptoms. She also complained of mild shortness of breath on exertion but no chest pain or dizziness.  Diagnostic Assessment: Baseline laboratory testing was performed and was largely unremarkable. D-dimer levels were clearly elevated. Venous duplex ultrasound revealed acute deep vein thrombosis in her left popliteal and posterior tibial veins. She was referred for chest computed tomography which ruled out the presence of pulmonary embolism.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  controlled through diet and oral hypoglycemic agents and a stable dose of ACE inhibitor  respectively. She had gone through menopause at 51 years old and was not on any hormone replacement therapy. She had no known personal or family history of coagulopathy or venous thromboembolism. She reported no recent hospitalization  surgery  pregnancy  or long-term immobilization.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and anticoagulant therapy was initiated immediately with intravenous heparin followed by oral warfarin for long-term use. Lifestyle modifications and the use of compressional stockings were recommended. Frequent monitoring of INR level was advised during her course of warfarin therapy.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient was observed for other potential complications and improvement in her symptoms. One month after initiation of therapy  the patient reported a significant reduction in her leg pain and swelling. Her warfarin dosage was adjusted to maintain an INR of 2 to 3.   Patient Perspective: The patient acknowledged her lack of physical activity and unhealthy diet as contributors to her risk factors. She expressed a commitment to follow the new lifestyle modifications and her warfarin regime to prevent the recurrence of deep vein thrombosis.   Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,1,Patient Presentation  Patient Profile Name: Mr. James Allen Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired textile mill worker Residence: Rural North Carolina   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Allen presented with a 3-day history of pain and swelling in his left calf which heightened when standing or walking. He also reported a slight fever and malaise.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Allen has a history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril. He suffered a stroke 2 years ago with no significant residual deficits.  Social History: He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He reports limited physical activity and is overweight with a BMI of 30. His diet mainly consists of Southern cuisine  high in fats and sugars.   Family History: His father suffered a myocardial infarction at 70 and his mother had diabetes and hypertension.   Investigations and Diagnosis: A venous Doppler ultrasound of his left leg was conducted which confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep veins  thus confirming a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The D-dimer levels in his blood samples were also elevated.   Treatment: The patient was promptly started on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin and transitioned to oral warfarin for long-term management. He was also advised on lifestyle modifications including dietary changes  increase in physical activity  and the importance of regular follow-ups.  Discussion: Mr. Allen's case is typical  given that he possesses several risk factors for DVT such as advanced age  history of stroke  and obesity. The rural setting may contribute to a lack of physical activity and access to healthcare facilities for routine checkups. His choice of high fat and sugar diet may have led to his condition of obesity and hypertension  which further increases the risk of DVT. This case underscores the importance of early detection  lifestyle modifications  and long-term anticoagulant therapy in the management of DVT. Regular follow-ups and monitoring of INR levels are crucial in managing the disease and preventing complications such as pulmonary embolism. The patient's family history of cardiovascular diseases points to a possible genetic predisposition  stressing the need for family screening procedures.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,2,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. Johnson   Age: 64   Gender: Male   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired school teacher   Location: Rural Illinois    Presenting Condition: Mr. Johnson is experiencing progressive swelling and pain in his right lower leg over the past four days. He states it feels quite heavy and the skin over the calf has become warm and reddish. He hasn't sustained any injuries or engaged in strenuous physical activity.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes twelve years ago and also has a history of hypertension. His diabetes is managed through oral medications and lifestyle modifications  and his hypertension is controlled with ACE inhibitors. He has been fairly compliant with his treatment but occasionally has difficulty managing his blood glucose levels. Moreover  he was a smoker for 30 years but has quit 10 years back. He rarely drinks alcohol and has no history of drug abuse.  Family History:  His father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother died at 85 due to a stroke. There is no known history of clotting disorders or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the family.  Physical Examination: On examination  his right calf is significantly larger than his left. There is localized warmth  erythema  and tenderness. The patient shows symptoms consistent with Homan's sign  a clinical sign for deep vein thrombosis. His BMI is recorded as 30  indicating obesity. No other abnormalities were found on physical examination.  Investigations: Preliminary blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. A Doppler ultrasound was ordered which confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep veins of right lower leg  diagnosing DVT.  Treatment Plan: The patient was admitted for treatment and started on low-molecular-weight heparin and oral anticoagulants as per standard guidelines for managing DVT. He will be monitored regularly for improvements and potential complications. Education is provided about the importance of early mobilization  leg exercises and maintaining a healthy weight. He will be recommended to a nutritionist for dietary counseling and advice regarding diabetic and weight management.  Review and Follow up: A follow-up is scheduled in two weeks to monitor the effect of anticoagulation therapy  check for side effects  and reassess risk factors. If the therapy is effective and there are no complications  Mr. Johnson's oral anticoagulant therapy will be continued for at least three months  as per current guidelines.  Conclusion: Mr. Johnson's case presents a typical manifestation of DVT. His case underlines the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation to prevent complications  especially pulmonary embolism. It also emphasizes the importance of managing modifiable risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and obesity to reduce overall morbidity.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,3,Patient Case Presentation: DVT   Patient Overview The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  identified as John Doe  from an urban setting in the northwest region of the United States.   Presenting Issue Mr. Doe came to the emergency department with complaints of swelling  pain  warm sensation  and tenderness over the skin  predominantly in his right lower leg  which has been worsening over the past three days. He denies trauma but states the pain appears to increase with walking.   Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he is on Metformin. He is also known to have hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril. He previously suffered a minor ischemic stroke two years ago but has since recovered with minor long-term effects. He is a former smoker  has a BMI of 29  indicative of obesity  and does not report routine physical activity.   Family History His mother had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 70  and his brother  65 years old  was also recently diagnosed with DVT. His father died at the age of 68 due to a myocardial infarction.   Imaging & Laboratory Findings Upon evaluation  a venous duplex ultrasound was conducted  which showed venous thrombosis in the right popliteal and femoral veins  confirming a diagnosis of DVT.  Treatment He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment  started on low-molecular-weight heparin  and transitioned to Warfarin with a goal INR of 2-3. Patient education was provided on the lifestyle modifications necessary for DVT management  including regular physical activity  leg elevation  wearing graduated compression stockings  and maintaining an appropriate diet.  He was also referred to a dietitian to help control his diabetes and to provide weight management guidance to reduce his BMI. He is scheduled for a follow-up in the outpatient clinic next week  and a referral for home health nursing has been arranged to monitor his Warfarin compliance and home safety.  Considerations Given the patient's medical history  family history  and lifestyle  there are several risk factors for DVT  including diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and family history of DVT. Strict management of these medical conditions and lifestyle modifications will be crucial in preventing recurrence and managing long-term health risks.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,4,"Patient Presentation:  Patient: Ms. Alice Brown Sex: Female Age: 68 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Presenting Problem: Ms. Brown presented at a local walk-in clinic with complaints of swelling  redness  and aching pain in her left lower leg. She had a noticeable limp.  Past Medical History: She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. She has a documented history of hypertension  controlled with medication (Lisinopril  10mg). She has had two uneventful pregnancies and underwent an appendectomy at age 24.   Recent History: Ms. Brown recently returned from a transatlantic flight to visit her daughter in England. She remembers her left leg feeling """"uncomfortable"""" during the journey but hasn't given much thought about it until the continual swelling and aching started.   Family History: Both her parents had cardiomyopathies and her sister has a history of stroke. Her father had deep vein thrombosis diagnosed at the age of 72.  Physical Examination: Patient vitals were stable. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable other than a slight elevation in her blood pressure (145/86 mmHg). The left lower extremity was noticeably swollen with local heat and redness compared to the right lower leg. There was extreme tenderness upon palpation.  Additional Investigations: D-dimer levels were elevated (0.78 mg/L FEU) hinting at some form of clot. A confirmatory Duplex ultrasonography was done  which reported a non-compressible left popliteal vein  confirming a deep vein thrombosis.  Given her symptoms upon presentation  the recent history of a long-haul flight  hypertension  and family history of vascular issues  the patient's diagnosis was confirmed as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Management: Ms. Brown was hospitalized and started on anticoagulant therapy with an initial dose of LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin)  followed by oral anticoagulants. Plans were made to monitor her regularly for symptomatic improvement and to prevent side effects and complications.  In conclusion  Ms. Brown's case emphasizes the importance of considering deep vein thrombosis in the differential diagnosis of any patient experiencing swelling  redness  or pain in the leg  particularly if risk factors such as recent immobilization  hypertension  relevant family history  or recent long-distance travel are present.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,5,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old African American female  named Mrs. Helen Jackson  who lives alone in a small apartment. She is a retired teacher  has been widowed for 5 years  and is of lower socioeconomic status.  Past Medical History:  In her past medical history  she has been treated for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 for the last ten years. She also has a history of varicose veins but has not sought any specific treatment for it. She has a history of smoking but quit 15 years ago. Mrs. Jackson is generally compliant with her medication and tends to use diet and lifestyle changes to manage her conditions (vegetarian diet  moderation in alcohol intake  mild-moderate exercise).   Presenting Chief Complaint: Mrs. Jackson has approached the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset  painful  and swollen right calf that started 24 hours ago. The pain is persistent and increases when she tries to stand or walk. There is no history of recent injury or trauma.   Family History: Her mother had diabetes  and her father died of stroke. She had a sister who died due to metastatic breast cancer. No known family history of clotting disorders exists.  Clinical Observation and Diagnostic Tests:  On physical examination  her right calf was noted to be warm  erythematous  swollen  and tender  with pain on palpation. Labs revealed D-Dimer levels to be elevated. A subsequent Doppler ultrasound test confirmed the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis in her right lower leg.  Treatment and Recommendations:  The treatment was initiated with anticoagulation therapy (Low Molecular Weight Heparin followed by Warfarin). She was further advised to increase her ambulation  use elastic compression stockings and to elevate the leg whenever seated or in bed. She was advised to promptly report any symptoms like chest pain or breathlessness  which could imply a pulmonary embolism. Due to her elevated risk for recurrent DVT  consideration was given for a longer-term anticoagulant therapy. Comprehensive patient education was also provided regarding her conditions  as well as steps to take to mitigate risks for recurrent DVT  like regular exercise  hydration  and avoiding long periods of immobility.  Discussions on the role of aspirin or newer oral anticoagulants for primary or secondary DVT prevention  as well as a referral to a hematologist to discuss possible genetic testing for clotting disorders  were done.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,6,Patient's Profile:  The patient in question is a 52-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  currently residing in an urban area. He is a non-smoker and moderate consumer of alcohol  and his occupation involves extensive sitting hours as a software engineer.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presented with complaints of swelling  warmth  and pain in his left calf for the past week. He reports no recent injuries to his leg and no history of similar complaints.   Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medications. He underwent a right hip replacement surgery two years ago. The patient is on anti-hypertensive  oral hypoglycemic  and statin medication. Smith's body mass index is 31  indicating his overweight status. He sustained a myocardial infarction five years ago  for which he received appropriate treatment.  Family History:  The family history reveals that both of Mr. Smith's parents had type 2 diabetes and his father died from a stroke at the age of 65.  Clinical Findings and Investigations:  On examination  the left calf was swollen and tender with deep red discoloration. The patient’s vital signs are stable. He was sent for an urgent doppler ultrasonography of the lower limbs  which showed the absence of venous flow in the left popliteal and posterior tibial veins  suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. His D-dimer level was also elevated.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s clinical presentation and investigation findings  a diagnosis of left lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made.  Treatment and Progress:  Mr. Smith was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin and later bridged to warfarin therapy. He was instructed to elevate his leg and to wear compression stockings. Exercise and weight reduction were also recommended. Regression of swelling and pain reported in follow-up after two weeks.   Considering Mr. Smith's personal and family history  he was considered for a hereditary thrombophilia screening. Genetic counseling was discussed based on the outcome of this screening.   Conclusion:  Mr. Smith's case demonstrates that deep vein thrombosis can occur in individuals with risk factors such as immobility  co-morbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes  family history of thrombotic events  and being overweight. Appropriate and prompt management is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,7,Patient Presentation:  Mr. M is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who presented with pain and swelling in his right calf. The pain was described as aching  rated at an intensity of 7 on a scale of 1 to 10  and was reported to be progressively increasing over a week. There have been no cases of similar symptoms in the past. Notably  the patient flew in from Australia three weeks prior to his presentation  a journey lasting about 23 hours.   Past Medical History:  Mr. M reports a history of hypercholesterolemia  controlled with statins for the past five years. Progress notes also indicate a 35-year history of smoking a pack per day. Mr. M quit ten years ago  but the damage to his vascular system remains significant. He was previously diagnosed with early-stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) but has not required much intervention till date. He doesn't have any history of cancer or hematological disorders. His routine medication includes atorvastatin  and an inhaler (tiotropium bromide) as required for his COPD.  Family History:  His father had an unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 50  indicating a possible familial predisposition. His mother passed away at an early age from breast cancer.  Social History:  The patient is a retired high school woodwork teacher. He lives with his wife in New York. Drinks alcohol socially and  as mentioned before  has a history of smoking. He also leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle with little exercise.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A Doppler ultrasound was performed and confirmed the presence of extensive DVT in his right leg. Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels. Coupled with the patient's extended recent air travel  a diagnosis of provoked DVT was made. His hematologist is conducting additional genetic testing to establish if there is an inherited thrombophilia  given the family history of DVT.  Conclusion:  Mr. M's presentation of leg pain and swelling  together with an elevated D-dimer level and a positive ultrasound  led to a diagnosis of provoked deep vein thrombosis. Factors contributing to his heightened risk for this condition include his advanced age  a history of prolonged sedentary travel  and a history of smoking. Further testing is required to determine if there is inherited thrombophilia. The patient has been initiated on anticoagulant therapy as is standard for the management of DVT. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,8,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mrs. Smith Age: 65 Ethnicity: African-American Job: Retired Teacher  Mrs. Smith is a 65-year-old African-American female patient  a retired teacher of middle school history. She is married and has four adult children. The patient presents with a chief complaint of pain and swelling in her right lower leg for the past five days. She characterizes the pain as constant and moderately severe (7/10). She denies any trauma  recent surgery  or prolonged periods of immobility.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are well-controlled with Amlodipine and Metformin respectively. She had a hysterectomy at age 52 due to fibroids and has been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) since.  Family History: Her father died at the age of 72  from a stroke  and her mother had breast cancer diagnosed in her late sixties but is currently in remission. She has a sibling with coronary artery disease  and a family history of deep vein thrombosis is unclear.  Social History: Mrs. Smith has never smoked or drank alcohol. She lives with her husband in the city and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to arthritis. She travels periodically  most recently a long flight 2 weeks ago to visit her daughter out of state.  Physical Examination: Her right lower extremity is visibly swollen and red  with palpable warmth over the affected area. She has a positive Homan’s sign. There is no noticeable deformity or skin changes except for discoloration at the swollen site.  Investigations: Doppler ultrasound revealed the presence of a thrombus obstructing blood flow in the Calf Vein  confirming the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis.  Comments: Given Mrs. Smith's sedentary lifestyle  her recent long-distance flight  her age  and her use of HRT  she has multiple risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombosis. If left untreated  this could lead to serious complications such as a pulmonary embolism. The American Heart Association estimates that 60 000-100 000 Americans die of deep vein thrombosis/PE each year.  Plan: Mrs. Smith has been immediately started on low molecular weight heparin  concomitantly started on Warfarin and will be discharged once her INR reaches therapeutic range. She has been counselled about the importance of mobility and elevating her leg. She is also advised to think about a potential change to her HRT considering her now two major risk factors - HRT use and the confirmed DVT. She is scheduled to follow up in clinic in 1 week to recheck her INR and adjust her Warfarin dosing as necessary. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,9,Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Anthony  presented to the emergency department with complaints suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He was a retired construction worker  living with his wife in suburban Los Angeles  California. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is on Metformin of 500mg daily. The patient also reportedly has mild obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.5.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Anthony reported persistent heaviness and pain in his right lower limb for the past couple of days  accompanied by mild swelling and redness. He had no history of trauma or injury to the leg. He also reported shortness of breath which worsened on mild exertion.  Family History: No significant family history of cardiovascular disease  thrombotic disorders  or chronic illnesses could be traced  except for an elder brother who had passed away due to lung cancer. This family history is substantial as it can indicate whether there might be any inherited disorders that increase the risk of DVT.  Physical Assessment: Upon examination  the patient’s right calf was warm  swollen  and tender  raising suspicion of DVT. However  other systemic examinations were within normal limits.  Investigation: His vital signs showed elevated blood pressure (BP - 140/90mmHg). A Doppler Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep veins of his right lower leg. His blood tests showed a slightly elevated blood sugar level (HbA1c - 7.2%)  high D-Dimer levels (1000ng/ml)  and increased Clotting time (PT - 16 sec  APTT - 35 sec). A chest X-ray was normal.  Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical presentation  and investigation results  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was established.  Management: The patient was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for immediate anticoagulation and was recommended for oral Warfarin thereafter. Specific instructions on lifestyle modifications  including weight management  were given to reduce the risk of DVT recurrence. The patient was also advised to wear compression stockings and mobilize frequently since prolonged immobilization can increase the risk for DVT.   The patient's diabetes was considered in his management. His metformin dose was readjusted  his diet was reviewed with him  he was advised to regular exercise  and regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure his sugar levels were well controlled.  This presentation aims to represent a typical patient diagnosed with DVT in a western society. However  it's important to note that DVT can affect any age  gender  and population group.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,10,Patient Presentation  Patient Details:  Our patient  Mr. Johnson is a 52-year-old African-American male presenting with a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He's a non-smoker but is overweight and has a sedentary job as an office worker. Mr. Johnson has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:  He has a documented medical history of Type II diabetes and hypertension. Both are managed by medication (metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension). He has no previous history of any vascular disorders or clotting abnormalities. He admits non-compliance to the recommended lifestyle changes such as diet modification and regular physical exercises.  Family history:  Upon questioning  Mr. Johnson revealed that his father had a stroke at the age of 58. He also stated that his brother was recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. No family history of clotting disorders or cancer was reported.  Recent Events Relevant to Condition:  Mr. Johnson recently experienced left calf pain which is unusual for him. The discomfort started suddenly while he was on a long distance flight returning from a business trip. The pain has been progressively worsening  associated with noticeable calf swelling and mild skin discoloration. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or any other respiratory symptoms.   Initial Findings:  Physical examination revealed left calf tenderness  warmth  swelling  and erythema suggestive of DVT which was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. The patient’s blood pressure was mildly elevated at the clinic visit (145/95mmHg)  and his random blood sugar reading was not well-controlled (176 mg/dl).   Given his history of diabetes  hypertension  sedentary lifestyle  recent long plane flight and subsequent presentation of symptoms  Mr. Johnson falls under a high-risk category for developing DVT. His family’s history of vascular disorders also lends support to the diagnosis.  Management:  Hypercoagulable workup was done which was unremarkable. He was started on therapeutic low molecular weight Heparin in hospital and discharged on oral anticoagulation with instructions to follow up in a week. He was advised regarding the importance of medication compliance  weight loss  diet modification  and physical exercise.   The patient was counseled about signs of pulmonary embolism  a serious complication of DVT  and instructed to return immediately if any of these symptoms were to develop.  This case represents a common presentation of DVT  emphasizing the critical role numerous risk factors including long-term immobility  increased age  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  and certain genetic predispositions can play in its development. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,11,Patient Presentation:   Our patient  Mr. John McKenzie  is a 67-year-old African-American male diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He is a retired construction worker and is presently residing in Orlando  Florida  with his wife.   Demographics:   Mr. McKenzie  who belongs to one of the most vulnerable demographic groups  represents the estimated 1-2 cases per 1000 adults diagnosed with DVT in the United States every year. The incidence of DVT is higher among African-Americans compared to other racial groups.   Presenting Issues and Symptoms:  Around a week ago  Mr. McKenzie started complaining of discomfort in his left leg. A few days later  he noticed swelling and warmth along with a dull ache in the calf region. He also reported an intense cramping pain in his calf upon standing or walking.   Medical History:  Mr. McKenzie has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension which he manages through medication and a controlled diet. He has had a prior surgery for cataracts in both eyes two years back. Mr. McKenzie is a former smoker  having quit 15 years back and is occasionally consuming alcohol socially. He is also overweight which places him at additional risk for DVT.   Family History:  His father had suffered from stroke at an old age and his mother was diagnosed with diabetes and suffered from varicose veins. His only sibling  a brother  was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease in his early sixties. This family history may have predisposed Mr. McKenzie to his current DVT diagnosis.   Current Diagnosis:  After thorough examination by a physician  Mr. McKenzie's discomfort was not deemed to be a simple cramp. Ultrasonographic venography confirmed the presence of a blood clot in the deep veins of his left calf  confirming the diagnosis of DVT.   Plan of action:  Mr. McKenzie was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy. A Rivaroxaban regimen has been initiated for rapid and targeted anticoagulation. His dosage will be adjusted after a period of 3 weeks. Lifestyle changes such as reduced salt intake  a balanced diet  regular physical activity  and compression stockings were suggested to manage his current health situation better.  This case emphasizes the importance of early detection and management of Deep Vein Thrombosis  particularly in patients who have multiple risk factors like in the case of Mr. McKenzie. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,12,Presentation:  The patient  Mrs. Alice Johnson  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presented with complaints of acute onset  unilateral calf pain and mild swelling in her right leg over the past two days. Prior to her presentation  she had been observing a sedentary lifestyle due to a recent right hip fracture which she sustained after a minor fall at home about two weeks ago. She was discharged at home after a successful hip pinning surgery  and she has been less mobile since then.  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on regular medication for these conditions  which include Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. There is no known drug allergy. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. Her women's health history indicates she is post-menopausal with no history of hormone replacement therapy.  Regarding her family history  her father had Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  which led to his death at the age of 74. Her mother is alive and well. Alice has two siblings  one brother diagnosed with high blood pressure  just like Alice  and a sister with no known health issues.  On examination  there is mild edema in her right leg  with mild erythema. There is tenderness in the calf muscle  but there is no palpable cord. Pulses are palpable and equal bilaterally. Bilateral lower limbs are warm with no heating.  D-dimer test was ordered  the result of which came back as high  indicating likely thrombosis. An Ultrasound Doppler was then performed which confirmed our suspicion and showed a thrombus in the right calf vein.   She was diagnosed with the right lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  categorized as a provoked DVT due to recent hip surgery and immobility. Alice was started on anticoagulants and was educated on the importance of mobilization and leg elevation.  This case highlights the importance of considering deep vein thrombosis in patients with recent surgery or immobilization who present with unilateral leg pain  especially when associated with risk factors such as age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiac diseases. Active measures for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis are crucial in the management of such patients. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,13,Patient Profile:  Ms. Jane Doe  a 45-year-old Caucasian woman  is a sedentary office worker with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. She lives alone and does not have children. She was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which was confirmed through a venography procedure.  Medical History:  Ms. Doe has a history of hypertension  which has been managed with medication for the past 10 years. She is also pre-diabetic  with a diagnosis for the last two years  and has been managing her glucose levels via diet and exercise. Four years ago  the patient underwent an abdominal hysterectomy due to excessive uterine bleeding and the development of uterine fibroids.  Current Health Status:  Currently  Ms. Doe has reported persistent pain and swelling in her left lower leg for several days  which led to her seeking medical attention. Upon physical examination  the calf was warm to touch and there was a pronounced venous dilation. With the aid of a venogram  a DVT diagnosis was confirmed  and it was localized in the left popliteal and femoral veins. Aside from the leg symptoms  she also complained of occasional dizziness.  Family History:  A significant family history was revealed during the consultation. Her father had a heart attack at age 60  while her mother suffered a stroke at 67. An older sibling has Type 2 diabetes  and her younger sister has obesity-related complications. No instances of DVT or other blood clotting disorders were reported in the family.  Social History:  Ms. Doe is a life-long nonsmoker and does not take alcohol frequently. Her sedentary lifestyle involves long hours of sitting at her desk due to her job as an accounts officer at a local company. She does not engage in any form of regular physical activity.  Treatment Plan:  Ms. Doe was started on anticoagulant (warfarin) therapy and has been advised to limit her immobility. Activities such as short walks with compression stockings have been recommended. She has been assigned a dietitian to work on her meal plans alongside her pre-diabetic care  and a wellness coach to improve her physical activity. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled  and she was advised to seek immediate medical care if she experienced symptoms like chest pain  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis  due to possible anticoagulation-related complications and/or pulmonary embolism.  This case illustrates the potential consequences of a sedentary lifestyle  particularly in individuals with existing risk factors such as hypertension  obesity  and a history of surgery; all of which are known risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,14,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Gray  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  came into the clinic presenting symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Mr. Gray works as an accountant and leads a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. Apart from his work  he enjoys watching television and admits that he does not engage in any significant physical activities.  Past Medical History:  Previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  Mr. Gray has been under antihypertensive medication and statin therapy for the last 8 years. His regular medications include Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. His last annual check-up  six months ago  showed controlled blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There was no history of any surgery or blood clot related issues.  Family history:  Mr. Gray’s father passed away at the age of 70 from a stroke and his mother  now 85  is currently living with type 2 diabetes. Given his family history  Mr. Gray has an elevated genetic predisposition towards cardiovascular diseases.  Present Illness:  Recently  Mr. Gray noted persistent discomfort  swelling  and redness in his right lower leg. These symptoms were initially dismissed as the result of a cramp but later  the calf pain intensified  especially when walking which brought him in for the check-up.  Clinical observations:  Upon clinical evaluation  there is significant edema in his right calf and ankle. His right calf circumference is 3 cm larger than the left. There is mild erythema and the area is locally warm  suggesting local inflammation.  Plan:  The clinical findings and his lifestyle factors indicate a high probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Doctors have recommended the D-dimer blood test and duplex ultrasound for definitive diagnosis. If confirmed  anticoagulation therapy will be initiated.  Discussion:  DVT is a common condition  particularly in patients with limited mobility and those with a family history of clotting disorders. Physical examination  coupled with the patient’s history  can often provide a high degree of suspicion. In Mr. Gray’s case  his sedentary lifestyle  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension are major risk factors. His family history suggests a higher genetic risk for clotting disorders. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can decrease the risk of serious complications like pulmonary embolism. It also will be important to discuss with Mr. Gray lifestyle changes including increased physical activity that could decrease his risk for future DVT.  Conclusion:  A balance of clinical observations  patient history  and the diagnostic test will guide the effective management of Mr. Gray's condition  potentially mitigating the adverse outcomes associated with DVT and significantly improving his quality of life.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,15,Patient Presentation:  Name: David Fisher Age: 68 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Teacher  Past Medical History:  David has a history of hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications and monthly follow-ups. He has also been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for ten years  for which he is on Metformin. He is an ex-smoker  having quit tobacco 7 years ago after a 25-year habit. He holds an occasional glass of wine over the weekend. There's no record of any previous surgical interventions.  Presenting Complaint: David presents with symptoms of left leg swelling and pain  which started gradually about a week ago. The pain is worse on standing for prolonged durations and has spontaneous bouts that linger throughout the day. He denies any recent travel  surgical procedures or previous similar episodes. He describes experiencing mild shortness of breath recently  but no chest pain.  Family History: David's father succumbed to a heart attack at the age of 72. His mother is 90 years old and has Alzheimer's disease. He has one sibling  a brother  who is 65 and is in general good health.   Examination & Evaluation: David is overweight with a BMI of 29. Upon physical examination  his left lower leg was noted to be moderately swollen  erythematous  and warm to touch compared with the right  and he demonstrated a positive Homan's sign. Vitals – BP 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 82/min  respiratory rate 16/min  temperature 98.6°F.  Serum D-Dimer levels were found significantly elevated. Doppler ultrasound of the left leg revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the posterior tibial vein.  Assessment & Plan: David was started on treatment with therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin). The necessity for early mobilization  postural maneuvers and wearing compression stockings was explained. He was counseled about the possible risk of pulmonary embolism and advised to report immediately if symptoms such as chest pain or sudden shortness of breath develop. Instruction on the lifestyle modifications to control Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension was reinforced.   The social services team is involved to assess his home environment and provide necessary assistance for his medical condition. Outpatient follow-up in one week for monitoring his response to treatment has been scheduled.  Discussion: In summary  David is a 68-year-old male with a notable history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  who presented with symptoms consistent with DVT. The management plan prioritizes the immediate control of DVT and monitoring for potential complications. Due to his lifestyle and underlying conditions  David is at an increased risk; thus  a multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to ensure effective treatment and follow-up.   Informed by demographics  his age  sex  and race place him in a high-risk category for DVT. According to the literature  post-menopausal women have a slightly lower risk of DVT compared to men of the same age (White  R.). This patient's co-morbidity with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension further increases the risk  warranting careful management and follow-up.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,20,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Jenkins  a 68-year-old African-American male  was referred to the vascular clinic following an incidental finding of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Past Medical History: His past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  stage 3 chronic kidney disease from hypertension  and a splenectomy following a road traffic accident 15 years ago. He had a 30-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He has been on antihypertensive medications (calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors) and a bronchodilator for his COPD.  Complete Demographics: Mr. Jenkins is retired  lives alone in suburban Atlanta  Georgia. He held a job as a school bus driver before his retirement. He is widowed and has two adult children living out of state. Mr. Jenkins has Medicare and supplementary insurance through a retiree union benefit.  Presenting Complaint: He presented with no acute complaints and said he felt “just fine.” A recent abdominal ultrasound for an unrelated concern (unexplained weight loss) incidentally discovered an uncharacterized deep venous thrombosis in the lower abdomen.  Family History: His father died at 72 from a heart attack  and his mother died at 76 from stroke complications. He has a younger brother diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.  Physical Examination and Laboratory Results: Vital signs revealed blood pressure to be 139/85 mmHg with all other vital signs within normal rates. His BMI is 27. The physical examination was unremarkable except for reduced breath sounds bilaterally  consistent with his COPD. Labs showed mildly impaired kidney function  slightly raised D-dimer levels  and a Hemoglobin level of 12 g/dl.   Impression: Given his presentation and unprovoked  asymptomatic DVT on ultrasound  Mr. Jenkins was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Unprovoked DVT might indicate an underlying disorder such as a malignancy  especially since he recently experienced unexplained weight loss. We decided on a multidisciplinary approach with consultation from the oncology team and ordered further scans and blood tests to identify the possible causes. Besides  he is at high risk of pulmonary embolism due to his DVT and COPD  warranting a decision to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation.   Plan: Mr. Jenkins is scheduled for a CT scan and blood tests. We plan to begin anticoagulation therapy and are discussing various options  such as warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. We also plan for monitoring  regular follow-ups  lifestyle changes  and potential referral to a nephrologist for his kidney disease.  This case demonstrates the need for vigilance and thorough investigation when dealing with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis  considering the significant comorbidities and risk factors present in this patient  including age  race  chronic kidney disease  and history of smoking. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,21,Patient Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographic Details: John Brown is a 68-year-old  Caucasian male retired construction worker  who lives in the midwestern region of the United States. He is married with three adult children and five grandchildren  has adequate family support  and resides in a suburban neighborhood.   Presenting Complaint and History of Present Illness: Mr. Brown presented with rubor and edema in his left lower leg  which he noticed upon waking up. The onset was sudden  and he experienced a dull ache and a feeling of warmth in the area. He denies any injury or trauma to the area but admits to a recent 6-hour car ride. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a history of Type II Diabetes  controlled with metformin  and obesity (BMI of 30). He quit smoking five years ago but had a significant 30 pack-year prior. He also has a past history of hypertension  controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. He underwent an appendectomy approximately 20 years ago.  Family History: His mother had coronary artery disease and passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 78. His father had a stroke at age 65 but is still alive. His eldest sister has atrial fibrillation  but otherwise  there's no other significant family history. No history of clotting disorders in the family.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  his left lower leg was slightly larger than the right one. Pulses were palpable on both legs  but the left leg was warmer and had a slightly deeper color than the right one. There are no ulcerations or skin changes  no varicose veins. His cardiovascular and respiratory exam was unremarkable.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Given the clinical signs  DVT was suspected. An ultrasound Doppler study was performed and confirmed a clot in the left popliteal vein. D-dimer values were elevated  reinforcing the diagnosis. Subsequent blood work-up  including complete blood count  glucose levels  potassium  liver function tests  and kidney function tests  were all within normal limits.  Conclusion: Mr. Brown has Deep Vein Thrombosis  most likely due to prolonged sitting during his recent trip. His history of smoking  Diabetes and hypertension  and obesity also adds to his risk factor list. Currently  he is at risk of pulmonary embolism due to DVT and needs to be started on anticoagulation therapy promptly. Patient education and management of risk factors will be an integral part of his future management plan.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,22,Patient's Profile:   Name: Jane Doe Age: 48 years Gender: Female Race: African American Occupation: Office administrator (Desk-bound job  8 hours a day) Marital Status: Widowed Living conditions: Lives alone Location: Urban Midwest  USA  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for ten years  on medication - Obesity with a BMI of 32 kg/m2  no weight loss attempts - 2 years post-menopausal status - Social history consists of being a former smoker and occasional alcohol consumption  Family Medical History: - Mother passed away from a heart attack; had history of hypertension and obesity - Father alive and well with no known major illness - No siblings - Has two children  both are physically fit and healthy  Presenting Complaint: The patient came to the emergency department complaining of unilateral swelling  pain  and tenderness in her right leg.   Investigations: On routine examination  her vital signs are stable. Physical examination revealed swelling  redness  and warmth in the right calf area. A D-Dimer test was positive. An ultrasound confirmed a clot in the deep vein of the right leg below her knee.  Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Plan: Initiation of anticoagulant therapy (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] followed by a direct oral anticoagulant). Patient education on the importance of regular exercise  weight reduction  dietary modification  and regular follow-up visits.   Discussion: In considering the patient's demographics  it is notable that African American women  particularly in the Midwest region  have a higher risk of DVT due to higher rates of obesity and hypertension. The patient's sedentary occupation coupled with her past medical history of obesity and hypertension has likely contributed to her DVT. Her age  postmenopausal status  and history of smoking may also be risk factors in her present condition.   Her family history of heart disease is a significant factor worth noting as DVT can lead to life-threatening complications like a pulmonary embolism. Early diagnosis and management are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality in such cases.   Based on these factors  a comprehensive plan was developed that includes medical treatment for DVT and lifestyle modification guidance to prevent recurrence and control other risk factors. The patient was also advised to have regular follow-ups for monitoring her status and response to the treatment plan.

Apart from his current medication for hypertension and diabetes  Mr. Williams has no known drug allergies. He does not take any over-the-counter medications or supplements and denies substance abuse.  Mr. Williams underwent an ultrasound that revealed a clot in the deep vein of his left leg confirming the diagnosis. His coagulation parameters  d-dimer test  were increased  and his platelet count was within normal limits.   Post diagnosis  an appropriate treatment plan recommended by a hematologist was initiated  encompassing anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulant  rivaroxaban). Upon discharge  patient education about DVT  lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  healthier dietary practices  and close monitoring of his diabetes and hypertension are emphasized.   This case showcases the critical importance of considering the risk factors associated with DVT such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  diabetes  and genetic predisposition in older adults. Furthermore  it underscores the need for regular health check-ups and lifestyle modifications to avoid serious health conditions. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,24,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female named Katharine  who resides in a suburban Middle American city. She was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and arthritis. She has been a smoker for 40 years with a 20 pack per year history. She denies alcohol or illicit drug usage. Katharine has a BMI of 30  signifying obesity but is attempting to manage this with dietary adjustments and walking. She lives with her husband  she has two adult children  and she recently retired from her job as a school teacher.   Family History: Katharine’s family history is profound with cardiovascular diseases. Her mother had a stroke at 67  and her father died from a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at 72. Her older sister was diagnosed with DVT at the age of 58.   Details of Current Medical Condition: Katharine started experiencing swelling and acute  localized pain in her left leg about a week ago. She thought it was initially related to her arthritis but became more concerned as her symptoms worsened  and she started feeling mild shortness of breath. This resulted in her presentant to the Emergency Department.   On admission  her vitals are stable  and she is afebrile but with pedal edema noted in the left leg  which was warm to touch  erythematous and tender  indicating possible DVT.   Investigations: D-dimer was elevated and an ultrasound Doppler of the leg confirmed a non-compressible left popliteal vein  consistent with a diagnosis of DVT. The chest x-ray was normal  ruling out any immediate signs of pulmonary embolism.   Current Management Plan: Following diagnosis  Katharine was started on anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Plans were outlined for transitioning to a novel oral anticoagulant  direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)  for long-term management before discharge.   Katharine was also scheduled to receive counsel on smoking cessation  nutrition  weight management  and exercise to ameliorate risk factors.   This brief case illustrates some of the key details required in diagnosing DVT and planning its management within the context of the patient’s overall health  lifestyle  and family history. It is important to note that adjustments may be necessary based on contextual or patient-specific variations.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,26,Case Presentation:  Patient Identification: Mr. John is a 60-year-old African American male who lives in a suburban area.  Presenting Issue: John presented to the ED with complaints of increasing left lower leg pain and visible redness  which have been ongoing for the past week. He denies any recent injuries but mentions that his job as an office clerk involves sitting for long hours.  Past Medical History: John has a history of controlled hypertension for which he is taking medication. He also has obesity (BMI: 33.4)  with no known diagnosis of diabetes or any related metabolic disorders. John is a former smoker and quit 5 years ago after smoking for around 35 years.   Family History: There is a noted history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the family. His father had a heart attack at 62  and his older brother is under treatment for peripheral artery disease. No reported history of blood clotting disorders.  Social History: John is divorced and lives alone  but his daughter is nearby and checks on him regularly. He is retired from his administrative job. He doesn't consume alcohol and quit smoking years ago.   Investigations: Upon physical examination  his left lower leg was noticeably swollen and warm to the touch. D-dimer levels were elevated  leading to a ultrasound Doppler study which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in his left lower leg  indicative of deep vein thrombosis.  Diagnosis:  Based on the physical examination and ultrasound results  John has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Plan: The management plan includes anticoagulation therapy. He was started on low-molecular-weight heparin and oral warfarin. We discussed the risk of pulmonary embolism as a possible complication of DVT  and emphasized the importance of immediate medical attention should he have symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness. Education was provided on the importance of exercise and advised to avoid long periods of immobility. He will be followed up in the outpatient setting for monitoring INR and adjusting warfarin dose.  This case presents a commonly seen condition in the ED. John's risk factors include his age  prolonged sitting due to his job  obesity  and history of smoking. His ethnicity also places him at a slightly higher risk  as African Americans have been found to have a slightly higher prevalence rate. As per the literature  males are more likely to develop DVT (ratio of 1.2 males for every 1 female)  which aligns with this case.

There's tenderness along the vein. Her vitals are stable  and cardiovascular system examination is within normal limits. The right lower limb appears normal.   Assessment:  The clinical findings and family history of clotting disorders highly suggest a likely diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.   Plan:  The patient was recommended to undergo Duplex Ultrasound for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of DVT. Lab work  including Complete Blood Count (CBC)  coagulation profile (PT  APTT  INR)  were ordered. Upon confirmation  anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin would be started. A referal to hematology for evaluation of possible inherited thrombophilia in light of family history was also planned. Patient education regarding DVT  lifestyle modification advice  particularly addressing her sedentary work conditions and obesity  were also provided.  This case emphasizes the relevance of family history in identifying risk of thrombotic disorders and the importance of addressing modifiable lifestyle factors in disease management.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,28,Patient Information:  Name: John Williams Age: 57 years old Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Truck Driver  Chief Complaint: Patient presented with chronic pain and recent swelling of the right lower leg.  History of Present Illness: The patient has been experiencing symptoms of dull aching in his right lower leg for the past month. This discomfort intensified over the last week  leading to swelling of the affected area. The patient had no associated symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  or changes in the color of his skin.  Medical History: He is known to have controlled hypertension for which he takes daily medication. The patient had an episode of right leg cellulitis 2 years ago which was successfully treated with antibiotics.  Family History: Father had a myocardial infarction at age 65 and mother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis at 60. He has one brother who is healthy.  Social History: Patient is a long-haul truck driver and is often seated for up to 10 hours a day. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes every day for the past 20 years but does not consume alcohol. His diet is majorly fast food due to his profession.  Physical Examination: Right lower extremity appeared swollen with warm skin temperature. Positive Homan’s sign was recognized and palpable cord could be felt in the right popliteal fossa.  Investigation and Diagnosis: D-dimer levels were elevated  raising suspicion for DVT. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the right popliteal vein consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further blood work showed no abnormalities.  Treatment Plan: A heparin drip was started immediately  progressing to warfarin for a long-term anticoagulation. Lifestyle modifications were advised including cessation of smoking  improving diet and incorporating regular exercise. He was counseled on the importance of taking regular breaks during his long-haul routes to exercise his legs.  Prognosis: Patient's prognosis depends on his adherence to lifestyle modifications and medical therapy  and whether he develops post-thrombotic syndrome  or recurrent DVT.  This case underlines the importance of considering deep vein thrombosis in patients with risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle  family history of thrombotic events  and chronic smoking  even in the absence of evident respiratory symptoms. Regular monitoring and follow-ups are essential.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,29,Patient Presentation:  The patient  referred to hereafter as Mr. M  is a 58-year-old Caucasian male belonging to a middle-income socioeconomic bracket. His occupation involves consistent long-distance driving for a transportation service. Mr. M is a current smoker with a 20-pack year smoking history but denies alcohol or drug use. He lives with his wife and has two sons in their 20s. Mr. M was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia eight years back and is on appropriate medications. He does not have a known history of diabetes  stroke  or heart disease. However  there is a notable family history  with both Mr. M's father and cousin having experienced myocardial infarctions.  He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of progressive  sudden onset left calf pain along with mild swelling and erythema  that progressively worsened over three days. The pain was non-radiating  constant  worsened with walking  and partly relieved by rest. He denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  fever  or recent surgeries and hadn't been on any prolonged periods of immobility except his occasional long-distance driving.  On physical examination  his vital signs were stable. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Local examination of the left lower limb showed mild edema and tenderness in the left calf region  warmth and erythema were also observed. A negative Homan's sign was elicited.   His lab reports revealed a D-Dimer level that exceeded the upper limits of normal. Given the risk factors  clinical presentation  and lab findings  he was suspected to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was further evaluated with a compression ultrasound which revealed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT.  The discussion with Mr. M involved the urgent need for anticoagulation therapy  lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  changed work schedule to avoid prolonged immobility  regular exercises  especially calf-muscle exercises  and weight loss. He was also advised on the potential need for follow-ups to avoid post-thrombotic syndrome and to monitor for signs of a pulmonary embolism.  This clinical scenario reflects a classic case of DVT  considering that it is relatively more common among older Caucasian males with certain risk factors like smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and prolonged immobility. As observed in literature  multidisciplinary care that involves medical  lifestyle  and psychological aspects is crucial for such patients.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,30,Patient Identification: The patient is a 60-year-old African American male named Mr. Thompson.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with increased discomfort  warmth  redness  and swelling in his right calf.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of Type II diabetes  hypertension  and had an ischemic stroke three years ago  but made a satisfactory recovery. He also has a 20-year history of tobacco use  though he quit smoking a year ago.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 58. His mother  currently 80  suffers from hypertension but otherwise enjoys good health.  Social History: Mr. Thompson is a retired engineer who is moderately active. He lives with his wife and occasionally enjoys playing golf. His diet is relatively balanced  but he reports a tendency to overeat.  Clinical Assessment: A thorough physical examination revealed that his right calf was noticeably swollen and warm to the touch. Palpation resulted in pain. There was no evident trauma or injury to the surrounding area.  Investigations: A Doppler ultrasound examination confirmed a clot in the calf deep vein consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Management: The patient was admitted for monitored anticoagulation therapy  starting with intravenous Heparin and transitioning to oral Warfarin. His response to therapy has been positive  and he is due for a follow-up appointment with the vascular clinic.  Discussion: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) has a prevalence rate of about 1 in 1000 in the United States  with men and African Americans having a somewhat higher risk. Mr. Thompson's age  diabetes  history of stroke  previous smoking  and family history of cardiovascular diseases make him a typical DVT patient.  It's crucial that Mr. Thompson maintains healthy lifestyle habits such as regular exercise and a balanced diet to help manage his DVT and other health conditions. He should also be counseled on the importance of adhering to his anticoagulation therapy to prevent a recurrent DVT or a pulmonary embolism.  This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and management of DVT  particularly in patients with multiple risk factors. Also  it's a reminder to assess patients' social history and lifestyle habits  which can significantly impact disease development and management.  It is necessary to educate Mr. Thompson about DVT symptoms  such as warmth  swelling  and redness in the leg  and to immediately seek medical attention if these occur. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,31,Patient Presentation  Mr. J.C.  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department complaining of dull ache in his left calf muscle which progressively worsened over the past 4 days. He lives with his wife in Austin  Texas  where he works as a gardener. He doesn't use tobacco but has a moderate alcohol intake  primarily wine. His body mass index (BMI) is noted to be 33  indicating obesity.  Past Medical History  His past medical history is significant for hypertension  well-controlled with metoprolol. He also has known type II diabetes mellitus managed with metformin and occasional insulin. He was hospitalized five years ago for a myocardial infarction  which led to a left ventricular block managed with a pacemaker. Three months ago  J.C. had a routine pacemaker check and everything was within normal limits.  Family History   There is a relevant family history of ischemic heart disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 64 and his brother underwent angioplasty at 57 due to atherosclerosis. There's no recorded family history directly linked to hematologic disorders or malignancy.  Current Presentation  Physical examination reveals a swollen left calf  which is also warm to touch and more so compared to his right calf. Pedal pulses are intact bilaterally. Bedside Doppler ultrasound report shows blood clot in the left deep veins of the calf  confirming a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). His empirical Wells score on presentation was 3  suggestive of moderate probability for DVT.  Given the fact that J.C is over 60 years old  is obese  has co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension  has a history of prolonged immobility periods due to his previous hospitalization and leads a sedentary lifestyle  he falls into the high-risk category for DVT. Incidentally  the high prevalence of DVT in the Caucasian population corroborates his risk status.  The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation therapy with Low Molecular Weight Heparin along with a plan to bridge with Warfarin and advised for close follow-up.  Clinical Course and Progress  The patient responded well to the treatment and his leg swelling has decreased significantly at his two-week follow-up appointment. No complications were reported during his hospital stay or after discharge  and he continues to be on maintenance Warfarin therapy. He has also decided to adjust his lifestyle choices by reducing his alcohol intake  incorporating more physical activity into his daily routine  and has sought a consultation with a nutritionist for a healthier diet plan. His commitment to lifestyle modifications will hopefully contribute to the prevention of further episodes of DVT. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,32,Patient Presentation  Mr. Johnson is a 57-year-old African-American male diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) discovered after he reported significant swelling and pain in his left leg. He resides in New York City and works as an IT consultant  which invariably implies long hours of desk work. Johnson is also a frequent traveler  considering his job's nature.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson's medical history includes hypertension managed with prescription medication. Johnson is overweight  and his Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29 places him within the obesity range. In addition  he has Type 2 diabetes mellitus that he manages with oral hypoglycemic medication. However  his last HbA1C nine months prior had read 6.3%  indicating not so satisfactory glycemic control. Other crucial features of his medical history include a sedentary lifestyle and high-stress levels - both from work and in managing his two teenage children after a recent divorce.  Family History:  Johnson's mother was diagnosed with DVT at the age of 62  and she died due to a pulmonary embolism  a potential complication of DVT. His father  who is now 86  has a history of heart disease.  Diagnosis:  Upon examination  Johnson's left leg appeared swollen  and palpation revealed tenderness along with the path of the major veins. A venous duplex scan was done which confirmed a non-compressible left superficial femoral vein  indicative of a clot. The tests confirmed the diagnosis of Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Management and Intervention:  Mr. Johnson was prescribed with anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin and bridged to warfarin with the intention of long-term anticoagulation. He has been advised on lifestyle modifications pertaining to weight control  increased physical activities  and managing mental stress. He was also referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.  Future Risk and Prevention:  Given the patient's history  his risk of a recurrent DVT is high. He's being educated on the signs and symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism  and he's strongly endorsed to sustain a healthy lifestyle including weight control  regular exercise  and quitting a sedentary lifestyle. He has also been recommended routine follow-ups to check on his coagulation profile and other physiological parameters.  Educational aspects for similar patients:  Patient education about the risks of DVT  early detection signs  importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes should be encouraged  especially among patients with risk factors such as family history  prolonged periods of immobility  obesity  chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.  This case highlights the strong correlation between lifestyle factors and the development of conditions such as DVT. Hence  it emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach in disease management  which includes not only pharmacological interventions but also lifestyle modifications  patient education and awareness.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,33,Patient Information:    A 70-year old African-American male.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He complains of pain and swelling in the right lower limb that has been ongoing for a week. The patient also admits to increased warmth and redness of the affected limb.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril. He was also recently hospitalized for a total knee replacement procedure on the affected limb  6 weeks prior to present symptoms.  Social History:  The patient is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and is a non-smoker. He drinks alcohol moderately. He walks twice a week with his community's senior citizen's walking group.  Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father passing away at the age of 68 due to myocardial infarction. His mother had a stroke at the age of 74 but is currently alive and well. He has a younger brother currently suffering from heart failure.  Examination:  On physical examination  his blood pressure was 160/90 mm/Hg and his pulse was regular at 84 beats per minute. His BMI (Body Mass Index) is 26. Swelling was noted in the right lower limb with warmth  erythema  and tenderness along the calf muscle. Pedal pulses were present and equal bilaterally.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed a raised D-dimer level. Doppler Ultrasound of the right lower limb confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the deep veins of the calf  thus confirming the diagnosis of DVT.  Discussion:  The patient's advanced age  recent surgery  and immobility have likely contributed to the development of DVT in this case. The management plan has been set to include anticoagulation therapy with factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban  as the first-line treatment of DVT. Patient education on the importance of regular exercises  lifestyle modifications  and compliance to medication was also emphasized.  Prognosis:  With appropriate management  prognosis in DVT can be fairly good. However  vigilance is required in this case given the patient's family history of cardiovascular disease and personal history of hypertension.  Plan:  Continued outpatient management with Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban  regular monitoring  and re-evaluation. Regular exercises and lifestyle modifications have also been advised. The patient is asked to return in 4 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.   This case presentation summarises the relevant points of a patient with DVT. It does  however  simplify a complex clinical process and should be used as a guide rather than a comprehensive analysis. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,34,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  (considering that Caucasians are more likely to develop DVT according to literature)  who is retired and living with his wife. He is presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling in the right calf  which he initially thought was musculoskeletal in nature. Upon further investigation  with venous Doppler ultrasound  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was confirmed.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history reveals that he is a former smoker with quit 10 years ago. He has a history of obesity  hypertension  and high cholesterol for which he is on medication (Simvastatin for cholesterol and Lisinopril for hypertension). He had a knee replacement surgery approximately 15 months ago. The patient also had a remote history of a transient ischemic attack 4 years ago with no residual neurological deficits. No known drug allergies have been reported.  Family History:  The family history is significant for cardiovascular disorders. His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his maternal uncle had a stroke in his early 70s. There is no known family history of blood clotting disorders or cancer.  Social History:  He is retired. His wife reported that he has been less active over the last three months due to winter weather. He denies alcohol use  is a former smoker with quit from 10 years  and does not use recreational drugs. There's no travel history or history of prolonged immobilization.  Evaluation:  On examination  his blood pressure was 145/92 mm Hg  heart rate 78 beats per minute and regular  and he had a normal temperature and respiratory rate. The right lower leg was slightly swollen compared to the left  and it was warm to touch. There was tenderness in the calf muscles. No signs of any skin changes or ulcers.  Conclusion:  Given the patient's clinical presentation and risk factors  including age  obesity  recent inactivity  hypertension  and family history of cardiovascular disease  deep vein thrombosis was suspected and confirmed with a Doppler ultrasound. The patient was subsequently started on anticoagulation therapy.  The patient's primary care doctor was informed about his condition for follow up and for reassessment of the management of his hypertension  possible statin treatment considering his high risk  and lifestyle modification advice includes diet and increasing physical activity.   Overall  the early diagnosis and prompt treatment of DVT in this patient is vital to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome  and recurrent DVT. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,35,Presentation:  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with symptoms of swelling  warmth  pain  and reddening of the lower left leg. She denies any recent surgery or trauma but mentions a transcontinental flight about two weeks ago.  Medical history:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  conditions that are managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. In addition  she is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but had a 30-pack year smoking history. Lastly  she reveals past incidents of prolonged immobility due to her nature of work in a sedentary job where she often worked long desk-bound hours.  Complete demographics:  The patient is in her late 60s  unmarried  and lives alone. She's retired from a profession in computer programming for the last five years. Despite living alone  she has a well-established support network among her friends and neighbors. She doesn't have any children and doesn't engage in any active physical exercise. She is of standard weight for her height (BMI of 25) and lives in a suburban community.  Family history:  Her family history includes a mother who suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and a father who died from a stroke at 80. Both her parents had hypertension. She also has one younger brother in his early 60s  who is currently being treated for type II diabetes.   Diagnosis and Discussion:  Based on the patient’s symptoms  her past medical history  her sedentary lifestyle  her prolonged period of immobility during the flight  and her family history  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was considered. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis by revealing a thrombus in her left lower limb veins.  Patients like her are particularly at risk for DVT due to her age  history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  her sedentary lifestyle  and previous smoking history. The prolonged immobilization during her flight also contributed to her DVT risk.   Treatment:  Treatment will involve anticoagulant medications to prevent further clot formation and potential progression into pulmonary embolism  which could be lethal. Moreover  a lifestyle modification will be strongly advised  including a regular physical activity regimen and maintenance of a healthy diet.  Outcome:  With the correct treatment and lifestyle modifications  the outcome can be positive. However  the patient should be closely monitored to prevent complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and recurrence of DVT. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to ensure drug compliance and monitor the patient’s response to the treatment  offering adjustment when required. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,36,Patient Presentation:  Subject: John  a 65-year-old African-American male  Presenting Condition: Patient reports of increasing pain and swelling in the right calf over the past week  accompanied by mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: John has a medical history significant for hypertension  obesity (BMI = 35)  type-2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia for which he takes oral medications regularly. He is a former chain smoker and quit smoking ten years ago.   Family History: Patient’s father died at the age of 72 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother suffered from type-2 diabetes and hypertension.  Social History: He is a retired plumber  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He reports being moderately active  exercising intermittently  and admits to a diet high in saturated fats and carbohydrates.  Examination: On examination  his right calf was found to be markedly swollen  warm  and tender compared to the left  displaying symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His vital signs were stable. Oxygen saturation was observed to be slightly below normal.  Diagnostic Assessment: John was immediately subjected to an ultrasound which revealed a thrombus in the right popliteal vein. A D-dimer test was also positive. An EKG tested normal  although a subsequent chest CT showed small peripheral lung emboli  indicative of a pulmonary embolism (PE).  Management Plan: The diagnosis of DVT  complicated by PE  was explained to John. He was initiated on anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin and subsequent warfarin. The patient was also counseled on lifestyle modifications including weight loss  increased mobility  and dietary changes to manage his BMI  and indirectly  his diabetes and hypertension.   Discussion: The risk of DVT and PE is significantly higher in patients with obesity and diabetes. As a smoking cessation is a protective factor for thrombosis  John’s prior history of smoking might have put him at risk. Additionally  African-Americans have been observed to show a higher prevalence rate for DVT and PE than the general population. Appropriate referral for John’s hypertension and diabetes management may reduce the chances of DVT reoccurrence in future.   This case emphasizes the importance of considering genetic  personal and social factors  in not only the diagnosis but also in the management of complex conditions such as DVT and PE.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,37,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient Identification: The patient  Ms. N.O.  is a 63-year-old African-American female residing in Washington  D.C.  Chief Complaint: Ms. N.O. came to the hospital with a complaint of progressive swelling and notable discomfort in her left lower extremity over the past week.  Past Medical History (PMH): Ms. N.O. has two significant diagnoses on record - Hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago) and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Diagnosed 8 years ago). She has been taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for her hypertension and Metformin 1000mg twice daily for her diabetes. Also  it is noteworthy that she was on estrogen-based Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) due to severe post-menopausal symptoms over three years ago.   Family History: Demographic trends suggest African Americans have a higher risk for DVT. Her family history is positive for cardiovascular diseases; her father died at the age of 67 due to heart failure  and her elder sister was diagnosed with DVT two years ago.   Social History: The patient revealed she is a non-smoker  and consumes a moderate amount of alcohol occasionally. She lives alone following the death of her husband and is sedentary largely due to her job as a remote customer service representative.  Current Examination: On physical examination  Ms. N.O.’s left calf showed notable swelling and was warm to touch compared to the other. She also exhibited tenderness on palpation. A noticeable Homan's sign (pain on dorsiflexion of her foot) was present. BMI calculation was 32  which indicates obesity.  Imaging and Diagnostics: A Doppler ultrasound was performed  which confirmed the presence of a clot in the lower left leg vein corroborating the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Laboratory studies further revealed elevated D-dimer levels.  Case Impression: Ms. N.O's case denotes multiple risk factors contributing to her condition of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): her age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  history of estrogen-based HRT and African-American ethnicity. Further  her co-morbidities including hypertension and diabetes implicitly increase her risk for DVT. Considering her family history  a genetic predisposition for thrombosis can also be speculated.  Plan: Currently  she has been started on anticoagulation therapy under close monitoring. We are planning to customize an exercise program to increase her mobility and help manage her weight. Further counseling on lifestyle modification  including dietary changes and importance of regular follow-up  is scheduled. Genetic screening may be considered to ascertain hereditary thrombophilia due to the positive family history of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,38,Patient Profile:   Mr. Smith  a 62-year-old African-American male  a resident of suburban Texas  was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  after two days of experiencing a sudden onset of unilateral leg swelling and discomfort.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,39,Patient Presentation: The patient  referred to as Mr. J  is a 68-year-old African-American male with a recent diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Culturally  a statistically higher prevalence of DVT has been observed in African-American individuals when compared to other races. Mr. J presented with symptoms of unilateral lower extremity pain  swelling  redness  and warmth near the site of pain.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and hypertension  both of which have been managed with diet  exercise  prescribed medication  and regular follow-up with his healthcare provider. He also has a past medical history of smoking for about 25 years but quit ten years ago.  Family History: Mr. J's mother had a history of DVT  and his father  while having escaped DVT  battled coronary artery diseases.  Complete Demographics: Mr. J is a retired principal living with his wife in a suburban area. They have two children  both of whom live independently. As he is coupled  retired  and economically stable  he can invest time in managing his health. However  due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions  he has been markedly less physically active  which likely raised his risk for DVT.  Additional Information: Mr. J reports having undergone surgery for a herniated disc three weeks ago and has been mostly bed-ridden during his recovery period. His immobility post-surgery has likely contributed to his DVT. At the time of his diagnosis  he was not on any anticoagulant therapy.  While Mr. J’s long-term diabetes and hypertension are concern points  it is the recent surgery that likely triggered the DVT. Postoperative immobility can slow blood flow  making clots more likely to form. With the typical demographic risk factors  and in addition  strong family history  and underlying chronic diseases  Mr. J needs to be immediately started on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation. Patient education on weight management  increased physical activity  and dietary modifications may also help mitigate his overall risks. Regular monitoring and follow-up is necessary in this patient's case to prevent complications and make sure the therapeutic regimen is effective.

She has two children who are living out of the state and is generally sedentary with minimal physical activity.  Medical History  Mrs. O was diagnosed with type II diabetes eight years ago. She has managed her condition well with medication  Metformin  diet  and exercise  although her recent activity level has been minimal. Five years ago she was diagnosed with hypertension  for which she takes Lisinopril. She has no history of surgeries.  Her social history reveals that she has smoked half a pack per day for the past 40 years  occasionally consumes alcohol  and has no known drug history. She admits to having a relatively sedentary lifestyle and has a family history of thromboembolic disease; her mother had a pulmonary embolism at the age of 72.   Present Medical Condition  Her current condition started two weeks ago with mild pain in the left leg  which she initially attributed to an overlooked strain but worsened over time. Accompanied by swelling  her left leg appeared red and warm to touch. She denied fever  chest pain  or respiratory symptoms. Upon examination  Homan's sign was positive. Because of her symptoms and history  a Doppler ultrasonography was performed  confirming the presence of deep vein thrombosis in her left lower limb.  Acknowledging her prior medical history and lifestyle  her prolonged periods of inactivity  coupled with her hypertension  diabetic condition  and genetic predisposition  have likely contributed to her recent DVT diagnosis. She has been advised to stop smoking  increase activity levels  wear compression stockings  and has been prescribed anticoagulant therapy with Warfarin to prevent clot propagation and reduce the risk of further complications such as pulmonary embolism.  Plan  Close follow-ups and regular monitoring of her INR are essential to ensure effective anticoagulation and to avoid complications such as bleeding and recurrence of DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,48,Patient Profile  We are discussing Mr. Smith  a 67-year-old African American male with a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents at the outpatient clinic complaining of swelling  warmth  and persistent pain in his right lower leg that has gradually worsened over the last week.  Past Medical History  His past medical history includes a diagnosis of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. His hypertension and diabetes have been controlled with antihypertensive (Lisinopril 10mg daily) and oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin 500mg twice daily) respectively. His LDL level remains slightly elevated (latest 120 mg/dL) despite being on Atorvastatin 20mg per day.  Family History  His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His mother had a myocardial infarction at 75 years of age  and his father had a stroke in his early 70s. Mr. Smith has two younger brothers  one of whom has hypertension  and the other is a diabetic. None of his close relatives has a history of deep vein thrombosis.  Social History  Mr. Smith is a retired engineer  married with three adult children. He quit smoking 15 years ago and occasionally drinks alcohol. He does not engage in regular physical activity and admits to a sedentary lifestyle  especially after his retirement.   Clinical Presentation  Upon physical examination  the patient's right lower leg appeared swollen and erythematous. The calf was tender to palpation  and a positive Homan's sign was present. Vitals were stable except for mildly elevated blood pressure (145/90mmHg).  Clinical Investigation  A Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb demonstrated obstructive thrombus in the popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. His D-dimer levels were markedly elevated. The rest of his complete blood count  renal function  and blood glucose levels were satisfactory.    Management  Considering his risk factors  a hypocoagulant treatment was initiated with Low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin)  and transitioning him to oral anticoagulants (Warfarin) is planned in the subsequent days. Compression stockings were also suggested along with lifestyle modifications which include staying active  maintaining a healthy weight  and increased mobility.   Given Mr. Smith’s recent diagnosis of DVT  his sedentary lifestyle  age  race  and family history could possibly contribute as risk factors. Considering hypertension and diabetes add to the predisposition of DVT events  attention should be given to the management of these conditions and patient education on the risks associated. Future plans involve monitoring his response to treatment  reviewing anticoagulant therapy  and ensuring his risk factors are managed effectively. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,49,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 60 years  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Accountant  History: Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old retired accountant  diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He is physically inactive  primarily living a sedentary lifestyle  and has been a smoker for the past 40 years with a 30 pack-year smoking history. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II. He has been treated for his hypertension and diabetes. Recently  he underwent a total knee arthroplasty.   Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and his mother suffered from type II diabetes. His younger brother was diagnosed with DVT few years back.   Present Illness: Mr. Johnson was admitted to the hospital presenting severe pain in his left leg. The leg was swollen  warm  and with redness suggesting inflammation. The patient reported feeling a heavy ache and warmth  symptoms consistent with a DVT diagnosis.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  his blood pressure was slightly elevated  and his body mass index qualified him as obese. His left leg was notably swollen in comparison to the right  showing signs of pitting edema.  Diagnostic Tests: D-dimer test was positive; an ultrasound confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep vein of his left leg.

Social History:  Mr. X is a retired engineer living with his wife in a suburban community. He leads a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activities.   Physical Examination:  Physical examination showed an elevated blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. Mr. X's respiratory rate was slightly elevated at 18 breaths/minute  and he appeared slightly anxious. His right lower calf was swollen and warm to touch  with noticeable erythema compared to the left one.   Clinical Assessment:  The patient's history and physical examination pointed towards the likelihood of DVT. Diagnosis was confirmed through a Doppler ultrasound which revealed a clot in the right popliteal vein. Blood tests further showed that the D-dimer levels were elevated  which is consistent with DVT.   Laboratory Findings:  - Elevated D-Dimer: 1500 ng/ml (normal: <500 ng/ml) - Fasting blood glucose: 200 mg/dl - Blood pressure: 145/90 mmHg  Management:  The patient was put on an intravenous heparin drip for immediate anticoagulation  with a transition plan to oral anticoagulants (warfarin) for long-term management. Lifestyle modifications  including regular exercise  salt restriction  and close monitoring of blood glucose levels  were advised as part of the comprehensive treatment approach.  In conclusion  this is a case of a 65-year-old male with a history of prior cardiovascular disease who presented with acute DVT  possibly exacerbated by his recent sedentary lifestyle due to retirement and unmonitored blood sugar levels. Prevention strategies  along with a comprehensive management plan  are being implemented.   Building further on this patient case  it's important to consider potential overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms between his DVT  heart disease  and diabetes  and how future interventions can address these risk factors effectively.

Presenting Complaints: Completing the routine errands has been challenging for him as he increasingly experiences significant discomfort in his right leg. He describes it as a persistent ‘aching pain ’ accompanied by swelling around his calf muscle for the past 10 days.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Moreover  he underwent an uncomplicated right hip replacement surgery six weeks ago after a fall in his home. He has been managing his hypertension and high cholesterol with medications. He is a former smoker and quit 15 years ago.   Family History: He reported a strong family history of cardiovascular disease: his father died of a heart attack at 72 and his elder brother  currently 74  is recovering from a stroke. There are no other significant familial diseases.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  I found tenderness  redness  warmth and swelling in his right calf and ankle indicating pitting edema. The Homans’ sign was positive. His blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg and other vitals were stable.   Diagnosis: Based on his recent orthopedic surgery  symptoms  risk factors  a positive Homans’ sign and D-dimer test  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. Subsequent Doppler ultrasound confirmed this.  Treatment Plan: We started him on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin. His antihypertensive and statin medication were continued and adjusted considering the new therapy.  Conclusion: The risk factor in Mr. J's case is his recent surgery  his age  race  family history of heart disease  and his chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He falls into the high-risk category for DVT  illustrating the importance of prophylactic measures in high-risk patients  particularly during post-surgical periods.  Community health nurses should educate these at risk patients with DVT signs  symptoms  and the importance of immediate medical attention. Healthcare providers should integrate individual risk assessments before surgery  and ensure postoperative anticoagulation prophylaxis is appropriately provided to prevent DVT incidence whenever required.

Because of his medical history  he has high risk factors for developing DVT  including hypertension  diabetes  and previous surgery.   An interdisciplinary approach will be used in managing his case involving the primary physicians  endocrinologists for the diabetes  dieticians for weight and diabetes management  and physiotherapists to help with mobilization and exercise. The patient will also need to undergo lifestyle modification  including diet changes and regular light exercise. This is to ensure proper management of his presenting condition and underlying comorbidities.  Patient education will be crucial in this case. He will need to understand the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle changes to prevent the recurrence of DVT or any other related complications.   The patient will be closely monitored  and routine follow-ups will be required to assess the progress and effectiveness of his treatment plan.   References: 1) Heit JA et al.  (2017).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,54,Patient Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile:  The patient is Mr. X  a 65-year-old African American male  residing in the city of Chicago. He is a retired factory worker with no adequate exercise routine and has been a pack-a-day smoker for roughly 45 years. He is overweight with a BMI of 29. His diet is high in fats and sugars  and he has a moderate alcohol intake. His socioeconomic status is lower-middle class.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both currently managed through medication. He had an acute myocardial infarction five years ago. His last check-up was three months ago  and all the vital parameters were within normal limits. Mr. X has no history of any surgical procedures.  Family History:  Both his father and grandfather succumbed to heart diseases in their late 60s. His mother is alive and has type II Diabetes Mellitus. He has an elder sister who is diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. X presented with complaints of swelling  tenderness  and pain in his left lower leg that has been persistent for the past few days. There is no history of trauma or injury. On further probing  he also admitted to slight difficulty in breathing when performing daily activities  which he initially attributed to his smoking habit.  Examination & Diagnostic Findings:  Clinical examination revealed observable edema in his left leg  which was markedly warmer than the other. His breathing was shallow but within safe range. Based on the symptoms and risk factors  a Doppler ultrasound was performed which confirmed the suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein.  Conclusion:  Considering the patient's history  lifestyle  and age with the recent cardiovascular complication  he is categorized as high risk for DVT. The critical concern in such a situation is the risk of pulmonary embolism  which was corroborated by the onset of breathing difficulty. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and management  including anticoagulant therapy. Long term plan includes effective lifestyle modifications – quitting smoking  adopting a healthier diet  and incorporating regular exercise for weight management.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,55,Patient Identification:  A 58-year-old African American male  employed as a long-haul truck driver.  Chief Complaint: The patient visits the ER complaining of swelling and discomfort in his left leg.  Present Illness History: The patient states the swelling has been progressing for the past few days  accompanied by a slight ache and warmth over the area. He denies any injury or trauma to the leg but confesses to long hours of driving with minimal chances for regular mobility.  Past Medical History: He reports hypertension (high blood pressure) diagnosed ten years ago  for which he is on medication (Lisinopril). He admits to intermittent compliance with his medication use. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed five years ago  managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. No history of other chronic illnesses or surgeries.  Medications: As mentioned  Lisinopril for hypertension and metformin for type 2 diabetes.   Family History: Both parents passed away due to heart disease. His older brother has diabetes  and his younger sister has been diagnosed with breast cancer.  Social History: Married with 3 children. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for about 30 years. He denies any alcohol or drug abuse and there's no known history of exposure to any allergens or toxins. His occupation involves long hours of driving with limited physical activity.  Examination: Physical examination reveals an edematous  warm  and slightly tender left lower limb. The overlying skin is intact. The right lower limb is normal on inspection and palpation. No other significant findings on general physical and systemic examination.  Other Relevant Data: Blood pressure on admission: 160/100 mm Hg Random blood sugar on admission: 180 mg/dl  Diagnosis and Clinical Course: An ultrasound Doppler study of the left leg revealed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with an injection of low molecular weight heparin  followed by oral warfarin therapy.  Summary and Planning: Considering the pronounced thrombus and his known risk factors: fixed position during work  history of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes  this patient's case is not surprising. Management will include continued anticoagulation for several months. In addition  he must be educated on lifestyle changes  including weight loss if his BMI is too high  regular exercise  and most importantly  taking frequent short breaks during driving for mobility. Long term  he must work on definitive cessation of smoking and control his blood pressure and blood sugar. The patient's case signifies the impact of lifestyle choices on venous thromboembolism risk. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,56,Patient Overview:  Our patient  Mr. John Carlsen  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  living with his wife in suburban New York. He is a retired engineer with a long sedentary history in his working environment. Over the years  Mr. Carlsen has been relatively inactive with limited physical workouts. He has been indulging in a moderately healthy diet and is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption.  Presenting Symptoms & Diagnosis: Mr. Carlsen presented to the hospital with complaints of progressive swelling and pain in his right lower extremity  particularly in the calf region  over the previous week. His symptoms have progressively worsened over time. On examination  the right calf was swollen  warm  and tender. There was also evident pitting edema. Given these symptoms and risk factors  he was investigated and diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Past Medical & Family History: Mr. Carlsen has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are well-controlled with medication. He does not have any known allergies and has never undergone major surgery. As it relates to his family history  his father died of a stroke at the age of 79 and his mother died of a heart attack at the age of 76.  Risk Factors: Mr. Carlsen falls into the increased risk group for DVT  primarily due to his age  sedentary lifestyle  history of hypertension  and diabetes. In the Western population  the incidence of DVT is higher in those over 60  specifically with a male predominance. Furthermore  research shows individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of thrombosis.   Plan: Anticoagulant therapy has been initiated promptly. The first-line treatment choice for DVT is typically low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in conjunction with a Vitamin K antagonist like warfarin. Mr. Carlsen has been advised to increase his physical activity and maintain a balanced diet to manage his weight. His progress will be monitored closely and follow-up appointments have been scheduled.  In summary  Mr. Carlsen's case illustrates the risk associated with venous thromboembolism in the elderly population with a sedentary lifestyle and comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Early detection and effective management are crucial in preventing major complications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,57,Patient Profile: The patient  Mr. Rodriguez  is a 68-year-old Hispanic male hailing from San Antonio  Texas. He has been living with his wife and two grown-up children in the state for over 40 years. Rodriguez is a retired construction worker and has been categorized as overweight based on his Body Mass Index (BMI). The family's socioeconomic status is classified as middle class.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Rodriguez presented at the clinic reporting fatigue  swelling  and pain in his right leg for the past five days  which have aggravated over the past day making it concerning for him and his family.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He had a Myocardial Infarction three years ago  managed medically at the same hospital  and smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years.  Family Medical History: The patient's father died due to a stroke at the age of 72  and his mother passed away from diabetes-related complications at the age of 78. His elder brother had Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 65. His younger sister is living with type II diabetes and hypertension. His two children are currently healthy with no significant medical issues.  Examination and Diagnostic Evaluation: On examination  his right calf was tender  warm  and swollen as compared to the left one. Blood pressure was found to be elevated at 150/95 mmHg. Random blood glucose was recorded at 200 mg/dL. Doppler ultrasonography of the right leg revealed a deep venous thrombosis in the right calf veins.  Diagnosis:  Based on his clinical presentation and Doppler ultrasonography findings  Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Considering his chronic history of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and his past cardiovascular event  he had significant risk factors for DVT. His cigarette smoking and family history might have accelerated the process leading to his current condition.   Management and Treatment Plan: Mr. Rodriguez was admitted to the hospital and was started on anticoagulation therapy with a low molecular weight heparin  specifically Enoxaparin. Meanwhile  his diabetes was managed with insulin and his hypertension with Calcium Channel blockers. Nicotine replacement therapy was initiated for cigarette smoking cessation. His condition will be closely monitored  ensuring he receives adequate treatment based on improvements or deterioration in his condition.  Plan for Follow-up:  Mr. Rodriguez will be discharged when PT/INR value reaches the desired level. He would be prescribed long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. Lifestyle modifications including dietary modification  weight loss  and smoking cessation will be emphasized. Regular follow-up after discharge  which includes monitoring INR levels  blood pressure  and blood glucose  will be scheduled. Mr. Rodriguez and his family will also be educated about the importance of medication adherence and outpatient follow-up care.  In conclusion  Mr. Rodriguez's case highlights the importance of managing multiple comorbidities effectively  since poorly controlled chronic diseases add to an individual's risk for vascular complications  such as DVT. His case also exemplifies the impact of lifestyle practices  such as smoking  on vascular health and underlines the importance of lifestyle modifications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,58,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 68-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and a 10-year history of tobacco use (smoker). He was brought in by his daughter to the local emergency room upon noticing swelling and pain in his left leg which has been progressively worsening over the past two days. His daughter also mentioned his recent long-haul flight about six days ago. Mr. Johnson is retired  lives with his wife  and is originally from the Midwest.  Medical History:  Besides the already mentioned comorbidities  he reported an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) seven years ago  with good recovery and no complications since then. He is on regular medications such as Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Crestor for his elevated cholesterol levels. He also uses aspirin following his TIA. He denies any known allergies.  Family History:  His father died from a heart attack at the age of 65  while his mother died at 70 from a stroke. His younger brother  now 65  is currently living with heart disease. There exists a strong family history of cardiovascular disorders and hypertension.  On physical examination:  He was found to be in mild distress due to leg pain. His vital signs showed blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 85 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  O2 saturation 97% on room air  and a temperature of 98.6°F. Lower extremity examination showed swelling  redness  tenderness  and warmth over the left calf area with a positive Homan's Sign.  Investigations:  D-dimer level was considerably elevated  and a venous Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep venous system  diagnosing him with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Clinical Impression:  Considering Mr.Johnson’s already high-risk profile (due to hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes)  his previous smoking history  a recent long-haul flight  and a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  these factors have likely predisposed him to developing DVT. Immediate anticoagulation treatment was initiated and smoking cessation counselling was provided. A referral to a Vascular Specialist for outpatient follow-up was arranged. A comprehensive plan for lifestyle modifications was also discussed for long-term management of his chronic illnesses which might reduce future thrombotic risks.  Demographic Trends:  This case falls in line with epidemiological data that suggests DVT is more common in those aged over 60  those with comorbid conditions such as heart disease and diabetes  and in people with a history of smoking. African-American men  like Mr. Johnson  have been found to be at a slightly higher risk of DVT compared to their Caucasian counterparts. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,59,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 60-year-old African American male with a history of type II diabetes  hypertension  and obesity presents to the clinic with complaints of pain and swelling in his left calf for the past several days. He describes the pain as constant  cramp-like  and increasing in severity. There is no history of recent trauma or injury. He has no known allergies and takes metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension. Recent physical activity has been limited due to COVID-19 lockdown measures. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or cough.   Demographics: Mr. Smith is a retired veteran living with his wife in an urban area. He has a history of smoking (1 pack/day for 20 years  quit 15 years ago). He consumes alcohol occasionally  generally limited to holidays and is not engaged in regular physical activity. His nutritional choices are poor  often favoring fast food due to its convenience.  Family History: His father had a history of myocardial infarction at an early age and his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. None known for thrombotic or clotting disorders.  Clinical Examination: On the physical examination  Mr. Smith is obese (BMI- 32)  with a BP of 145/90 mmHg  pulse 82/min and regular  and respiratory rate of 18  regular with oxygen saturation 98% at room air. The left calf is visibly swollen and warm with mild erythema compared to the right. Palpation reveals tenderness along the course of the left posterior tibial and popliteal veins. The rest of the cardiac  pulmonary and abdominal examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Venous Doppler ultrasound study of the left lower extremity shows evidence of an intraluminal clot in the left popliteal vein. A D-Dimer test was also high.   Diagnosis: The diagnosis of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is made based on clinical symptoms and Ultrasound findings and supported by high D-Dimer level.  Plan: 1) To start anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)  as per current guidelines. 2) As outpatient management is possible  educate the patient and caregivers about the signs of DVT and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and when to seek further help. 3) Encourage lifestyle modifications like healthier nutritional choices  regular physical activity  and maintaining optimal weight. 4) Refer to a dietitian and a physical therapist. 5) Regular follow-ups for monitoring coagulation status and adverse effects of anticoagulants. 6) Coordinate care with his primary care practitioner to optimize control of his diabetes and hypertension.  7) Long-term management will be with oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 3 months  after which the decision to continue therapy will be based on his risk for recurrence.   General demographic information has been illustrated as per statistical representation in real-life scenarios.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,60,Patient Overview: J. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the emergency department complaining of severe pain and swelling in his right leg below the knee. The patient works as a truck driver and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He admits to a heavy smoking habit (a pack a day) and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and grandfather having had myocardial infarctions in their sixties.   Past medical history: Mr. Smith has been previously diagnosed with obesity (BMI 35)  hypertension  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he has been managing with oral antidiabetic medication  glycemic control diet  and antihypertensive medication respectively. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia but has been non-compliant with statin therapy. Despite multiple consultations from his primary care physician  Mr. Smith has not significantly changed his lifestyle or smoking habits. He has no known drug allergies.  Present Complaint: Mr. Smith presents with a 3-day history of worsening  unilateral leg pain  and swelling. He noted the onset after a long truck drive. Also  there is discoloration of the leg and warmth over the swelling area. He denies having chest pain  shortness of breath  or any previous episodes of similar symptoms.  Examination: On examination  his vitals are stable  but his right leg appears notably swollen  erythematous  and warmer than the left. A palpable cord is felt along the course of the deep veins. A Homan's sign was positive. His remaining physical examination was unremarkable.  Lab findings: His blood work shows D-dimer levels exceed the normal range at 750 ng/mL (normal range 0-500ng/mL). An ultrasound Doppler study confirmed a thrombus in the right popliteal vein  confirming the deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Treatment: Mr. Smith has been treated with low molecular weight Heparin (Enoxaparin) in the emergency room. He was then switched over to oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban) with suggestions for lifestyle changes and therapeutic exercises. He has been given advice regarding compression stockings  leg elevation exercises  and the importance of regular movements to avoid prolonged immobilization.   Conclusion: Mr. Smith's case is a common presentation of deep vein thrombosis  which is often associated with prolonged immobilization  obesity  and smoking. His past medical history places him at high risk for DVT. His management involves both pharmacological intervention to resolve the current DVT and lifestyle changes to mitigate future risks. Patient education regarding his condition and the importance of adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications form an integral part of his management plan. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,61,Case Presentation:  Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Barbara Jones.  Presenting complaint: Mrs. Jones was admitted to the hospital for severe leg pain and visible swelling in her left lower limb.   History of presenting complaint: She has been experiencing discomfort in her left leg for the past 2 ½ weeks. She described the pain as a constant dull ache made worse by walking or standing for long periods.  Past medical history: Five years ago  Mrs. Jones was prescribed warfarin for atrial fibrillation. She has been taking the medication as prescribed without any side effects. In addition  she was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes 10 years ago but is under good control with diet and Metformin. She had a transient ischemic attack about two years ago but thankfully had no detrimental residual effects.   Social History: Mrs. Jones is a retired teacher living with her husband of 45 years. She used to smoke in her younger days but quit 30 years ago. She admits to having a glass of wine with dinner. She leads an active lifestyle despite her age but has been less mobile recently due to leg pain.  Family History:  Both of her parents died in their 80s—her mother from stroke and her father from colon cancer. Her older brother is alive and has a history of heart disease and her sister died from breast cancer at age 60.  Examination: Physical examination revealed a visibly swollen and warm left lower limb. Her leg was tender to touch  particularly in the calf  and the limb was reddish-purple in color. Range of motion was limited due to pain and swelling.   Investigations: An ultrasound Doppler was ordered which confirmed the presence of a clot in the left popliteal vein  indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Issues/Presentation: Mrs. Jones is at an increased risk for DVT due to her age and history of atrial fibrillation which was being treated with warfarin. Being less mobile due to pain is a known risk factor for DVT as well. Her left-sided DVT requires immediate management to prevent possible complications  like pulmonary embolism. The risks and benefits of changes to her current anticoagulation therapy will need to be carefully weighed and explained.  We can infer that Mrs. Jones' age  history of atrial fibrillation  transient ischemic attack  type-2 diabetes  and recent immobility are predisposing factors for her DVT  and her management will have to be planned accordingly to prevent it from recurring or causing further complications. Her family history of heart disease and stroke together with personal medical history call for continuous monitoring and preventative interventions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Z  a male aged 62 years from a suburban background came to ER with complaints of pain  swelling  and redness of his left lower leg for the past one week. He is a Caucasian male. He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which were being managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. Apart from these  he also has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32. He denies history of any surgery or immobilization for prolonged periods and any recent travel. He has no known drug allergies.  He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and consumes alcohol socially. Until recently  he used to work in a setup where he had a sedentary lifestyle. Until the symptoms worsened ahead of his ER visit  patient's physical activity was severely limited due to his workload.  His family history reveals that his father had suffered from myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his elder sister was undergoing treatment for pulmonary embolism. There was no history of malignancy  diabetes mellitus or any inherited coagulation disorders in the family.   On closer examination  Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity was performed which confirmed deep vein thrombosis in the left posterior tibial vein. No signs of pulmonary embolism were presented.   Initial laboratory tests suggested raised levels of D-dimer. Complete blood picture  liver function test  renal function test and other routine investigations were within normal limits.   Considering the patient history and clinical findings  he was diagnosed with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated and was found to be 3 (1 for age above 65  1 for hypertension and 1 for vascular disease)  and HAS-BLED score was 2 (1 for hypertension and 1 for excessive alcohol intake)  suggesting high risk of both stroke and bleed.   The presence of unprovoked DVT along with a positive family history signaled towards a possible inherited thrombophilia  which needed further investigations.   In conclusion  Mr. Z’s complaint required an urgent yet precise approach due to his condition making him vulnerable especially with his past medical history  personal habits and family history. The healthcare professionals managed to evaluate Mr. Z with a timely diagnosis and created a treatment plan for his deep vein thrombosis which included anticoagulation therapy along with lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  healthy diet  quitting smoking and alcohol consumption.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,63,Patient Presentation  The patient under review is a 57-year-old Caucasian female named Lisa. She hails from Miami  Florida  where she lived alone  active in her profession as an accountant. With a BMI of 29.5  she is presently overweight.   Past Medical History  Lisa's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both effectively managed with medication for the past ten years. She had undergone a hysterectomy 15 years ago due to the emergence of benign fibroids. Her latest complete blood count  lipid profile  and liver function tests were all within normal ranges. Smoker for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. There is no history of drug or alcohol use.  Family History   Lisa’s family history is significant for heart disease; her father suffered from myocardial infarction at 65  and her younger brother has recently been diagnosed with early-onset coronary artery disease. They both have a history of cigarette smoking. Her mother is alive and relatively healthy at 85  with arthritis being her only significant health issue.   Presenting Problem  Lisa presented with an unusually swollen  painful left leg that started roughly two days ago. The pain is characterized as being constant  especially when maneuvering the step. There was no associated trauma or injury. Over-the-counter medications provided no respite. Reports associated mild shortness of breath  for the last day  that worsens at rest  but no chest pain or palpitations.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  Lisa's left leg was visibly swollen and warm to the touch as compared to her right leg. She exhibited a positive Homans' sign indicative of DVT. Her pain was aggravated on dorsiflexion of her left foot. The finding of an enlarged tender calf muscle  a sign of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was noted. Her heart rate was slightly elevated at 98 bpm  but her blood pressure was within normal range. ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right ventricular strain.   Working Diagnosis  Considering Lisa’s age  family history  non-mobile work nature  and her present symptoms and clinical findings  a tentative diagnosis of Left lower extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was made.  Further Diagnostic Steps and Treatments   Lisa was advised to undergo a Doppler ultrasound of her lower extremities to confirm the diagnosis of DVT. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was initiated immediately to prevent clot propagation  and arrangements were made for oral anticoagulation therapy. Lisa was also educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications  weight management  and regular physical activities for long-term DVT prevention.  This case highlights the importance of considering Deep Vein Thrombosis in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain  particularly if they have risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle  advancing age  and a family history of cardiovascular events.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,64,Patient Information: A 68-year-old African American male with a BMI of 28  non-smoker  lives in an urban area  and is a retired engineer.  Identification Data: The patient reported to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of increasing pain and swelling in his left lower leg for the past two days.  Chief Complaints: Pain in the left calf  which is 7/10 in intensity  worsening on walking  and associated with swelling in the same region. No reported fever  trauma  or recent surgeries.  History of Present Illness: The patient has been experiencing symptoms suggestive of left lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for the last two days. He first noticed mild calf pain that has gradually worsened and is now associated with swelling and warmth.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known case of hypertension for the past ten years  controlled on a calcium channel blocker. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia being managed with statins and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. No previous illness suggestive of any hematological disease or coagulopathies. No history of deep vein thrombosis  pulmonary embolism  or any other cardiovascular diseases.  Family History: His father had a stroke at the age of 72. His mother suffered from type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. No known family history of blood clotting disorders.  Social History: He lives alone with limited mobility due to chronic arthritic pain. His alcohol intake is minimal  does not smoke or use any recreational drugs. He consumes a diet high in saturated fats and low in fiber.  Current Medications: Amlodipine 5mg daily  Atorvastatin 40mg daily  and Metformin 500mg twice daily.  Physical Examination: Left lower limb is swollen  red  and warm compared to the right. Calf muscle tenderness noted. Bilateral ankle and knee joints show chronic degenerative changes.  Investigations: D-dimer test reported high levels. An ultrasound of the left lower extremity confirmed acute DVT in the left popliteal vein.  Diagnosis: The patient is diagnosed with Left Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis.  Discussion: The patient's symptoms along with his risk factors of age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  immobilization  and family history of atherosclerosis predispose him to DVT. Reduced physical activity due to arthritis could have led to sluggish venous blood flow  contributing to the development of DVT. It is crucial to treat it promptly to prevent complications such as a pulmonary embolism.   Plan: Immediate initiation of anticoagulation  patient education regarding the importance of mobility  dietary adjustments  and better management of chronic illnesses. Request the consultation of a Hematologist for further evaluation and treatment of Venous Thromboembolism and Nutritionist for dietary recommendations. The benefits and risks of the anticoagulant therapy will be discussed with the patient to ensure understanding and adherence.   Is there a mistake or incomplete information in the representation?
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,65,Patient Profile: Name: Jane Doe Age: 55 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Office Clerk Residential Area: Urban Smoker: Yes  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset pain and swelling in her left leg for the past 2 days.  Medical History: Mrs. Doe has a history of Type II diabetes for the past 20 years  is post-menopausal and is also moderately obese  with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 32. She reports no regular physical activity. No history of past surgeries.  Family History: Her father died from myocardial infarction at 68  and her mother is alive with chronic heart failure. A recent familial death found an uncle who died after pulmonary embolism.   Investigations: D-dimer test results show high levels. Duplex ultrasound confirms the presence of a clot in the deep veins of the left leg that is consistent with DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis). Chest x-ray and EKG were normal.  Diagnosis: On the basis of Mrs. Doe's medical history  presenting symptoms  and the results of her DVT specific tests  she is diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Discussion:  The patient's risk factors for DVT includes her sedentary lifestyle (she reports no regular physical activity)  her obesity  and her history of smoking. The history of cardiovascular problems in her family could also be a contributing factor.   The patient is actively smoking  which enhances the formation of blood clots that can restrict or block blood flow and induce Deep Vein Thrombosis. Similarly  obesity is a known risk factor well-established in the literature. It increases pressure in the veins of the pelvis and legs and raises the risk of DVT. Her sedentary lifestyle may also contribute to the development of DVT.  Lastly  hormonal changes in postmenopausal women and long-term use of hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of DVT  as seen in various studies.  Her DVT condition if untreated could also lead to a life-threatening condition known as thromboembolism (when the clot breaks away from the inner wall of the vein and travels to the lungs).  Management: Since Mrs. Doe is diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis  her management should include anticoagulant therapy  lifestyle modification including smoking cessation  and regular exercise. Weight loss should also be considered.   A follow-up should be scheduled after a month  and DVT symptoms should be closely monitored throughout the treatment.   Conclusion: DVT is a common but serious medical condition  and its successful management involves reducing risk factors and continued medical care. Mrs. Doe's case underscores the importance of regular physical activity  careful observation of symptoms  and thorough medical history investigation in the diagnosis and treatment of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,66,Patient Presentation  The patient we will be discussing today is a 68-year-old African American female  Mrs. Johnson  recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Mrs. Johnson is a retiree living in New York City  currently residing with her husband of 40 years.  She has a history of type II diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin  hypertension controlled with Lisinopril  and recurrent Varicose Veins that had not needed any surgical interventions yet. Mrs. Johnson had been taking an aspirin daily following her doctor's advice to prevent a heart event  considering her age and chronic conditions.  She has an unfortunate family history of cardiovascular diseases  with both parents having suffered myocardial infarctions in their late 60s  and her elder brother passing away at the age of 47 due to a stroke. Both her parents and her brother shared common risk factors of being overweight and having uncontrolled hypertension.  Mrs. Johnson presented to the ER with excruciating pain in the left lower limb  starting from the calf  reaching up to the thigh. The leg was swollen  bluish-red  and warm to touch. She had lost some mobility in the leg due to this and also noticed a slight shortness of breath since morning. On questioning  she revealed that she had recently traveled to Europe  a 9-hour flight  about a week ago for her grandson's graduation  and had been fairly immobile throughout.  Her prolonged immobility  existing medical conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  known varicose veins  combined with her family history and older age  immediately raised red flags for DVT. Ultrasound imaging confirmed the same  revealing a clot in the deep vein of her left leg.  Mrs. Johnson's case links the known risk factors of DVT  like older age  extended periods of immobility  history of varicose veins  and other cardiovascular diseases. Her race and gender do not significantly influence her DVT risk  but her familial history of cardiovascular diseases  obesity  and hypertension within the family cannot be overlooked. Increased awareness and active measures against prolonged immobility during travel  managing body weight  and stricter control over chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension  could prove to be critical in preventing DVT and related complications in such patients.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,67,Patient Profile: The patient in this case study  Mr. A.G.  is a 57-year-old Caucasian man from a middle-income background. He is a retired engineer and lives with his wife. He has three adult children and five grandchildren  and enjoys woodworking and fishing during his leisure time. The patient has a history of hypertension  which is being managed with medication: atenolol 50mg once daily.   Presenting Problem: Mr. A.G. presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of increasing discomfort  redness  and swelling in his right lower leg for the past two days. He also reported experiencing mild shortness of breath exacerbated by exertion.  Physical Exam & Test Results: A physical examination of his right lower extremity revealed warm skin  erythema  mild edema  and tenderness along the distribution of the calf muscles. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal vein.  Past Medical History: Mr. A.G.'s past medical history reveals that he has controlled hypertension for the past ten years. He also underwent knee replacement surgery on his right knee about 4 weeks ago. His medical history is otherwise unremarkable.  Family History: Regarding his family history  his father passed away at the age of 70 due to a stroke  and his mother died at the age of 75 due to complications from breast cancer. His sister has well-controlled type 2 diabetes.  Social History: Mr. A.G. has been a non-smoker for the past 30 years. He admits to social drinking but denies any substance abuse. He is normally quite active but his physical activity had declined after his knee replacement surgery. His diet is predominantly balanced with a high intake of fruits  vegetables  and lean proteins.  Discussion: Given Mr. A.G.'s recent knee surgery  immobility  and presenting symptoms  he is at high risk for developing DVT. His hypertension also represents a potential risk. Despite his history of controlled hypertension  his post-operative sedentary behavior combined his recent symptoms led to the development of DVT. Therefore  an individualized treatment plan which includes anticoagulation therapy and lifestyle modification is required to manage his DVT and decrease the chance of recurrence and complications. His case emphasizes the need for appropriate post-operative care and prophylaxis in preventing venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing major orthopedic procedures such as knee replacement.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,68,Patient Profile: Patient: Mr. Hamilton Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Accountant Residential Area: Urban Suburb Marital Status: Widower  Medical History: Patient diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes for the last 15 years. His medications include oral anti-diabetic agents and calcium channel blockers. Past records show he was also treated for a coronary artery disease about three years ago  with no recent complications.   Presenting Problem:   Mr. Hamilton presented with pain  redness  and swelling in his left lower leg. He described the pain as a sharp  constant ache. Symptoms started about four days ago  and have progressively worsened. Patient also reports mild shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  Family History:  Father had a history of myocardial infarction and mother suffered from a stroke; both had a history of hypertension. The patient has a brother who is currently on anticoagulation therapy due to recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Social History: The patient is a retired accountant and now lives alone after his wife passed away a couple of years back. He is a former smoker (quit twenty years ago)  drinks alcohol occasionally and has no history of drug use. His activity level is generally low; he spends much of his day seated reading or watching television. He has a diet rich in red meat and processed foods.  Examination & Diagnostic Evaluation: On examination  the left lower limb was visibly swollen  red and warm. His vital signs were stable albeit having slightly elevated blood pressure. An urgent Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of DVT in the left popliteal vein. A D-Dimer test was also conducted  revealing high levels  which further supported the diagnosis of DVT. Due to his reported chest discomfort and shortness of breath  a CT-pulmonary angiography was done to rule out pulmonary embolism  which confirmed that there was no PE.  Plan: The diagnosis of DVT and risk factors like advanced age  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of DVT certainly advocate for anticoagulation therapy. A hematologist's consult should be obtained regarding the initiation of anticoagulation therapy  possibly low molecular weight Heparin (e.g.  Enoxaparin) or a direct oral anticoagulant.  Continued monitoring of his diabetes and hypertension is necessary  and a healthier diet and increased physical activity need to be encouraged. Additionally  as Mr. Hamilton lives alone  he may need home health support  at least in the initial phase of his treatment. Regular follow-ups are also suggested with the multidisciplinary team to manage this patient most effectively.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,69,Patient Presentation:   Mr. X is a 55 year old Caucasian male who presented to A&E complaining of acute onset pain  swelling and warmth of the left lower extremity.   Past Medical History:  He has a medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation for which he was supposed to be taking oral anticoagulation therapy  but he had stopped medication three months prior due to reasons not well-known. He also has a history of high blood pressure  which is currently managed with ACE inhibitors. He has Type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with Metformin. Moreover  he has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32 and a smoker for the past 30 years with a pack year history of 20. No known drug allergies.   Demographics:  The patient lives alone and is an insurance advisor by profession  meaning he has a mainly sedentary lifestyle. He is a widower with two adult children who live out of state.  Family History:  Father passed away at the age of 62 due to myocardial infarction and his mother  aged 80  is alive with a history of hypertension. His older brother  aged 60  had a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.   Clinical History:  Two days prior to presentation  Mr. X noticed increasing warmth  swelling  and pain in his lower leg. He initially attributed this discomfort to a pulled muscle from when he was trying to move his furniture. Upon noticing redness and increased swelling  he sought medical attention. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  cough or symptoms related to any other system.   Examination:  On examination  his left calf is noticeably swollen  warm and erythematous. Positive Homan’s sign on the left  but negative on the right. His vital signs upon admission were: temperature: 37.2°C  pulse rate: 85 beats per minute  respiration: 16 per minute  blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg.    Investigations:  Lab results show an elevated D-dimer level. An immediate ultrasound was carried out which confirmed the presence of a clot in the left popliteal vein consistent with DVT.   Diagnosis and Treatment:  Mr. X was diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis most likely precipitated by cessation of anticoagulant therapy for his atrial fibrillation  his sedentary lifestyle due to his profession  obesity  diabetes  and a potential genetic predisposition (as suggested by the brother’s DVT). He was promptly started on IV heparin and will be transitioned onto warfarin  encouraged to lose weight and quit smoking. Patient education about the importance of adherence to medication was also carried out.   Prognosis and Follow Up: Mr. X will need close follow-up monitoring for signs of post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism. He will also need to take anticoagulant therapy for a minimum of 3 months and probably longer considering his risk factors. With lifestyle modification  the prognosis is fair and chances of recurrence can be minimized. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,70,Patient Profile: The patient under consideration is Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the hospital complaining of severe left calf pain  which has been worsening over the past week. His body mass index indicates he is overweight  with a value of 30 kg/m2. He is a lifetime non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He comes from a middle-class socioeconomic background.  Medical History: Mr. Smith is a known case of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is well-controlled with metformin. A year ago  he underwent total hip replacement surgery after a fall in his house. His postoperative period was uneventful and continued his daily low dose of aspirin.   Family History: He has a known family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had coronary artery disease and his elder sister was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post-pregnancy.   Present Illness: As per his statement  the pain is constant and somewhat relieved by elevating the leg. Mr. Smith's occupation as a truck driver forces him to be sedentary for extended periods during cross-country trips. Over the past week  he had been on a long trip  driving almost 6-7 hours at a stretch with little movement.   Physical Examination: Physical findings include left calf swelling which is warm to the touch and painful on deep palpation compared to the right calf. A positive Homan's sign was also demonstrated. No skin changes or ulcers were noted.   Investigations: Venous Doppler of lower extremities confirmed the presence of thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein  consistent with deep vein thrombosis. Coagulation profile showed increased D-dimer level.   Management: Intravenous Low Molecular Weight Heparin was initiated. He was admitted for further management and monitoring for complications such as pulmonary embolism. Patient's condition and symptoms started improving with the treatment.  Education and Follow-up: Information regarding his diagnosis was thoroughly explained to Mr. Smith  including the possible life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism. He was advised to follow up routinely  maintain better control of his diabetes  lose weight  and take frequent breaks during long drives for movement to prevent the recurrence of DVT.   The case presented above is a representative of a typical DVT patient  taking into account factors like age  gender  sedentary lifestyle  overweight  major surgery in the past year  and a family history of DVT which are known to increase the risk. In addition to these  his diabetic condition can cause changes in blood consistency and flow making him more susceptible to the condition.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,73,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile  Name: Anonymous Age: 67 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Presenting Complaint:  Patient presented with complaints of increased swelling  tenderness  warmth  and redness on his right lower leg. He reported feeling weak and experiencing mild  intermittent chest pain for several days.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was a smoker for 40 years before he quit 10 years ago. He also reported occasional alcohol consumption. He underwent hip replacement surgery two months prior.  Family History:  His mother died from heart disease. His father had a stroke at the age of 75. His older sibling died from a pulmonary embolism.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his right lower leg was swollen  red  and tender to touch. He was afebrile  with a pulse rate of 90 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg.   Investigations:  A Doppler ultrasound examination of the lower extremities displayed a blood clot in the right calf vein which confirmed the diagnosis of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A D-dimer test was also performed which was found to be elevated  signaling the presence of an intense coagulation process.   Treatment and Follow up:  Patient was started on anticoagulation therapy immediately with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and oral warfarin. Although initially resolved  the swelling and pain started to gradually reappear. An inferior vena cava filter was inserted to prevent pulmonary embolism.   Summary:  This is a case of a 67-year-old man diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis  with risk factors including a recent hip replacement surgery and personal habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Early diagnosis and the prompt start of anticoagulation therapy were crucial in the management of his condition. With such demographic representation  the incidence of DVT found in literature is about 1 per 1000 per year  however  the risk of DVT increases after the age of 60-65.   Social Determinants of Health:  Considering the social determinants of health  the patient being a retired individual may have led to a sedentary lifestyle  contributing to his medical conditions. His socio-economic status might have allowed him to take on habits like smoking and occasional drinking. It has been established in various studies that these are risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. Continuing efforts remain crucial to heighten the awareness of DVT  especially among those with multiple risk factors in order to prevent morbidities and mortalities associated with complications like pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,74,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Smith  a 55-year-old African-American male  comes to the clinic complaining of a prolonged dull pain  swelling  and redness in his right lower leg since last week. He reported sitting for prolonged periods due to the nature of his work (long-haul truck driver)  which indicates a sedentary lifestyle. He is hypertensive  a condition he has been managing with medication for the past ten years. Mr. Smith admits occasional smoking and alcohol consumption. He denies any allergies or current medications.  Family History:  His mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and his father had several heart ailments  suggesting that some of the genetic and lifestyle risk factors associated with DVT are present in his family history.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  there is pronounced swelling of the right leg compared to the left  with the skin over the gastrocnemius muscle having a warm  erythematous appearance. The patient rates the pain 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. Breathing and heart rates are within normal ranges. No chest pain or symptoms of short breath are reported.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's history and symptoms  a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is made. To confirm the condition  a Doppler ultrasound is ordered and showed a non-compressible venous segment in the right popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Treatment Strategy:  He is prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy (Rivaroxaban) to treat the existing clot and to prevent any pulmonary embolism. Lifestyle changes are suggested. This includes cessation of smoking and alcohol  an increase in physical activities  and positional changes during his long drives. He is also made aware of the importance of regular follow-up visits to monitor his condition.  Concluding Summary:  Mr. Smith’s case is a typical example of DVT  consistent with general demographics in literature. NYC epidemiologic studies show the prevalence of DVT often related to certain factors such as a sedentary job  long sitting  and a history of vascular diseases  as seen in Mr. Smith. His African-American race heightens the risk. African-Americans are presumed to have a 30-60% higher risk of developing DVT as compared to Caucasians. Health promotion and supportive care are essential components of his treatment plan. Regular monitoring is necessary to prevent complications like post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Mr. Smith is optimistic about the prescribed treatment strategy and has demonstrated commitment to adopting recommended lifestyle modifications.  Sources: 1. Zakai N  McClure LA.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,75,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Matthews is a 50-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling in his right lower leg for the past three days. He also reported a sensation of warmth over the affected area. Mr. Matthews works as a truck driver for a local delivery company and has been largely sedentary due to the nature of his occupation.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Matthews has a past medical history of hypertension  for which he takes amlodipine  and high cholesterol  which is managed with atorvastatin. He had an appendectomy 10 years ago and has no other known surgical history. He has no known allergies. He smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day and consumes alcohol socially. He does not have a regular exercise regimen  and his diet is high in sodium and fats.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiac diseases  including myocardial infarction and stroke in his first-degree relatives. His maternal grandfather had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after surgery  and his mother had recurrent DVT episodes. There is no known history of genetic clotting disorders in the family.  Investigations & Diagnosis:  Due to the clinical presentation and family history  a Doppler ultrasonography of his right lower leg was performed  which confirmed the presence of DVT. Over the course of the three days  his leg pain and swelling had increased and was more pronounced after long periods of sitting.  Treatment & Follow-up:  Mr. Matthews was subsequently admitted for anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring of his DVT. He was started on a regimen of low molecular weight heparin and warfarin. A plan was made to follow his progress with serial Doppler ultrasounds and regular monitoring of his INR levels. He was discharged with instructions to continue warfarin and to follow up with a vascular surgeon and hematologist to investigate if there is an underlying clotting disorder.   The patient was also educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications  such as regular exercise  a low salt  low-fat diet  quitting smoking  and reducing alcohol consumption to manage hypertension and high cholesterol. He was also advised to take regular breaks during his long drives to avoid sitting for prolonged periods.   In summarizing Mr. Matthew's case  several risk factors for DVT are evident: prolonged periods of immobility due to his occupation  smoking history  unhealthy diet  and significant family history. It further underscores the importance of considering DVT in patients with similar risk profiles presenting with an acute onset of unilateral leg pain and swelling. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,76,Patient Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 54-year-old African-American male  5’9” and 190lbs  from Dallas  Texas presents with symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). A nonsmoker and social drinker  Mr. Smith works as an IT professional with long hours in a sedentary position.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Smith presented with a 3-day history of discomfort  warmth  and swelling in the lower left calf  which he initially attributed to a strenuous workout. However  symptoms did not improve with rest and over-the-counter NSAIDs. The patient reported no chest pain  shortness of breath  or other symptoms.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily respectively). He had no past incidents of blood clots or coagulation disorders. His last pertinent lab workup was performed six months ago  with all results within normal limits except for slightly elevated LDL cholesterol.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at 62 and died of subsequent complications. His mother is alive at 80 with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. He has one older brother who is alive and well  with no known health issues.  Physical Examination and Diagnostics: The physical examination revealed tenderness and erythema over the left calf region with a noticeable increase in calf circumference compared to the right leg. The patient's vital signs were stable. Venous Doppler ultrasound found a deep vein thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein. A D-dimer test was positive. Pulmonary Embolism was ruled out with a negative computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) scan.   Assessment and Plan: A diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was confirmed. Immediately after diagnosis  Mr. Smith was started on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) and oral Warfarin. He was educated regarding the side effects of these medications  importance of follow-up appointments for monitoring INR  as well as the importance of early leg movements and exercise. A follow up in two weeks was scheduled for reevaluation and adjustment of his anticoagulation regimen. Lifestyle modifications and a possible reassessment of his work situation was discussed to reduce long periods of immobility.   As Mr. Smith’s case indicates  DVT can be present even in patients without significant risk factors or family history. Ensuring early detection and management is key to preventing severe complications such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS).

Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,79,Patient Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:  Our patient  Mr. Wilson  is a 65-year-old man recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Mr. Wilson is of African American ethnicity  retired  married and lives in St. Louis  Missouri.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Wilson complained of persistent and worsening discomfort and swelling in his right calf for 1 week. He also reported slight shortness of breath  especially when walking up stairs or exerting himself.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Wilson has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are currently managed with medication. His record also indicates that he was a smoker for 30 years but quit 10 years ago.   Family History:  There is a notable family history of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 70  and his older sister is living with diagnosed peripheral artery disease. There is no reported history of DVT or pulmonary embolism in the family.  Social History:  Mr. Wilson has been retired for five years after a long career as a truck driver. His retirement mainly involves sedentary activities; he enjoys watching TV  reading  and playing cards with friends. He does not engage in regular physical exercise and admits to an 'average' diet.  Clinical Examination:  On physical exam  Mr. Wilson exhibited right calf swelling  with pitting edema and mild tenderness. His vital signs were within normal limits.   Investigations:  A Duplex Ultrasound identified a clot in the deep veins of his right lower leg  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Lab reports also showed increased D-Dimer levels. His blood glucose and blood pressure readings were slightly elevated at the time of consultation.  Management:  Mr. Wilson was started on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin  coupled with at-home treatment using oral warfarin. Regular INR monitoring was scheduled to ensure appropriate warfarin dosing. He was also recommended a change in diet and an increased physical activity level.  Prognosis:  Mr. Wilson's prognosis is generally good with the appropriate anticoagulant treatment and lifestyle modifications. However  due to his previous history of hypertension and diabetes  there are potential complications including the possibility of a pulmonary embolism that should be continuously monitored. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary for INR monitoring  medication adjustments  and to ensure his symptoms are improving.  This case provides an opportunity to recognize the importance of early DVT detection and the need for continuous patient risk factor assessment  particularly in patients with known chronic conditions. Further  it demonstrates the need for comprehensive patient education and lifestyle changes in DVT management.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,80,Patient Profile: The patient is a 62 year old Caucasian female  named Ms. Smith  who resides in suburban New York.   Presenting Problem: Ms. Smith presented with increasing pain  redness  swelling  and warmth in her left lower leg  which she noticed had been getting progressively worse over the past few days. On physical examination  her left calf was significantly larger than her right one.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a past history of type 2 diabetes managed with metformin and hypertension managed by a low sodium diet and daily lisinopril. She had undergone a total knee replacement surgery two months ago. She also has occasional migraine headaches for which she takes over-the-counter ibuprofen. She is allergic to sulfa drugs  which cause rash.   Family History: There is a significant family history of venous thromboembolic events; her mother had an unprovoked deep vein thrombosis at the age of 65  and her brother experienced a pulmonary embolism at the age 55. Her father  at age 68  experienced a stroke.   Psycho-Social History: Ms. Smith is a retired teacher who lives alone. She stopped smoking a decade ago and drinks alcohol on social occasions only. According to her  she has been spending most of her time in bed or sitting on her couch since her knee surgery.   Current Medications: Her daily medications include metformin  lisinopril  and a multivitamin tablet. She occasionally takes an ibuprofen tablet for her migraine.  Assessment: Based on the symptoms  family history and her recent knee surgery  a venous doppler was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a DVT in the left popliteal vein.

Other routine blood tests were within normal limits  including renal function tests and coagulation profile.  This patient falls into a high-risk category for DVT due to his history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  long sedentary travel  advanced age  and African-American ethnicity. Research shows that African-American ethnicity has been linked to a heightened risk for DVT  this increased risk seems to be related to a higher prevalence of obesity  hypertension  and diabetes.  The case is complicated given the combination of his conditions and the fact that he had delayed seeking medical attention. The patient was initially treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an outpatient  and his therapy was transitioned to warfarin later. He was educated about the importance of physical activity  maintaining a balanced diet  regular medication  and regular follow-ups.   The literature recommends that those with a history of DVT should be followed up consistently  given that the risk of recurrence remains substantial even after successful resolution of the initial event.   A referral for the patient to see a dietician was done to help him with his diet and obesity  which are important risk factors for DVT. Changes in lifestyle and diet will be critical to manage his overall health condition.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,95,Patient: Mrs. Sarah Smith Age: 67 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Residence: Urban setting (Midwestern United States) Insurance Status: Medicare   Chief Complaint:  Mrs. Smith presented with unilateral left leg pain and swelling that has progressively worsened over the past week.  Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago) currently on Lisinopril. 2) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: diagnosed 7 years ago currently on Metformin and diet controlled.  Surgical History:  Right hip replacement surgery 5 years ago.  Family History:  Mother with history of stroke at age 72  father deceased from heart disease at age 70. One older sibling has a history of venous thromboembolism.  Social History:  Mrs. Smith is a non-smoker but reports moderate alcohol use. She lives with her husband and is independent in her activities of daily living.  Presentation: On physical examination  her left leg was noticeably swollen with a circumference significantly greater than the right. It was erythematous  warm to touch  and tender along the line of her deep veins. No signs of superficial thrombophlebitis. Vital signs were: Blood pressure: 135/85 mmHg  Heart rate: 83 bpm  Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per min  Oxygen Sat: 98% on room air  Temperature: 98.7 F.  Investigations: A duplex ultrasound of the left lower limb showed a non-compressible segment in her left femoral vein  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Discussion: Mrs. Smith had several risk factors for DVT including her age  recent immobility  history of surgery  and a significant family history. Her hypertension and diabetes may also indirectly increase her risk of cardiovascular diseases such as DVT.   Management: She was admitted for anticoagulation management  starting on a course of heparin with a plan to bridge to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. Her response to the treatment was closely monitored. Some discussion was started about considering the placement of an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter given her history of surgery which could potentially limit her mobility during the recovery period thus predisposing her to clot formation.  Given her confirmed diagnosis of DVT  she will also require thorough patient education about the signs of pulmonary embolism due to the potential risk of DVT resulting in a life-threatening PE.   Follow-up: Appropriate follow-up arrangements were made at an anticoagulation clinic to continue the management of her DVT and monitor for any signs of post-thrombotic syndrome.  Mrs. Smith's case highlights the importance of considering deep vein thrombosis in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially those with multiple risk factors. Prompt diagnosis and management can prevent serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,96,Subject: 62-Year-Old Male Diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Demographics: Our patient  Mr. Tim Reynolds  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male currently residing in New York City. He lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle with a part-time job in office management. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but continues to consume alcohol moderately. He lives with his only son while his wife passed away a few years ago.  Medical History: Mr. Reynolds has a past medical history significant for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed with both conditions 8 years ago and has managed his condition with medication (Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes) and lifestyle changes. Mr. Reynolds also has a history of intermittent claudication; however  vascular evaluation performed five years ago did not reveal any significant occlusive disease. He also has a history of chronic low back pain and takes over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Reynolds has come in with complaints of a painful  red  swollen left calf that has been getting worse over the last two days. He denies recent trauma  surgeries  prolonged immobilization  or previous similar episodes. He also denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or other worrisome symptoms.  Examination: On examination  his vitals were normal  but there was evident calf swelling  warmth  and tenderness on the left side. He exhibits positive Homan's sign (pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the foot).  Investigations: D-Dimer assay came back positive  following which he underwent Doppler ultrasonography confirming the presence of a non-compressible left popliteal vein  indicative of deep vein thrombosis.  Family History:  Father died at the age of 72 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother lived until 88 with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has one brother  aged 60 years  who suffers from asthma. There is no known family history of bleeding disorders or venous thromboembolism.  Summary: In summary  Mr. Reynolds is a 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and intermittent claudication who has presented with typical signs and symptoms of DVT  which was confirmed through imaging studies. Given his history of known risk factors (e.g.  age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  prior episodes of claudication)  it's crucial to promptly initiate appropriate anticoagulation therapy while also addressing his risk factors to prevent the progression or recurrence of the disease. Additionally  patient education on symptom recognition and when to seek medical attention is paramount.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,9,97,Patient Profile  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 61 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Urban  Ohio  USA  Case Presentation  Mr. John Doe  a 61-year-old Caucasian man  was admitted for investigation of pain and swelling in his right leg for the past week. On examination  his right leg was swollen and tender  particularly in the calf area. These symptoms lead to suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Previous Medical History  Mr. Doe has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension for the past 15 years. He smokes approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years and does not practice regular physical exercise. He takes Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for Hypertension  and Atorvastatin for elevated cholesterol levels.  Family Medical History  His family history is significant with a father who had coronary artery disease and a mother who had a stroke  both in their 60s. His younger brother was diagnosed with DVT a few years ago.   Social History  Mr. Doe had been a truck driver for almost 30 years before retiring. He currently lives with his wife and enjoys a mostly sedentary lifestyle since retirement. He consumes alcohol occasionally and does not have any known drug habits.  Current Clinical Assessment  An ultrasound was performed after initial physical assessment  which confirmed the presence of DVT in the right lower leg  showing a partially occlusive thrombus. CBC  creatinine  electrolyte  and liver function tests showed results within normal limits. His blood glucose level was slightly elevated (145 mg/dl)  and his blood pressure was moderately high (145/90 mmHg). His BMI is 29.5 kg/m^2  which indicates that he is overweight.  Given Mr. Doe's history of chronic conditions  his lifestyle considerations (including his smoking and sedentary behaviors)  and his family history  it is reasonable to conclude that these factors contributed to his heightened risk for DVT. Elevation of his leg and comepression stockings were initiated  and he was started on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin for DVT treatment  with dose adjustments planned according to his INR level.   Dietary control for his diabetes  and modification of lifestyle including smoking cessation  weight reduction  and regular exercise is urgently advised. He is also recommended for a regular follow-up with his endocrinologist  cardiologist  and primary care doctor.   Thus  Mr. Doe's case illustrates the importance of lifestyle modifications for preventing vascular diseases like DVT  particularly for individuals with known chronic conditions. Further  his case highlights the significance of appropriate action and timely medical intervention in case of DVT.

He is a moderate smoker since his early 30s  physically not very active and consumes alcohol socially. Recently diagnosed as pre-diabetic.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has been hypertensive for the past 10 years  controlled on medication (Lisinopril 10mg BID). Six months ago  he was diagnosed with pre-diabetes but remains non-compliant with lifestyle modification advice. He had a minor MI at age 55 with a cardiac stent placement. He also has mild osteoarthritis in his left hip since the last few years.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith came into the ER complaining of a sudden onset of pain and swelling in his left leg  that started a couple of days ago. He denies any trauma  fever  chest pain  dyspnea or recent surgeries. He admits that he had been sitting for prolonged periods during a recent road trip. He has noticed increased warmth  redness over the calf and the pain appears to increase while walking. He reports no issues in his right leg.  Remarks: This case is designed to highlight key demographics at risk for deep vein thrombosis such as African-American ethnicity  male gender  obesity  age  and recent sedentary behavior. The patient's other risk factors include hypertension  smoking  pre-diabetes  and past history of myocardial infarction increasing his propensity for thromboembolitic events. His lifestyle  including his occupation and lack of physical activity also contribute to the risk for DVT.  It is also important to notice his lack of adherence to prescribed treatment and healthy lifestyle changes  as this is an issue medical professionals often encounter in real-world practice. So  considerations regarding patient education  behavior modification measures and regular follow-ups are key to better prognosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,3,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  This case revolves around a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Johnson.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been suffering from hypertension and Type II diabetes for the past decade. He is a retired bank manager and used to smoke heavily during his youth  but has been abstinent for about 20 years. He is also obese with a BMI of 34. There's a positive family history of venous thromboembolism in his elder brother and mother. His medications include metformin  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and aspirin.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Johnson has recently returned from an international business trip  during which he had a long  non-stop flight. Over the past week  he has been complaining about progressive pain  swelling  and warmth in his left leg. He also mentioned sitting for prolonged periods during his journey and at the meeting. Today  he has come in with complaints of increased pain in his left leg and shortness of breath.  Please note that this overview of Mr. Johnson's case has been simplified for easy understanding and does not detail all aspects of his health profile.  *It should be recognized that while DVT can occur in anyone  certain conditions and lifestyle factors increase the risk. They include long periods of bed rest  smoking  being overweight or obese  pregnancy  birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy  a genetic predisposition  and age  among others. Mr. Johnson's profile includes several of these risk factors  which should be considered when devising his treatment plan.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,4,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Adam Thompson  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  retired professor residing in Seattle  Washington.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of obesity (BMI 31)  type 2 diabetes managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypertension under control with medications. He has been a non-smoker for the last ten years  but there is a history of 30 pack-years smoking prior to cessation. He underwent a total right knee replacement surgery six weeks ago. His postoperative period was complicated due to decreased mobility and limited access to physical therapy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Key Complaints: In the last two days  Mr. Thompson has been experiencing progressive pain and swelling in his right lower leg which he initially accounted to overexertion during a session of physical therapy. However  the increase in the intensity of pain and worsening swelling  accompanied by a low-grade fever  prompted him to seek medical attention immediately. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath or coughing.  The case represents key risk factors for deep vein thrombosis including advanced age  obesity  history of recent surgery  limited mobility  and previous smoking history. Mr. Thomson's complaints of a progressively painful  swollen lower limb post-surgery are indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) pending further examination and diagnostic tests. The absence of respiratory symptoms minimizes the chance of a pulmonary embolism  however  it should not be discounted and further evaluation should be recommended.   This case allows medical students to evaluate multiple risk factors leading to a typical case of DVT. It also shows the importance of time-sensitive management and the readiness to anticipate potential complications  particularly among higher-risk patients. Furthermore  the case points out how factors beyond the patient's direct medical history  such as limited access to physical therapy (a social determinant of health)  can impact the patient's health outcomes.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,5,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Demographic Information:  Patient: Mrs. Elizabeth Martinez Age: 63  Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired teacher  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Martinez visited the outpatient department complaining of marked pain  swelling  and warmth in her left leg  which has progressively worsened over the last week. She also mentioned a mild heaviness in the chest and recent shortness of breath  particularly when climbing stairs.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled with medication.  - Type II diabetes  diagnosed 8 years ago  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. - She underwent total knee replacement surgery on her right knee six weeks back.  Family History: Her mother passed away due to a stroke (ischemic) at the age of 70 and her father had a history of varicose veins.  Lifestyle Information:  Mrs. Martinez is a non-smoker and she does not consume alcohol. She lives with her daughter and is fairly inactive due to her recent surgery. She mentions gaining some weight in the past year.  Observations: On physical examination  the left calf appears significantly swollen and red compared to the right. There is tenderness upon palpation. Her blood pressure reads at 140/90 and her body mass index (BMI) is calculated as 30  which falls into the category of obesity.  These symptoms prompt suspicion of deep vein thrombosis  which is occasionally seen post-surgery and exacerbated by her sedentary lifestyle and possible genetic predisposition. The shortness of breath and chest discomfort also indicate a possible pulmonary embolism which requires immediate investigation.  Note: The purpose of discussion around this case would be to teach medical students about the pathogenesis  risk factors  clinical features  diagnosis  complications  and management of deep vein thrombosis. Based on representation  it is worth noting that DVT does not discriminate by ethnicity  and individuals with diverse backgrounds can be affected. It's important to consider social determinants of health in the prevention and management of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,6,Case Title: Assessment and Management of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics:  Patient Initials: T.M. Age: 60 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Software Engineer (sedentary job) Residence: Urban area  Past Medical History:  T.M. has a past history of hypertension  being controlled with lisinopril 10mg once daily. The patient had undergone a total right hip replacement due to osteoarthritis two years ago. He has no known allergies. T.M. has a 25 pack-years smoking history and occasionally consumes alcohol. His father had a history of myocardial infarction and his mother had a stroke.  Chief Complaint:  Patient presented to the outpatient clinic with complaints of gradual onset of pain in the left lower leg  which he describes as a constant  'heavy'  aching pain. Additionally  he reported mild swelling. The pain worsens with walk and eases when he raises the leg. Denies any chest pain  hemoptysis  recent travel or immobility  and trauma. No previous episodes of similar complaints.  Discussion:  This case is representative of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) for several reasons. The patient's age falls into the approximate range where incidence of DVT begins to increase significantly  with majority patterns reported in individuals aged between 50 and 60. Additionally  the patient is male and Caucasian  which reflect demographic trends reported in DVT cases.   His overall sedentary lifestyle as a software engineer  combined with his past surgical history  hypertension  smoking  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases further classifies him as predisposed to a prothrombotic state. The patient’s symptoms of left leg pain and swelling correlate with typical DVT symptoms  with the lack of chest pain and hemoptysis making pulmonary embolism less likely – though it should still be a consideration with any DVT.   This case could help medical students understand the risk factors  symptoms  and approach towards diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis. It's crucial to emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment of DVT to prevent serious complications  such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,7,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Williams. He is retired and lives with his wife in a suburban community. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history  quit smoking ten years ago. Drinks socially  on occasion.   Past Medical History: Mr. Williams has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily) and occasional hypercholesteremia controlled with diet and exercise. He has no known drug allergies. In addition  the patient had an uneventful right total knee arthroplasty performed eight weeks ago. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; father died due to myocardial infarction at age 73  and a brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his mid-60s.  Key Complaints: Mr. Williams presents with a four-day history of increasing pain  swelling  and redness in his right leg  the same leg where he had his recent knee surgery. He denies any history of trauma to the leg or any strenuous physical activities. He mentions that he has been mostly sedentary since his surgery  spending a lot of time sitting or lying down. He further reports experiencing mild shortness of breath for the past day but no chest pain. He hasn't experienced any recent fevers  chills  or other symptoms.   This case aims to highlight the risk factors for DVT  such as surgery  immobility  age  and tobacco use. Additionally  the signs and symptoms of DVT and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism are embodied in Mr. William's presentation. This scenario will offer learners the opportunity to discuss differential diagnoses  necessary diagnostic tests  and optimal management strategies for DVT  acknowledging the balance between anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding.   [Note: The objective of this case is solely for educational purposes and to reflect a common presentation of DVT. Patient details are fictional and any resemblance to real patients is purely coincidental.]
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,8,Patient Profile:  Name: John Pierce   Age: 68 years   Ethnicity: Caucasian (White)   Gender: Male   Occupation: Retired corporate executive   Location: Lives alone in a suburban setting    Past Medical History:   - Type 2 Diabetes  - Hypertension - Had total knee replacement surgery one month ago. - Known smoker for the last 40 years  currently trying to quit. - No known drug allergies  vivid family history  and negative for HIV status.  Presenting complaints:   John came to the emergency department with the chief complaints of: - Sudden onset of swelling in his left calf which started two days ago  with increased size. - Persistent pain described as throbbing in nature  more pronounced in the left leg. - Increased skin warmth and redness over the left lower leg. - Shortness of breath  particularly when climbing stairs or on exertion. - Intermittent chest pain for past 24 hours  characterized as a dull ache localized at the center of the chest.  The main objective of this case report is to educate medical students about deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's age  particularly post-surgery immobility  history of smoking  and other comorbidities like Diabetes and Hypertension make him relatively high-risk. The nature of symptoms also strongly suggests DVT. The case will unravel how to diagnose  manage such patients  and prevent complications. The students can also understand the need for prophylaxis in high-risk cases. This case should be adequately representative as the literature often cites older  immobilized  and post-surgical patients with comorbidities as high risk for DVT.

Since retirement two years ago  he has been sedentary and obese with a BMI of 30. There were no previous instances of DVT. He also reports a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years. He quit smoking after his MI four years ago.  Chief Complaints: Patient presented with a 3-day history of left unilateral leg swelling  redness  and tenderness. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  cough or light headedness. He also reported no overnight travels or prolonged bed rest. There's no history of injury to the swollen leg. Pain and swelling were not relieved by over-the-counter pain medication.   This case has been specifically designed to allow students to train on deep vein thrombosis. DVT is relatively common and is a critical medical condition. It's important to remember that some demographical groups (like elderly  obese individuals with a sedentary lifestyle and other risk factors like smoking and co-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension) are more at risk than others. The case also provides an opportunity to address the adverse effects of uncontrolled diabetes and importance of lifestyle measures like quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy weight.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,12,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  A 62-year-old African American male  employed as a long-distance truck driver  living in an urban setting.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of obesity with a BMI of 32  controlled hypertension  and smoking (1 pack/day for past 35 years). He does not lead an active lifestyle and has no history of surgeries. He has no known drug allergies. The family history reveals a father who died of a myocardial infarction and a mother with a personal history of deep vein thrombosis.  Chief Complaints: The patient presents at the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of increasing pain and swelling in the left lower leg. He also reports a slight shortness of breath over the same period.  Present Illness: The patient reports mild  dull discomfort that began in the left calf 3 days ago  which has progressively worsened. He notes that the leg has become more swollen and appears more reddened than the other. He has noticed an increased shortness of breath particularly when climbing stairs  which was never an issue before.  Other symptoms include a mild chest discomfort and he noticed a low-grade fever last night. He denies any recent injuries  unexplained bleeding  or bruising. He also denies any fainting  severe headaches or abdominal pain.   Given these factors - including his sedentary profession  obesity  smoking habits  and personal family history of cardiovascular disease and DVT - the patient is at high risk for developing DVT  making it a key area of focus in his medical assessment and subsequent treatment.   Conclusion: This case report offers an opportunity for medical students to understand the risk factors  recognize the symptoms  and develop a comprehensive treatment plan for Deep Vein Thrombosis. The diverse background and lifestyle of the patient may also aid in understanding and addressing health disparities in veinous thromboembolism occurrences.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,13,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics- Name: Mr. Parker Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired computer engineer Location: Urban  Midwest USA  Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension - diagnosed 8 years ago  currently on medication (Lisinopril) 2) Type II Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 6 years ago  managed with Metformin 3) Obesity - BMI 32.1 4) Past smoker - quit 4 years ago  smoked 1 pack/day for 35 years  5) Recent knee replacement surgery - underwent surgery 3 weeks ago still in recovery period.  Key complaints: Mr. Parker presents to the emergency department with a complaint of increased swelling and pain in his right leg  which has been progressively worsening over the past 2-3 days. He also mentions a light feeling of breathlessness and an occassional chest tightness. No associated fever  nausea or lightheadedness.  This case presents a typical picture seen in DVT cases of an elderly white male with past medical history of hypertension  diabetes and recent surgery (considered high-risk factors). He is obese and was a smoker  which are additional risk factors for the development of a thrombus. The unexplained leg swelling and pain warrant a high index of suspicion for DVT. His chest symptoms may indicate an advanced stage i.e. pulmonary embolism  which is a serious complication of DVT. It is important that the medical students learn to recognize the key symptoms and correlating risk factors to diagnose and treat DVT appropriately.   Further evaluation using diagnostic tools like D-dimer test and Duplex Ultrasound can confirm the suspected DVT and for pulmonary embolism  a CT pulmonary angiogram or a V/Q scan would be definitive. Understand that quick diagnosis and treatment initiation is vital in preventing potential lethal complications like Pulmonary Embolism.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,14,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. D James  an African-American male aged 63 years old  lives in a suburban neighborhood in Atlanta  Georgia. He is a retired bus driver  leading a primarily sedentary lifestyle. He is married with two adult children and maintains a smoking habit of 20 cigarettes a day for the past 40 years. Overweight  with a BMI of 31 kg/m2.  Past Medical History:  Mr. James has a significant medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia which are reasonably controlled through medication. He had an incident of left lower extremity DVT 6 years ago. After hospitalization  he was treated with anticoagulation therapy for several months. There's no familial history of clotting disorders. He also had an appendectomy at the age of 22  no other previous surgeries noted.  Key Complaints:  The patient complains of acute onset pain and tenderness at the site of last DVT  his left lower leg  since waking up this morning. The pain has become progressively worse and is associated with swelling and redness. Despite attempts at alleviating the discomfort with over-the-counter analgesics and rest  the pain persisted. There is no fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath. He denies any recent trauma to the leg  prolonged periods of immobilization  or recent travels.  Note:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs in approximately 1 of 1 000 patients annually  commonly in elderly patients and slightly more frequently in males. The black population appears to be at a relatively higher risk of first-time VTE. Obesity  smoking  and a sedentary lifestyle are significant risk factors for DVT. Comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia further increase the risk. A previous episode of DVT drastically elevates the chance of a recurrent DVT.   This training case represents a typical population profile  thus providing a realistic clinical scenario  emphasizing high-risk factors  accurate demographic representation  and common symptoms typical to DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,15,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Robert Turner Gender: Male Age: 62 Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Truck Driver  Medical History: Mr. Turner has been previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes a decade ago. He is a former heavy smoker having quit 7 years back but admits to episodes of binge drinking. He reports being overweight and leading a sedentary lifestyle. He has not had any surgeries in the past. There is a family history of clotting disorders  with his elder sister diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) a few years back.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Turner presented to the emergency room with chief complaints of unilateral leg swelling and pain localized in the left calf for the past two days. He also reported shortness of breath that had recently worsened. The patient denied any recent travel  trauma  suppressive therapy  immobility  or oral contraceptive use.  On examination  the left calf was significantly swollen  warm to touch  and reddened with a distinct tenderness on palpation compared to the right. There was a marked difference in the circumference of the affected and unaffected leg. On review of systems  the patient presented with mild chest discomfort and shortness of breath  indicative of possible pulmonary embolism  a serious complication of DVT.   Reason for Case Study: This case highlights a typical profile of a patient at risk for DVT. Certain demographics  such as being a middle-aged Caucasian male  increase the risk. Lifestyle factors  such as obesity  sedentary living  smoking and alcohol consumption  also contribute to the risk profile. A familiar history of DVT is also important. Finally  the mild symptoms of pulmonary embolism should be noted for their high morbidity and mortality rate. This case can help students identify risk factors  suggest suitable diagnostic procedure  provide appropriate treatment  and offer prevention advice for patients susceptible to DVT.   Sources: 1.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,16,"Case Report   Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in an Elderly Caucasian Male  Patient Demographics:  Initials: M.J  Age: 68 Years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Banker Residence: Urban area  lives alone  Medical History:  M.J has had a usually good bill of health until five years ago when he was diagnosed with Type-II Diabetes Mellitus. He has been on metformin to control his blood glucose levels. He also has a history of hypertension managed with Lisinopril and Amlodipine. For the last 7 years  he has been on statins for his moderately high cholesterol levels. He does not have any known allergies to medications. M.J is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally. He leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity. Family history includes a mother with a history of stroke and a father who died of heart attack.  Key Complaints:  M.J reports acute onset of pain and swelling in his right lower extremity  more specifically in the calf muscle  which he noticed this morning. He described the pain as a """"pulling sensation"""". The pain has progressively gotten worse through the day. He reports no recent injuries  travels  or prolonged periods of immobility. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  or any other systemic symptoms. He also denies any history of similar episodes in the past. Upon further questioning  he recalls that he has been experiencing more fatigue than usual and some unintended weight loss over the past few weeks.  As per current literature  males aged 65 and above have a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Lifestyle factors  such as sedentary behavior  along with the presence of comorbidities like hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  which MJ possesses  also increase the DVT risk. Early identification and management of DVT in older patients are crucial to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism  which can be potentially life-threatening."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,17,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics Name: Mr. Albert Brown Age: 65 years  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired school teacher Phys Address: 34 Pheasant Street  Hingham  Massachusetts  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown underwent a total knee replacement surgery on his right knee 4 weeks ago due to severe arthrosis. Notably  he has a history of hypertension and is currently on daily medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). He also takes low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. He is an ex-smoker and quit 10 years ago. However  he drank alcohol socially but in moderation. From his lifestyle details  he leads a sedentary life and lacks physical exercise on a regular basis. There are no known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Brown visited the ER complaining of acute onset  unilateral swelling  and pain in his right lower calf region progressively worsening over the past 2 days. Redness and warmth over the affected area are also reported. Upon inquiry  he mentioned breathing problems intensifying with deep breaths and discomfort in his chest for the past several hours. He denied experiencing fever  recent trauma to his leg  or any family history of blood clots. He hasn’t reported any significant weight loss or unhealthy changes in his dietary routine. For the past few weeks post his knee surgery  he has been mostly confined to bed rest with limited mobility.  Additional Information: The fact that Mr. Brown is an elderly  post-arthroscopic  sedentary individual puts him at a high risk for deep vein thrombosis. The symptoms like shortness of breath and chest discomfort may indicate the possibility of a serious complication like pulmonary embolism. Therefore  he must be urgently evaluated and  if indeed a DVT is found  promptly treated.  Reference/Evidence: According to many studies  surgical patients have a 60% risk of developing a DVT as compared to the general population due to factors like immobility  vascular trauma  and hypercoagulable state. Also  important to note is the high risk associated with the elderly population and those with a sedentary lifestyle. [Source: Geerts WH  Pineo GF  Heit JA  et al.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,18,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Patient Initials: M.B. Age: 69 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired accountant  living with her husband  Past Medical History: - Underwent knee replacement surgery 2 months ago - Diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago  under medication - No history of cardiovascular diseases - Occasional smoker  - No known allergies to medications  Key Complaints: Mrs. M.B. presented to the emergency department complaining of a swollen  red  warm leg. Her left calf specifically had worsened over three days  causing a lot of pain and discomfort while walking. She also reported a handful of instances of dyspnea over the last few days. She denied any chest pain  cough  or bleeding problems. There were no reports of recent trauma  prolonged travel  or family history of coagulation disorders.  ---  Note: This case scenario was developed based on the fact that deep vein thrombosis commonly affects the older population  particularly those who have undergone recent surgery or immobilization. As there's a higher prevalence among women than men  a female patient was chosen. The scenario also takes into consideration common risk factors like age and hypertension and provides a good basis for discussion about the diagnosis  management  and complications of venous thrombosis. This notably includes the potential for pulmonary embolism  indicated by the patient's dyspnea. Finally  the fact that she is Caucasian is representative of the higher prevalence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in individuals of European descent.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,19,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics ---------------------- Name: Mrs. Elaine Thompson Age: 45 years  Sex: Female  Ethnic Background: Caucasian (As per literature  the incidence rate of DVT is high among Caucasian women) Occupation: Corporate lawyer (mostly sedentary work)  Past Medical History ---------------------- 1. Overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32. Obesity is a known risk factor for DVT. 2. Non-Smoker. 3. No known family history of DVT  but maternal grandmother had a history of stroke (potential non-genetic thrombotic risk factor). 4. No known history of malignancy. 5. No known allergies. 6. Regular Medications: Oral contraceptive pill for the previous 15 years.  7. Recently had an orthopedic injury (a broken ankle) 2 weeks ago  for which she underwent open reduction and internal fixation under general anesthesia. postoperative period unremarkable  she has been immobile since the surgery.  Key Complaints ---------------- Presenting to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of right leg pain  redness  warmth  swelling all over the calf region  and low-grade fever. She also complained of a pulling sensation in the leg with a mild  dull ache that intensifies with standing or walking. Denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitation.   Notes for the Medical Educator - -------------------------------- This case scenario provides an excellent tutorial for your medical students to learn about DVT as it encompasses various risk factors  including obesity  exogenous estrogen use (oral contraceptive pill)  recent surgery (orthopedic)  and immobilization. Furthermore  it provides an opportunity to teach about DVT's potential complications (like pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome)  its diagnosis (history  physical examination  and investigations like D-dimer test  Doppler Ultrasound of affected region)  and its management (anticoagulation therapy  use of compression stockings  thrombolytic therapy etc). The students can also be taught about DVT prophylaxis in high-risk individuals. This case rightly represents common demographic traits as seen in clinical practice and would be beneficial for their future patient encounters.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,20,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information  Gender: Male Age: 62 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Taxi Driver (indicates prolonged periods of sitting)  Background and local demographic facts: According to scientific literature  the incidence of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is higher among the Caucasian population  older adults (above 40)  and those with sedentary occupations or lifestyles.   Past Medical History  - Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents - Hypertension for 10 years  controlled with antihypertensive medications - Ex-smoker  quit 5 years ago - Had a minor stroke 2 years back with full recovery - Father and elder brother had history of DVT - Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30  indicating obesity  Key Complaints  - Severe aching pain in right lower leg that started 2 days ago - Swelling and redness in right calf region - Mild fever and malaise for last 2 days - Feeling of warmth over the skin of the affected area - Unexplained shortness of breath started a few hours ago - No chest pain or palpitations  On examination  the right calf is found to be swollen  red and warmer than the left. The patient’s vitals are stable apart from a slightly elevated heart rate.   Teaching Notes: This typical case is designed to prompt students to: 1. Identify the risk factors for DVT (age  ethnicity  sedentary occupation  long-term chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  family history of DVT  obesity and previous thrombotic event — minor stroke). 2. Recognize the common symptoms of DVT and relate the symptom of shortness of breath to a possible pulmonary embolism  a life-threatening complication of DVT. 3. Propose appropriate diagnostic tests (D-dimer blood test  Ultrasound  Venography  etc) 4. Propose a relevant management and treatment plan based on clinical guidelines  involving anticoagulant therapy and lifestyle changes to control risk factors. 5. Discuss the possibility of Preventive measures for DVT particularly in high-risk patients.  
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,21,Case Report  Patient Name: Ms. Linda Jones Age: 53 years Sex: Female Race: White Occupation: Corporate Lawyer  Residence: Chicago  Illinois Insurance: Private Insurance  Past Medical History: 1. Obesity (BMI 30.3) 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents for the last 5 years. 3. No history of any surgeries or hospitalizations. 4. Non-smoker and occasional alcohol use.  Family History: 1. Father passed away due to myocardial infarction. 2. Mother diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes. 3. Younger brother diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Presenting Complaints: 1. Gradual pain and swelling in the left calf for the last two weeks  which has been progressively increasing in intensity. 2. Warmth and redness over the area of pain and swelling in the left calf. 3. Shortness of breath started 2-3 days prior  more prominent when climbing stairs or doing other exertions. 4. Palpitations intermittently  started around the same time as shortness of breath. 5. No history of trauma or injury to the leg. 6. No history of recent immobilization or travel. 7. No history of chest pain  syncope  or loss of consciousness.  Taking into consideration that DVT is twice common among people older than 50 years  and the incidence rates are higher in females  the patient's demographics are designed. Ms. Jones's occupation indicates a prolonged sitting duration increasing the risk for DVT  and attributes like obesity and her diabetes history are common risk factors for the same. Her family history of cardiovascular ailments and diabetes further justifies the risks. Her symptoms are classic for DVT and possibly a pulmonary embolism: the most serious complication of DVT.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,22,Case Report  Subject: Training Case for Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:   The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  named Michael  who is a retired office worker. He is slightly overweight with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 27. Michael is a former two-pack-a-day smoker but quit a decade ago.   Past Medical History:  He had a history of right leg total knee arthroplasty about a year ago due to osteoarthritis. He also suffers from chronic hypertension  controlled with daily medication. His family history discloses his father’s death from a pulmonary embolism at age 75.  Presenting Complaints:  Michael presents with complaints of a red  warm  swollen  progressively painful right lower leg which started two days ago. He denies any injury  insect bite  or rash. He feels a slight shortness of breath when walking  but no chest pain. However  due to current COVID-19 pandemic  he delayed his hospital visit. His last long travel was his tour to Europe six months ago.  Background:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) occurs more frequently with increasing age  with a reported annual incidence of ~1 per 1 000 persons in the general population. It has previously been associated with a personal history of venous thromboembolism  recent surgery or trauma  malignancy  pregnancy  estrogen use  certain genetic conditions  prolonged immobility  and increasing age. Obesity and smoking are also considered risk factors. A DVT which affects the leg can cause symptoms such as pain  swelling  redness  warmth  and a heavy ache.  This case report of a 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of knee arthroplasty  hypertension  former smoker  and overweight status represent typical risk factors for DVT. Participants should be prompted to initially consider a DVT in the differential diagnosis due to these factors and presenting symptoms.   This case aims to provide requisite knowledge and understanding for medical students about the risk factors  signs  symptomatology  and diagnostic approach of Deep Vein Thrombosis as it is a highly prevalent and potentially fatal condition if not diagnosed and managed efficiently. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,23,"Case Report:   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  non-smoker. She reported that she is sedentary most of the time and socially drinks alcohol. She is a widower with three grandchildren. She lives alone but has a support network of friends and family. She is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds  with a BMI of 27.5  which is considered overweight.   Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with lisinopril. She also has type 2 diabetes managed with metformin and diet control. She has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which she takes atorvastatin. The patient has no known drug allergies. She reported no previous surgeries or hospitalizations. Her mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis.   Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of gradually worsening pain and swelling in her left lower leg. The swelling is localized and does not extend to the entire leg. She also reported warmth over her calf. She has not experienced any symptoms such as chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or fainting. She denied recent travel  surgery  or immobilization.   This case report is intended to represent the fact that the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases with age. According to the NCBI  """"two-thirds of all VTE events occur in individuals aged 60 and over"""" with the occurrence being slightly higher in females. The patient’s older age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and genetic predisposition (mother with DVT history) make her more prone to DVT. Furthermore  her chronic conditions such as hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  which are common in the older population  give an opportunity to discuss the potential risks and complications in such patients."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,24,Patient Case for Clinical Training: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Presentation: Patient: Mr. Johnson  Age: 62 years old Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Patient's Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. He is also a former smoker and quit smoking 5 years ago. He has a BMI of 28 and has been labeled as overweight.  According to his records  Mr. Johnson had a minor heart attack two years ago  for which he was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Mr. Johnson's medication history includes that he is on metformin for diabetes  atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and low-dose aspirin  which was started following his heart attack.   Patient's Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson is presenting in the Emergency Department with a complaint of sudden onset  unilateral  severe calf pain and swelling in his right lower leg. He notes that the swelling has worsened over the last three to four days  so much so that it's hindering his mobility now. He also mentions that the leg feels warm to the touch and he's noted a slight change in the skin color to a reddish-blue tinge. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or any recent travels or immobilization.  Mr. Johnson's wife  who accompanied him to the hospital  noted that he's seemed increasingly fatigued over the past week  something unusual for him.  Summary: This case is of a 62-year-old overweight male who has a history of type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and previous myocardial infarction. He presented with typical symptoms indicative of a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). These include calf pain  limb swelling  warmth  and discoloration all localized to one leg  specifically the lower limb. His risk factors include his age  obesity  and his medical history. This case is meant to highlight the presentation  risk factors  and management of a DVT  as well as the potential for serious complications  such as pulmonary embolisms  which this patient is at higher risk for given his cardiac history.    Note: While the patient hasn't mentioned any recent travels or immobilization  it's crucial to remember that medical history often involves details that can sometimes be overlooked or forgotten  and these could potentially alter the management and outcomes dramatically.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,25,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information: -The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe. -He is a retired postal worker  currently living with his wife in a suburban area. He has a 35-pack-year history of smoking but has no known alcohol or illicit drug use.  -His family history is significant for stroke in his father at the age of 70 and myocardial infarction in his mother at the age of 65.  Past Medical History: -John has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 7 years.  -He is currently on oral antihypertensive medication (Amlodipine Besylate) and oral antidiabetic medication (Metformin).  -No previous surgical history is present. -John is a frequent traveler and recently returned from a transatlantic flight 4 days prior to presenting to the hospital. -He does not engage in physical activity regularly and is predominantly a sedentary individual.  Presenting Complaints: -John's primary complaint is a swollen  reddish  and painful left lower limb that has been worsening over the past two days.  -He also mentions experiencing a mild shortness of breath. However  he denies any associated chest pain  light-headedness  palpitations  or cough. -He acknowledges that he hasn’t been drinking adequate fluids during his recent travel.  Based on strong epidemiological evidence  John's age  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  recent long-distance travel  and current symptoms point towards a high index of suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The mild shortness of breath could indicate a possible pulmonary embolism  which is a known complication of DVT. The case should focus on the appropriate diagnostic workup and treatment plan for DVT alongside engaging students in the discussion of patient education on risk factor modification and disease prevention. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,26,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Patient Name: Ms. Johnson  Age: 55 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian (White) Occupation: Office worker (sedentary job)  Past Medical History: Ms. Johnson has a past medical history of obesity (BMI 32)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She is a former smoker who quit about 10 years back and has no known blood clot or bleeding disorders. She uses an estrogen-progestogen combined oral contraceptive. She is not diabetic  does not consume alcohol and she has no family history of thromboembolic diseases. Two years ago  she had an arthroscopic knee surgery. Postoperatively  she developed deep vein thrombosis which was treated with anticoagulation therapy. The patient did not have any recurrent thrombotic events post-therapy.  Key Complaints:  In the past week  Ms. Johnson has been experiencing discomfort in her left calf. The discomfort has gradually worsened  and it is now a dull aching pain in her whole leg. The left calf also seems to have become swollen in comparison to the right. She reports no warmth or redness over the area but notices that her left leg appears to have become slightly discolored  obtaining a bluish hue. She has no associated chest pain  shortness of breath  or any other systemic symptoms.  It's important to note that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disorder  with incidence rates in the general population of around 1-2 per 1000 individuals annually  but the risks are higher in older people (aged > 60 years)  and those with certain risk factors (e.g.  obesity  immobility  surgery  trauma  malignancy  pregnancy  or certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias).    Case based on these demographics and symptoms suggests a likely recurrence of deep vein thrombosis. Factors that would make the diagnosis likely includes her sedentary lifestyle  the use of combined oral contraceptives and her history of a prior DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,27,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics:  Ms. Fernandez  a 67-year-old Hispanic female  retired school teacher living in Santa Ana  California along with her 70 years old husband  who is her primary caregiver. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Past Medical History/Relevant Family History: Ms. Fernandez has a validated medical history of obesity (BMI 32.2 kg/m2)  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hypothyroidism. She has been compliant with her medication regimen including Metformin  Lisinopril  and Levothyroxine. She also reports a family history of cardiovascular disease  as her father had a cardiac bypass surgery in his 60s  and her mother  who died at 72  suffered from stroke.  Key Complaints: Ms. Fernandez presented to the clinic with a principal complaint of increasing discomfort  warmth  and swelling in her left leg that she noted 2 days ago. The symptoms progressed  with the pain growing worse when she tried to move her foot. She also mentioned recent mild shortness of breath that started roughly at the same time as the leg pain. However  she denied chest pain  cough  seizures  fever  or recent trauma. She also mentioned she hasn't been able to exercise for the past few weeks and has spent most of her time sitting due to the ongoing pandemic and her fear of exposure.  Learning Points: 1. The clinical presentation of Ms. Fernandez indicates symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) associated with several risk factors like advanced age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and other comorbidities. Studies show that Hispanics are less likely to develop DVT than non-Hispanic whites  but there are several individual factors beyond race/ethnicity contributing to her risk. 2. The presence of shortness of breath alongside symptoms of DVT could indicate a possible pulmonary embolism  which warrants urgent diagnostic testing. 3. It’s important to take a patient-centered approach when deciding on testing and treatment. It should involve discussions around risks  benefits  and patient preferences. 4. The importance of DVT prevention strategies  particularly in those deemed to be high risk  should be emphasized to further reduce the incidence and subsequent morbidity and mortality associated with DVT and PE. 5. Patient education and awareness about maintaining a balanced diet and active lifestyle even during pandemic restrictions would be beneficial in managing obesity  diabetes  and reducing the risk of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,28,Subjec: DVT  Patient Information: Name: Mrs. Maria Gonzalez Age: 65 years old Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic  Past Medical History: Mrs. Gonzalez has significant history of: 1. Hypertension for 10 years - currently on Lisinopril 10mg. 2. Type II diabetes for over 13 years - managed by Metformin. 3. Recently had an elective total knee replacement surgery 1 week ago.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Gonzalez visited the ER complaining of acute onset pain and swelling in her right lower leg that has been progressively worsening over the last 1-2 days. The pain increases when she tries to flex or extend her leg. She has rated the pain at an 8/10 severity. She denies any associated chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or lightheadedness. She has been noncompliant with her post-operative leg exercises and inappropriately discontinuing her prophylactic anticoagulants.  Rationale: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is most common in elderly patients  especially in postoperative periods (as in our case of knee replacement surgery). Factors such as obesity  history of previous DVT  immobilization  malignancy  history of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth  recent trauma or surgery  and oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy use risk factors for DVT. This medical case is a demonstration of both underlying risk factors  i.e.  obesity  past surgery and age-related slower recovery along with patient's non-compliance to anticoagulation as a trigger factor. Although DVT can occur in any ethnicity  Caucasians and African Americans are generally at higher risk. However  it is essential to remember that it can happen in any racial or ethnic group  as in our patient of Hispanic ethnicity.   Additionally  this case allows the students to practice their diagnostic and clinical decision-making skills. The teaching case provides the opportunity to discuss the risk and factors for developing DVT  to explore the symptoms and signs of DVT  and to identify the need for immediate treatment. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,29,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Patient Name: James Thompson Age: 63 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired civil servant Marital Status: Married State of Residence: North Carolina  Past Medical History: - Hyperlipidemia treated with statins - Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin - History of smoking – 1 pack daily for 30 years  quit 10 years ago - Sedentary lifestyle  - No previous surgeries - No known drug allergies  Key Complaints: The patient presents with a 2-day history of swelling  redness  and persistent pain in the left calf  rating the pain as 7 on a scale of 1-10  making it hard for him to walk. No reported fever or recent trauma. No chest pain  dyspnea  palpitations  syncope  or other systemic symptoms. Concerned about the sudden onset  he consulted due to his family’s history of cardiovascular diseases.   Clinical Findings: On examination  the left calf is visibly swollen and warm to touch with mild erythema. He has a palpable cord along the distribution of the left popliteal vein. The Homans' sign is positive. His vitals are stable  and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Note: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) has a higher incidence in men than women  and the risk increases with age. DVT most frequently occurs in patients aged 60-80. Caucasians are more frequently affected than any other racial group.   To present a balanced demographic representation  subsequent cases should introduce patients from different racial backgrounds  sexes  and age groups.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,30,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics:  - Name: Mr. Johnson - Age: 69 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian (This demographic has been selected based on studies indicating higher prevalence rates of DVT among the population of white race.) - Occupation: Retired Bank Manager - Place of Residence: Urban area  Past Medical History:  - BMI: 33 (Obese) - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Hypertension - Hypothyroidism - Former smoker (quit 5 years ago) - Underwent right hip replacement surgery a year ago  Key Complaints:  - Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department complaining of discomfort in his right leg  which has been progressive for the last three days. - He states that the pain grew increasingly worse  especially when standing or walking. - He further mentions experiencing unilateral leg swelling  redness  and warmth over the right calf area. - He denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness. - He said that he had been relatively sedentary recently  spending a lot of time sitting and reading due to being housebound given the pandemic situation. - Post-hip surgery  he had been on blood thinners but stopped taking them around six months back  on his own.  This case is designed to simulate a real-life scenario where a senior patient  following major orthopedic surgery with other risk factors like obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and non-compliance to anticoagulant therapy  presents with typical symptoms of DVT. It enables students to put into practice their knowledge and demonstrate their skills in history taking  examination  diagnosis  and prophylactic treatment of DVT. The case also highlights the importance of patient adherence to medication and post-surgery care  which are crucial aspects of managing chronic conditions. It will help in creating more engagement and awareness among students about the complexities of managing DVT in the clinical context.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,31,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 60-year old  overweight Hispanic male. He is a retired truck driver  married with three grown children  and lives in an urban setting. He is a moderate smoker for the last 30 years and consumes alcohol socially.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes and hypertension  which have been managed with medications for the last 10 years. Six months ago  he underwent a total knee replacement surgery following a severe fall. The post-surgery rehab consultation indicated that the patient was not fully compliant with physiotherapy. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his elder brother was diagnosed with DVT at age 58.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of swelling  redness  warmth  and pain in the calf of his right leg. The pain has been progressively worsening and is particularly noticeable when he tries to walk. He also reports having episodes of mild shortness of breath since yesterday. He notes that these symptoms have been causing significant discomfort and preventing him from carrying out his daily activities.   Clinical Suspicion:  There is a high likelihood of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the patient’s risk factors like his past major orthopedic surgery  prolonged immobility  obesity  advanced age  family history  and other comorbidities posed by diabetes and hypertension. The shortness of breath could indicate a possibility of a pulmonary embolism. An immediate diagnostic evaluation and if confirmed  follow-up treatment is necessary to prevent further life-threatening complications.  (Sources: Based on demographic representation from the American Journal of Medicine  Archives of Internal Medicine  and British Journal of Surgery).   **Please note that this case is an educational example and should not be used as a guide for real patient assessment or management. The management of each patient should be individualized after considering the appropriate history  physical examination findings  and diagnostic test results.**
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,32,Patient Case: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Scenario: A 60-year-old Caucasian male named Bob comes to the clinic complaining of swelling  pain  redness  and warmth in his left lower leg.  Demographics: The patient is married  retired  and lives in a suburban area. He is a former smoker  has a history of moderate alcohol use  but quit smoking 10 years ago.   Past Medical History: Bob has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medications. He has recently been on a long-haul flight of about 8 hours from Europe to the United States. He underwent right hip replacement surgery a year ago due to osteoarthritis. He reports he is not physically active and spends most of his time at home reading and watching television  which makes him relatively sedentary. His BMI is 28  marking him as overweight. Bob's father also experienced DVT in his early sixties.   Key Complaints: Bob describes his lower leg pain as a heavy ache or cramp that gets worse when he walks or flexes his foot. He further explains that the pain appeared suddenly  about two days ago. He says the swelling also appeared around the same time and has progressively worsened. The patient reports no fever  cough  chest pain  or shortness of breath. On examination  his left calf circumference is greater than his right calf.  Note: The demographic and history details highlight some of the common risk factors for DVT. These risk factors include age  obesity  immobility (due to surgery and sedentary lifestyle)  prolonged travel without movement  family history  and existence of other medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes. This scenario is designed to aid in diagnosing DVT and strategizing treatment according to the patient's unique risk factors and health conditions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,33,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 62-year-old African American male retired from his job as a truck driver and currently leading a slightly sedentary lifestyle. He is a smoker with a 45-pack year history.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and Type II diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  which is moderately controlled with oral hypoglycaemic agents. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. The patient had a hip replacement surgery 5 weeks ago and has been less active since then.  Key Complaints: The patient complains of having an increasing swelling  pain  and warmth in the left calf over the past 48 hours. He denies having any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. He has had no bleeding or bruising. He states he has been strictly adhering to his medication regimen.  Reason for Admission: Considering the patient's demographics  past medical history  lifestyle  and current complaints  he was admitted for a suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). No signs for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) were present  but it needs to be ruled out due to a common pathophysiology between DVT and PE.   Clinical evaluation  D-Dimer test  and compression ultrasonography can confirm the diagnosis. The sensitive nature of diagnosis and high-risk factors such as postoperative status  advanced age  African American descent  smoking history and the presence of comorbid conditions signify the severity of the case.  The clinical presentation of this patient aligns with the common demographic representation of DVT patients  as evidenced in the literature  which states that DVT is more prevalent in the elderly  smokers  postoperative patients  those with an inherited blood clot disorder  obese individuals and those with long-term health issues such as diabetes and hypertension.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,34,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis Training  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Margaret Davis  residing in an urban area. She is a retired teacher who lives independently. She reports a sedentary lifestyle with occasional walks around her neighborhood. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 28.3  suggestive of overweight. Her socio-economic status falls into the middle-income bracket.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Davis has a history of hypertension  for which she has been on medication (Losartan 50mg once daily)  and recurrent varicose veins for which she has had two surgeries in the past. She also has a 15-year history of smoking  although she ceased completely 5 years ago. She does not report any history of cancer  autoimmune or hematological disorders. She has not had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations  and she has no known drug allergies.   Furthermore  she has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; her mother passed away due to a myocardial infarction and a paternal grandmother who suffered from a stroke. She is up-to-date with all necessary immunizations for her age group and receives regular preventive care.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Davis presents with complaints of increasing pain  warmth  and swelling in her left leg  particularly in the calf  for over a week. She denies any trauma or injury to the region. She also reports experiencing intermittent shortness of breath and light-headedness in the past three days. She does not report chest pain or heart palpitations. Her symptoms seem to be getting progressively worse  which prompted her to seek medical attention.  Validity Note: The chosen patient's demographics and health concerns were designed mindful of data indicating that older  overweight females are among those with higher risks for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Moreover  conditions such as hypertension and varicose veins  history of smoking  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of cardiovascular diseases make her an appropriate candidate for a DVT scenario. Incorporating these specific details aims to provide realistic and practical case training for medical students studying DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,35,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics:   - Name: Mr. Luis Gonzales - Age: 51 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Hispanic - Occupation: Long-haul truck driver - Place of residence: New Mexico  USA  Past Medical History:  - Former smoker  quit 10 years ago - Moderate alcohol consumption - Body Mass Index (BMI): 32 (obese) - Hypertension  under treatment with beta-blockers - Family history of venous thromboembolism  Primary Complaint:   Mr. Gonzales has reported experiencing a dull  aching pain in his left lower leg for the past four days. The pain intensifies when standing or walking. Upon examination  localized warmth  erythema  and edema are noticed in the left calf region. There is no associated chest pain or shortness of breath. However  he recalls two recent events where he was immobilized for extended periods due to his job. First  he had a cross-country delivery assignment two weeks ago and recently  a breakdown scenario led to sitting for prolonged periods in his truck.   Considering the patient's profiles and symptoms  this could be a case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Various risk factors such as prolonged immobility  obesity  former smoking  and a family history of venous thromboembolism collectively precipitate the possibility of this diagnosis.  If literature is referred  DVT is commonly seen in individuals aged 40 and above  with increasing age being a strong risk factor. Men have slightly greater risks than women. Further  long-haul truck drivers are at higher risk due to prolonged immobilized state during long routes. Obesity  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  and usage of certain medicines also contribute to increased risk. In Mr. Gonzales's case  these demographics and risk factors are accurately represented. Furthermore  his Hispanic ethnicity warrants consideration because literature suggests that there is a lower prevalence of DVT in Hispanic populations compared to other ethnic groups which could lead to potential underdiagnosis  reinforcing the need for a high index of suspicion.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,36,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  **Patient Demographics:**  Name: Mr. Hampton Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired  Location: North Carolina  USA  **Past Medical History:**  Mr. Hampton has a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. He also has a 20-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. The patient underwent total knee arthroplasty three months prior  and he also reports a family history of pulmonary embolism.  **Presenting Complaints:**  The patient came to the emergency department reporting a three-day history of progressive left calf pain with associated swelling and mild warmness. He hasn't faced any traumatic injury recently. The symptoms worsened during the periods when he had to sit for a prolonged duration. He also complained of a slight shortness of breath.  **Physical Examination:**  On examination  he had a temperature of 98.6°F  blood pressure of 135/88 mmHg  a pulse rate of 84 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. His left lower leg was noticeably swollen with mild erythema. Popliteal and calf tenderness were noted on palpation of the left leg.   The case thus elaborates the clinical presentation of a patient suspected of Deep Vein Thrombosis. The subsequent learning and teaching will revolve around pathophysiology  risk factors (including sedentary lifestyle post-surgery  age  smoking  hypertension  diabetes)  necessary clinical assessments  diagnostic strategies (like D-dimer  compression ultrasound)  treatment options (anticoagulation therapy)  prevention strategies  and potential complications evolving from DVT (like pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,37,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  - Patient Initials: J.S. - Age: 68 years - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaints: Swelling  pain  redness  and warmth in the right lower leg  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 3. Hypercholesterolemia  Detailed Past Medical History: The patient  J.S.  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and hypertension 6 years ago  controlled in both cases via oral medication. She was also diagnosed with Hypercholesterolemia 1 year ago  maintained with dietary changes and medication.  J.S. is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago but smoked 1 pack a day for 40 years. She maintains a BMI within the obese range  despite dietary changes. She is a retired school teacher and now leads a sedentary lifestyle. She reported a long plane journey of about 12 hours approximately 10 days ago. No known allergies reported.  She has no history of cancer  heart disease  or genetic blood disorders. No family history of clotting disorders  though her father and a brother both suffered from cardiovascular diseases.  The patient has been on oral antihypertensive medication (amlodipine) and oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin). For her cholesterol  she’s been taking atorvastatin.  Key Complaints: J.S. attended the clinic with complaints of a painful  swollen right lower leg that had been progressively worsening over the last few days. The skin over her leg was warm to touch and slightly reddish. She also mentioned a mild fever and general fatigue. She has no complaint of chest pain  shortness of breath  hemoptysis  or similar symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion: Considering J.S.'s age  obesity  recent lengthy travel  sedentary lifestyle  and history of smoking  there might be a high index of suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Further investigations (like Doppler ultrasonography  D-dimer levels) and management should be done based on clinical guidelines.  Note: This case was built based on data stating higher DVT prevalence in individuals over 60  female gender  Caucasian race  and those with co-morbid conditions  including hypertension  obesity  diabetes  and a history of smoking. Also  long duration travels are a known risk for DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,38,"Case Report on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: JM  a 60-year-old African American male  working as a truck driver for 25 years  presents for an office visit. He is a former smoker and quit smoking about five years ago. He lives with his wife in a suburban area. He has a BMI of 32  which means he falls in the obese category. Recent literature indicates that this demographic tends to have a somewhat higher risk of DVT  with obesity  advanced age and prolonged immobility as major risk factors.  Past Medical History: Mr. M has a medical history of type 2 diabetes  for which he is controlling with diet  exercise  and metformin. He has hypertension well-controlled with lisinopril. He does not have any known genetic clotting disorders but has a family history of DVT with his father. His surgical history is unremarkable; he had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to cholelithiasis with no complications. He takes aspirin 81 mg daily as prophylaxis for cardiovascular health. He denies any drug allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. M presents with complaints of progressive left calf pain over the last four days  which is worsened by standing and walking and relieves partially on elevation. He noticed it first after sitting for a prolonged period at his office desk. He also reported swelling of the same calf and mild warmth around the region. He denies experiencing any recent trauma  chest pain  shortness of breath  or other major complaints.  Evaluating these complaints and considering his risk factors (obesity  prolonged immobility due to his job  older age  family history of DVT); a hypothesis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is highly suspected. A comprehensive diagnostic and management plan is essential to avoid associated complications like pulmonary embolism. This case would further train medical students on how to approach and manage such patients effectively.    Reference: - """"Risk factors for venous thromboembolism"""".

He also underwent a hip replacement surgery 6 months prior due to a motor vehicle accident and has also been treated for mild lower extremity peripheral artery disease two years ago. Mr. Harris is also an active smoker for the last 30 years and lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Harris presents with a three-day history of increasing pain  swelling  and warmth in his right calf. Today  he noticed increasing redness and the calf has become substantially swollen and tender. He denies trauma but notes prolonged periods of sitting due to recent cross-country car travel.  This case has been designed to provide a realistic and comprehensive case scenario of deep vein thrombosis in the context of the patient's demographics and medical history. As per the literature  the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis is higher in older adults (above 60)  with risk factors including prior surgery  prolonged periods of immobilization  and an active smoking history. This case report will enable medical students to understand the key signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis  appreciate the significance of a patient’s lifestyle  the impact of previous medical history and take into consideration the risk factors while diagnosing and suggesting appropriate treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,40,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. X  Age: 59 Sex: Male Ethnic Background: Caucasian  Occupation: Long-haul truck driver Location: Midwest  United States Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle  smoking pack a day for the past 40 years  overweight (BMI: 30)  Past Medical History: He has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 5 years  maintained on Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he takes Metformin. No history of allergies or surgical procedures is reported.

Presenting Complaints: Mr. X presents to the hospital with complaints of progressive left leg pain and mild swelling that has persisted over the last three days. The swelling looks more pronounced towards the end of the day. He also shares that his leg feels unusually warm to touch and slightly red. He denies having chest pain  breathing difficulty  recent trauma  or surgery.   The case aims to train medical students on identifying  diagnosing  and managing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). High suspicion of DVT should be maintained because of the patient's advanced age  sedentary job  obesity  smoking habit  and history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Diabetes Mellitus  all of which are factors that increase the risk for deep vein thrombosis. This case will require understanding of how to conduct a physical examination  order appropriate diagnostic testing  and consider possible treatment options for the management of DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,41,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Office job  sedentary lifestyle  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history that includes hypertension  obesity (BMI 33)  and type-2 diabetes  which is being managed with lifestyle adjustments and medication (Insulin). She is a former smoker  quitting about 5 years ago after 30 years of smoking. She is also on oral contraceptives for menopausal symptoms. She has had no previous episodes of DVT or pulmonary embolism  and no known family history of coagulation disorders. Recently the patient had fractured her ankle which has limited her mobility significantly.  Key Complaints: On presentation  the patient complained of:  - Pain and swelling in her right calf over the past two days  growing progressively worse. - The calf is warm compared to the other leg and appears slightly red. - Mild shortness of breath  but no chest pain. - No fainting episodes. - No other areas of swelling or discomfort.  Reporting this case study prompts the learners to identify and understand risk factors of deep vein thrombosis such as obesity  age  prolonged immobility  hormone therapy  smoking past  and co-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension. The main focus is to recognize the signs and symptoms of DVT  adopt appropriate diagnostic procedures  and manage the condition effectively.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,42,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information:   Mr. James Walsh  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  is a retired truck driver who lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago. He is generally healthy  with only mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications rather than medications. He has no known drug allergies  and his BMI is within the healthy range. His father had a history of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE).   Chief Complaints:  Mr. Walsh reports an aching  cramping pain in his right calf that began suddenly five days ago. He says the pain is sometimes severe and worsens when he walks. He also reports mild swelling and redness in the same leg. He notes no chest pain  shortness of breath  or fainting  indicating no apparent symptoms of PE. However  he admits to sitting for prolonged hours in his hobby of bird-watching with little leg movement.  Emphasizing Factors:  The patient’s age  sedentary lifestyle  and the family history of DVT and PE should be highlighted in this case as these are significant risk factors for DVT. Also  consider the fact that DVT often presents with non-specific symptoms  so a high level of suspicion is necessary. The apparent lack of PE symptoms should not exclude DVT.   Note:  Real-life patient populations may vary  but this concise case study encompasses the majority of risk factors associated with DVT. According to literature  DVT is most common in adults over 60 and in people with prolonged immobility  major surgery or trauma  cancer  pregnancy  estrogen use  previous DVT or PE  and certain inherited or acquired disorders that affect blood clotting. It should be noted that DVT can also occur in individuals who don't fall within these risk factors  particularly those with underlying genetic predispositions. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,43,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Smith presented with sudden onset swelling  redness  warmth  and pain in his left lower extremity  specifically in the calf muscles. He complained of a heavy ache which intensified when he stood or walked.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a past medical history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and Stage 1 Chronic Kidney Disease. He is a former smoker  having quit five years ago  but has a 30 pack-year smoking history. He reports a sedentary lifestyle and Recently  he had a total knee replacement surgery on the left side. Additionally  he holds a personal history of a myocardial infarction 8 years prior.  Social History:  Mr. Smith is retired and lives alone  although nearby to his daughter and her family. He admits to frequent alcohol use  usually about two beers every evening.  Family History:  His father died of a myocardial infarction  his mother was diabetic  and one of his sisters suffered from a pulmonary embolism.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination revealed  in the left leg  an edematous calf  with erythema and localized warmth. Popliteal and pedal pulses were palpable. No changes in consciousness  breath sounds are clear to auscultation without any wheezes or crackles  and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with a regular rhythm and no murmurs.  Summary:  This case focuses on a 65-year-old Caucasian male  with a surgical history and sedentary lifestyle  who has presented with symptoms suggesting deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's age  prior surgery  personal and family history showcase an elevated risk for thromboembolic diseases  including DVT and its potential to progress into a pulmonary embolism. Considering the patient's age and demographics  this scenario is consistent with literature reporting individuals over 60 years  specifically postoperative  sedentary individuals  as being more susceptible to developing DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,44,Patient Information: Mrs. Dorothy Fisher  65-year-old African American female.   Past Medical History: Hypertension  Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (on Metformin)  past smoker (quit 10 years prior)  and morbid obesity.  Chief Complaints: Mrs. Fisher presents to the emergency department reporting a 3-day history of increasing left calf pain and swelling. She states that the pain is constant and describes it as a deep ache. She also mentions intermittent sensations of heat in the leg. She denies any recent lower extremity trauma  recent surgeries  or long-distance flights.  In order to complete the case  this additional information can be considered:  Family History: Mrs. Fisher's older sister reportedly suffered from a blood clot in her 70s.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mrs. Fisher’s left calf appears markedly swollen  red  and warm to touch compared to the right. There is a tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system.  Investigations: Coagulation screening + D-Dimer test  Doppler Ultrasound of lower extremity  Chest X-ray in order rule out Pulmonary Embolism.  Concepts to Discuss: Process of diagnosing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  consideration of differential diagnoses (Baker's cyst  cellulitis)  risk factors for DVT (e.g. obesity  older age  personal or family history of DVT or PE  African American race  and presence of co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes)  importance of DVT prophylaxis  treatment strategies such as anticoagulation therapy  and potential complications like a pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome.  NOTE: This case representation is illustrated based on the demographic and comorbidity factors associated with increased risk of developing DVT  as mentioned in several studies. This case does not aim to stereotype or stigmatize any racial group. The aim is to provide a training case for medical students to understand and gain insights into DVT management and patient care effectively. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,45,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographics:  Patient X is a 68-year-old African-American male  married  a retired accountant  and lives alone in Trenton  New Jersey. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol use.   Past Medical History: Patient X has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago. Both conditions are well-managed with medication (lisinopril for hypertension and metformin for diabetes). He also occasionally takes ibuprofen for arthritis pain. His surgical history includes a unilateral total knee replacement surgery 6 years ago due to osteoarthritis. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 72  and his brother had a stroke at age 70.  Key Complaints: For the past week  Patient X has been experiencing increasing pain and swelling in his right lower leg. He reports it as a constant  dull ache that intensifies when he stands up or walks. He notes that his right calf appears to be visibly larger than his left calf and has become somewhat red and warm to the touch. He denies any recent injuries to the area. He also reports feeling a bit short of breath for the past 3 days  which he initially attributed to his age and lack of exercise. He has no chest pain  palpitations  or syncope. He did mention recent bouts of moderate to severe night sweats.   Given the patient's demographic and past history of knee replacement surgery  there is a high index of suspicion for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  since this is seen more frequently in African-Americans  the elderly  and those with a history of surgery or immobilization. The newly developed shortness of breath when considered in combination with the potential DVT could indicate possible pulmonary embolism  a serious complication. Therefore  this case necessitates urgent and suitable investigations and interventions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,46,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information Name: John Smith Age: 60 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired corporate accountant (sedentary lifestyle) Residence: Urban environment  Northwest USA  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension and type-2 diabetes 5 years ago  both of which are being managed by medication. He also had a right total knee replacement surgery 2 weeks ago due to osteoarthritis. Smith was a smoker for over 30 years  but quit 7 years ago. He lives alone and has no known allergies.   Key Complaints: The patient visited the emergency department complaining of increasingly severe pain in his right calf  which started a few days ago. He also noted swelling in the calf with redness and warmth over the area. The patient reported no chest pain or shortness of breath but mentioned some discomfort while walking. He has no fever or pointing symptoms suggestive of infection at the surgical site. His calf was mildly edematous  but not grossly swollen.   Note: DVT is more common in older adults (especially those over 60 years old)  and this patient's age  previous surgery  and less mobile lifestyle further increase the risk. Caucasians tend to be at increased risk  specifically those with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. The risk of DVT can also increase after an orthopedic surgery  such as a total knee replacement. It is important  as medical students  to consider these risk factors when evaluating a patient's symptoms and medical history.   Next steps in this case would involve a DVT risk assessment  a physical exam  and likely some diagnostic tests such as a D-dimer test  or a Duplex ultrasound.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,47,Case Report - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Background: This case is designed to help medical students practice diagnosing and managing Deep Vein Thrombosis. It also highlights the importance of assessing risk factors for the development of DVT.  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 62-year-old African-American female. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband.  Past medical history:  The patient has been diagnosed previously with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She is currently on medication for both with generally good control. She underwent a right total knee arthroplasty 4 weeks ago. She has a smoking history of 20 years  and ceased 5 years ago. She reports no known drug allergies.   Key complaints: She presents with a 3-day history of progressive right lower leg swelling and moderate pain  along with the leg feeling warm to touch. She denies any trauma to the lower extremity. She states the discomfort is hamstring and calf pain which feels “deep” and is made worse with walking or ankle flexion. There are no other associated symptoms such as chest pain  shortness of breath  or changes in skin color.  Summary: This case is aimed at teaching students how to evaluate and manage a potentially life-threatening condition - deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's age  race  sex  surgical history  chronic conditions  and former smoking habit present a realistic scenario  as these are common risk factors associated with DVT. Postoperative patients  particularly after hip or knee arthroplasty  have a significantly increased risk of developing DVT. The patient's complaints of deep leg pain  limb swelling  and warmth further suggest the likelihood of this diagnosis. Following the case  clinical evaluation  imaging  and management plans can be discussed.   Additional emphasis can be given to the importance of recognizing the potentially fatal complication of pulmonary embolism  which can result if DVT is not diagnosed promptly and treated correctly.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,48,Case Report:  Patient Information: Name: Mrs. Emma Martinez Age: 74 Sex: Female Race: Hispanic  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for 15 years  controlled with medications. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  managed with oral hypoglycemics. 3. Hyperlipidemia for 8 years  managed with diet and statin therapy.  4. Treated breast cancer  post-chemotherapy and radiation 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Martinez presented with swelling  pain  and redness in her left leg that developed over the past two days. She added that she had restricted mobility due to pain and tenderness. The patient also mentioned having a low-grade fever.  Discussion Points: 1. Primarily  the learner should identify the risk factors for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  i.e.  age  history of cancer  immobility  etc. They should understand that Mrs. Martinez’s medical history places her at an elevated risk of blood clot development. 2. Next  understanding the typical presentation of DVT will involve identification of the symptoms Mrs. Martinez has presented with  which are classic symptoms of DVT. 3. The learner should focus on identifying appropriate diagnostic tests for identification of DVT. 4. Lastly  case discussion will center around understanding the first-line of treatment and management for DVT along with prevention measures.  The intent of this case is to provide the learner a holistic understanding of DVT  its risk factors  presentation  diagnostic measures  and treatment protocols. The case representation is accurate as per demographic data  showing that DVT often occurs in older adults and is more prevalent in individuals with a history of cancer. The patient also has other medical conditions that independently increase her risk profile. These comorbidities are common in real life settings  adding authentic learning value to the case study.

Teaching Note: The case highlights common risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) such as age  obesity  recent immobility due to injury/accident  past history of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation  and smoking. The presentation with unilateral leg symptoms points towards DVT though confirmation and further management will require processing investigations like D-Dimer blood test  Ultrasound or venogram if required  along with patient's management for controlling symptoms and preventing further complications like pulmonary embolism.  This case allows learning on the importance of risk stratification based on clinical probability of DVT  use of Wells score for DVT  understanding and interpreting investigations for DVT  lifestyle modifications  management strategies  and complications of deep vein thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,50,Case Subject: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: Mr. Henry Santos  African-American male  aged 56  blue-collar worker involved in heavy lifting tasks at a construction site. He lives with his wife and two kids in downtown Detroit  Michigan and is a smoker for the last 35 years. He is 5’9’’  weighs 240 lbs  BMI- 35.5 (obese).  Past Medical History: Mr. Santos has a background of Hypertension for the last 12 years  controlled on medication and has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases. He also has known Type 2 Diabetes mellitus moderately controlled on oral hypoglycemics. Apart from these  he has led a relatively healthy life  with no major surgeries  injuries or known allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Santos presents to the ER with a 2-day history of painful  swollen right lower leg. He first noticed the symptoms while doing his normal routine physical activities. He recalls carrying heavy loads and a slight stumble but denied any notable injuries. He also reported a dull aching pain in his leg which increased over time. The pain is not radiating and does not alter with the change in position.  During the past 24 hours  the lower leg pain got worse  and the leg has become significantly red and warm. Additionally  the patient reported mild shortness of breath on exertion. However  he has no complaints of chest pain  coughing  hemoptysis  or fever. He also mentioned increasing fatigue and unexplained weight loss during the last few weeks. The patient also complained of occasional night sweats. He denies any recent travel  stays mostly sedentary at home  and follows an unhealthy diet.  Note: This case represents a higher-risk demographic particularly susceptible to DVT considering factors like age  race  obesity  smoking habits  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  and Diabetes. All these factors are consistent with specific demographic data found in related literature. The combination of these predispositions and the patient's key symptoms outlines a clinical scenario potentially indicative of Deep Vein Thrombosis(DVT).
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,51,Case Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in Postmenopausal Woman   Patient Information:  - Name: Mrs. Anita Smith (Pseudonym) - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher - Marital Status: Widowed   Patient Medical History: - Diagnosis with Hypertension - 15 years ago  managed with medication (amlodipine) - Diagnosis with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - 5 years ago  managed with medication (metformin) - Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis - Managed with NSAIDs - Surgical History: Total knee arthroplasty of the right knee - 2 years ago - Marital History: No use of contraceptives; 2 pregnancies with routine deliveries - Postmenopausal: On Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)  Patient Complaints: Mrs. Smith has come in complaining of a painful  swollen left calf which she noted 3 days ago. She describes the pain as a constant  dull ache that worsens with movement and is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medication. She also reports feeling generally unwell and a bit more lethargic than usual  but denies any fever  chest pain  or breathlessness.  Note: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is often seen in elderly patients  particularly postmenopausal women  due to the hypercoagulable state induced by hormone replacement therapy. Additionally  the presence of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes  along with previous history of surgery and potentially immobility  contribute to the risk factors for DVT. Therefore  Mrs. Smith's case accurately represents the typical demographic and medical profile for DVT.

He is a retired construction worker  married with four grown-up children. He is a smoker with a 35-pack year history. Resides in an urban area  with low socioeconomic status. Patient has not traveled recently and denies alcohol use.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Leonard has a known history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last 15 years  hypertension for about 12 years  and a recent hip replacement surgery six weeks prior to the current evaluation. The patient has been on Metformin and Lisinopril respectively for his conditions. He is also obese with a BMI of 31.7 and a family history of stroke.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Leonard visited the hospital complaining of progressive left lower leg pain and swelling for the past four days. He also mentioned a mild fever for around the same period. Strikingly  his left calf is markedly swollen and warm when compared to his right and shows a positive Homan's sign. He also reported feeling slightly breathless over the past two days. His vitals showed marginally increased heart rate.   Evaluation:  Upon evaluation  the clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis was raised due to postoperative status  continuous smoking despite comorbidities  advanced age  obesity  and the patient's demographics. The patient was subjected to immediate diagnostics and interventions including Doppler ultrasonography or venography  as necessary.  Summary:  This case presents medical students with a high-risk patient for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  taking into account common risk factors such as age  recent surgery  a history of smoking  obesity  and pre-existing prothrombotic conditions. It also represents accurate demographic representation considering DVT being common among African-Americans. This case aims at honing the students' skills in identifying DVTs in their early stages  assessing the risk in different patient subsets  and managing them appropriately.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,61,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a retired factory worker residing in the urban northeast. He is a smoker with a 40-pack year history and has been classified as overweight with a BMI of 27 kg/m2. He resides in a single-story house with his wife.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes which is poorly controlled with Metformin. He also has moderate hypertension controlled with Losartan. He also has hyperlipidemia and is on simvastatin. He has had several hospitalizations over the past two years due to flare-ups of his Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The patient also had an outpatient knee arthroplasty around six weeks ago.  Key Complaints:  The patient reports increasing left lower leg pain and progressive swelling for the past four days and has noticed a bluish discoloration to his skin. He denies any trauma  fever  chest pain  dyspnea  or symptoms in the other extremity. There is no previous history of DVT or pulmonary embolism  but he does admit to reduced activity due to recurrent COPD exacerbations. The patient’s wife states he has been less active since his knee surgery.  Additional Evaluation:  Further investigation may reveal a hot  swollen  painful left calf more marked over the calf veins. Upon auscultation  scattered wheezes  and crackles may be present in both lungs. It is also likely that blood investigations will reveal raised D-dimer levels. Duplex Ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis may show non-compressibility of a deep calf vein  localizing the DVT.  Creating a DVT case study around these patient demographics and key complaints will help increase student awareness of this condition's risk factors  including age  surgery  prolonged immobilization  obesity  smoking  COPD  and uncontrolled diabetes. The management involves lifestyle modification  addressing modifiable risk factors  anticoagulation therapy  and lower extremity compression stocking  which can all be discussed when teaching about this case. This case will also teach students about the importance of adequate postoperative care and regular checkups for elderly patients. The complications of DVT (like pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome) can be also highlighted during the discussion on this case study.    Literature Citation:   [Microsoft Word - 5.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,66,Patient Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information:  - Age: 68 years - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired white-collar worker - Ethnicity: Caucasian (majority of DVT cases occur in this demographic as per literature) - Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity - Social history: Non-smoker  social alcohol consumption   Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of chronic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) along with Stage II hypertension (HTN). He had an open cholecystectomy 8 years ago and has been taking antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers) for hypertension ever since. The patient also has a family history of thrombotic diseases  his father having suffered from a pulmonary embolism.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented with unilateral  painful leg swelling on the left lower limb that began 4 days prior to consultation. The swelling was gradual in onset and has progressively worsened. He complains of a dull ache in the left calf and mild tenderness upon palpation. It is associated with a mild fever and redness of the skin over the swollen area. The patient was not able to identify any triggering or relieving factors for the pain and swelling.   He mentioned that he recently undertook a long-duration flight (12 hours  a potential risk factor for DVT) to visit his daughter and started experiencing symptoms soon after arrival. Patient reports minimal movement during flight and no preventative measures taken due to lack of awareness for thrombosis risk during long-haul flights.   This case presents a clear context for the discussion of Deep Vein Thrombosis risk factors  signs  and symptoms  diagnosis methods  and management strategies. It also encourages students to consider the importance of patient education in preventing severe health risks due to lifestyle or event-specific factors.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,67,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Anderson Age: 68 Years Sex: Male Race/ Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Insurance: Medicare Location: Urban dwelling in New York City  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a history of Type II diabetes mellitus  previous myocardial infarction  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago (40 pack year history). He has a past surgical history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 5 years ago. His daily medications include metformin  lisinopril  atorvastatin  and aspirin.  Key Complaint (Presenting Symptoms): The patient presents to the clinic with a 3-day history of a painful  swollen  and reddened left lower leg. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  loss of consciousness  or recent travels. He also denies trauma  insect bite  or known exposure to infection.   The literature often attributes DVT occurrence to prolonged immobility  major surgery  cancer  selected medications  and trauma. In the case of this patient  the past history of CABG might have a role in his current complaint. Males are not necessarily at higher risk for DVT but the age of this patient along with other comorbidities contribute significantly to the development of DVT.  This case has been designed to include an older age group who often present with comorbid conditions that increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The comorbidities were chosen with the goal of teaching how chronic diseases like diabetes  hypertension  and heart disease can be risk factors for DVT. These factors and the patient's past surgical history emphasize the importance of preventing prolonged immobilization in reducing the risk of DVT. The case allows for a potentially complex discussion around the management of an urgent but common medical condition intertwined with multiple chronic morbidities. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,68,"Case: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 60 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Long-distance truck driver Smoking Status: Retired smoker  Past Medical History: • Obesity (BMI - 35) • Type II diabetes mellitus • Hyperlipidemia • History of Proximal deep vein thrombosis five years prior  treated with anticoagulants • Hypertension • Stress-induced diagnosed depression  Presenting Complaints: John presents to the clinic with several days of progressive pain and discomfort in his left calf. He describes it as a """"pulling"""" sensation  and notes it is particularly noticeable when he moves his foot upward. He also acknowledges mild swelling in the left lower extremity and warmth over calf area. He denies any injury to his leg and doesn't recall any trauma.   John has been on the road for the past week  consistently driving for stretches of 10 hours and above. He's also been feeling more stressed lately due to multiple deadlines and less physical activity due to his job demands. He’s been under stress and his dieting and exercise routine has been neglected. He reports a weight gain of about 10lbs over the past 2 months.   He mentioned that he has been compliant with medications for diabetes  hyperlipidemia and hypertension but stopped taking his anticoagulant therapy two months ago due to concerns with bleeding risk. He does not have any issues with vision  breath shortness  chest pain  tingling sensation  or loss of consciousness.  This case will focus on deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The aim is to educate medical students about risk factors  screening  diagnosis  management strategies  and prevention of recurrence for DVT. The patient represents common risk factors seen in literature: previous history of DVT  prolonged immobility  obesity  hypertension  and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Additionally  this patient has multiple co-existing medical conditions often seen in real-world patients. Discussion will ensue on the balance of anticoagulation against bleeding risk  and the importance of lifestyle modifications along with medication compliance."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,69,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old African American woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 34 kg/m2 representing a common population at increased risk of DVT as indicated by research.  Past Medical History: She has a history of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (10 years duration)  Hypertension (5 years duration)  and was recently treated for breast cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and mastectomy six months ago. She has been relatively sedentary following her operations and is non-compliant with her post-cancer physiotherapy. She doesn’t smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally.   Key Complaints: She presented with a 3-day history of increasing pain and swelling in her right leg  especially the calf. She also complained of mild heaviness in her chest and difficulty in breathing for the past day which she initially thought was due to anxiety but has been steadily worsening. She rated her leg pain as being an 8/10 on the pain scale  with 10 being the most severe pain she has ever experienced  and described it as a 'deep throbbing ache' in her calf. She denied any recent travel or being bedbound but did mention that she's been less active since her mastectomy and spends most of the day sitting.  The case stands out because: This patient represents individuals with multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) including cancer (Breast Cancer)  chemotherapy treatment  advanced age  heightened BMI  diabetes  hypertension  and physical inactivity. Her mixture of signs  symptoms  and history are indicative of a potential thrombolytic event needing immediate intervention.  Purpose of the Case: This case would be helpful for medical students to understand the importance of an accurate and thorough patient history  recognize the multiple risk factors for DVT  learn about the potential complications of DVT like pulmonary embolism  and appreciate the importance of timely diagnosis and management of DVT. It also stresses on the importance of post-operative physical activity and patient compliance with medical advice.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,70,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: Mr. James Thompson  African-American  Age 62  Retired Military Personnel  from Birmingham  Alabama  Past Medical History: Hypertension for the past decade  controlled with antihypertensive medications. The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 5 years ago  managed by Metformin and diet control. He is a past smoker with a 20-pack year history  quit smoking two years at the insistence of his children. History of injury to his right leg during military service. No history of anticoagulant therapy or any predisposing genetic condition. No family history of DVT or any other blood clot issues.   Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson came to the outpatient department of the hospital complaining of significant discomfort in the right calf muscle for the past week. The pain  initially considered as a muscle strain due to daily walking exercise  increased gradually and was accompanied by noticeable swelling and warmth to touch. The patient stated the pain intensified on standing and subsided on elevating the leg. He denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or recent travel. He mentioned having weight gain over the past year despite efforts for diet control.  Prevalence Note: The specifics chosen for this case represent a realistic demographic affected by deep vein thrombosis. A higher prevalence has been observed among African-Americans and people over 60 have a significantly increased risk. Male prevalence is slightly higher than female. Obesity  history of leg injury  diabetes  etc.  are risk factors for developing DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,71,Case Report - Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Mrs. Fernandez  a 65-year-old Hispanic female.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Fernandez has a past known case of Rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. She has been on medication for the same  oral methotrexate (10mg weekly) for Rheumatoid arthritis and a combination of amlodipine (5mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg daily) for hypertension. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially.  Lately  the patient had a notable event in her life wherein she underwent a total hip replacement surgery for her Rheumatoid arthritis three weeks ago. During her postoperative time  she was under limited mobility and was on a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily) post-surgery for 14 days as per protocol.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Fernandez presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of swelling  warmth  and pain in her left lower limb  primarily in the calf area. The pain  as described by her  intensifies during walks and feels somewhat better in rest. Additionally  she reports feelings of faintness and shortness of breath which started to bother her more since yesterday.   She denies any recent trauma  prolonged travel  or family history of clotting disorders. However  she has been less active since her hip surgery  which she mentions may contribute to her current state due to immobilization. She has no known allergies. Upon physical examination  her vitals shows borderline tachycardia.  This case study is designed for medical students to understand the risk factors  clinical presentation  and possible consequences of deep vein thrombosis. Included in the studies should be proper diagnosis procedures and the understanding of the importance of DVT prophylaxis in high risk patients and early intervention to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism. Further highlighting the need for the same  literature suggests that the prevalence of DVT is greater in older adults  post-surgical patients especially orthopedic surgeries  and those with immobilization for prolonged periods. Also  it's significant to discuss that although DVT can occur in every race and ethnicity  there are some disparities with a slightly higher prevalence in Caucasians and African Americans as compared to Hispanics and Asian populations. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,72,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile  Name: Mrs. Jane Thompson Age: 65 years old Gender: Female Race: White Occupation: Retired school teacher  Background  Mrs. Thompson resides in an urban area. She lives alone since her husband passed away five years ago  but she has a supportive daughter who helps provide her daily care needs.  Past Medical History  Mrs. Thompson has hypertension and osteoarthritis for which she takes medication regularly. She was also diagnosed with obesity (BMI of 31). She's a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  and occasionally consumes alcohol. Mrs. Thompson's mother suffered from deep vein thrombosis.  Presenting Complaints  Mrs. Thompson visited the hospital with complaints of tenderness  warmth  redness  and swelling in the lower part of her left leg. She mentioned that she recently took a 6-hour flight to visit her son in a different state a week earlier and has been experiencing these symptoms since her return. Apart from this  she also noticed some shortness of breath which she initially thought was due to her weight issue.   Key Findings  In literature  it is found that DVT is more common amongst older adults  especially those above 60 years of age. Being overweight increases the risk of DVT  especially in women. Family history of venous thromboembolism  recent long travel  and lack of physical activity might also place a patient at higher risk for DVT.  Objective of Case Study  This case is designed to help medical students understand the risk factors and typical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and appreciate the assessment  diagnosis  and management principles for this condition. Through this case  students should develop a deeper understanding and competence in considering differential diagnoses  ordering appropriate investigations  recognizing potential complications  and developing a holistic management plan with prevention strategies for DVT.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,73,Case Scenario: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographics:   Mr. Robert  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  has come to the ER. The patient lives in rural Kentucky  married  with two adult children. He has a decent healthcare insurance as per his previous employment benefits.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Robert has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which have been well managed with medication (Metformin and Lisinopril respectively). He is also a former smoker (stopped 15 years ago) with a 20 pack year history. There are no known allergies to any specific medicine. Despite his chronic conditions  he leads an active lifestyle and exercises regularly.  Key Complaints:  The patient is suffering from significant right calf pain  which started few days ago. He reports the pain as a constant heavy and aching feeling along with noticeable swelling  warmth  and mild erythema. The pain is more severe on standing or walking. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath or any other localized pain. No recent trauma or injury has been experienced.  Mr. Robert has recently returned from a trip to Australia  during which he had prolonged periods (more than 10 hours at a time) of immobility during the flight. This was unusual for him as he leads an active lifestyle.   As per literature  DVT more commonly affects individuals aged above 60  especially if they are Caucasians  and those with chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Prolonged immobility due to travel or bed rest is a contributing risk factor.  The case of Mr. Robert is designed to be demographically representative  taking into account key risk factors (age  chronic conditions  immobility/travel  ex-smoker) that fit in line with common characteristics of patients with DVT as per current medical literature.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,74,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information: Mr. Jackson  a 66-year-old Caucasian male  retired factory worker.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Jackson presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden swelling and mild pain in his right lower leg. The pain has been intensifying over the course of 3 days. He mentions it feels “heavy ” and when asked to further clarify  he likens the sensation to a cramping or aching pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of smoking  which he quit 6 years ago. He has a diagnosis of Type II Diabetes which has been managed with Metformin for the past 10 years. He also has hypertension controlled with Lisinopril  and high cholesterol controlled with Atorvastatin. He reports no known allergies. Mr. Jackson had a cholecystectomy performed 8 years ago. He has no history of malignancies or blood clotting disorders.   Review of Systems: Mr. Jackson complains of shortness of breath with slight exertion  but no chest pain or cough. He denies any recent hospitalizations  prolonged immobilizations  trauma  or surgical interventions. No history of varicose veins. He does not report among his relationships anyone that has had blood clot complications. There are no significant findings upon cardiovascular  gastrointestinal  or neurological assessment.  Recent Significant Activity: Mr. Jackson recently went on a road trip with his wife  where he spent a considerable amount of time (approximately 10 hours a day for three consecutive days) sitting in a car with minimal breaks for movement.  The case aims at provoking thoughts regarding differential diagnosis based on the demographics  epidemiological factors  comprehensively assessing risk elements  managing a diagnosis  considering implications of patient's existing medical conditions on the current situation  discussing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions  and engaging in patient education for both the immediate concern and future prevention strategies.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,75,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 67 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Factory Worker Living Situation: Lives alone in a two-story house; his daughter visits weekly.  Past Medical History:  1. Patient had a partial colectomy one year ago for colorectal cancer; in remission now. 2. Patient has a 5-year history of hypertension  well managed on medication (Enalapril 10mg daily). 3. Patient smoked about a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years  quit smoking 10 years ago. 4. Patient is overweight with BMI of 29. 5. Patient doesn't drink alcohol and denies illicit drug use.  Chief Complaint:   The patient has been experiencing dull  aching pain in his left calf for three days. He noticed that the left calf appears slightly swollen  with skin warm and red over the area. There is no history of trauma or injury to the leg. The pain is worse when standing or walking and improves with rest and elevation.  Additional Information:  Upon further questioning  the patient reveals his physical activity has been limited recently due to bad winter weather  and he has been spending most of his time sitting or lying down. He also admits to adherence issues with his prescribed compression stockings  finding them uncomfortable to wear.  This scenario is designed to reflect the demographics most likely to experience Deep Vein Thrombosis  which is more common in older adults  those with previous surgery  sedentary lifestyle  tobacco use  and individuals with benign hypertension. The emphasis is on leg symptoms that aren't attributable to injury  to highlight the importance of understanding a patient's history and risk factors when interpreting symptoms.   Medical students should be able to identify the risk factors for DVT in this case (age  history of cancer  obesity  prolonged immobility  hypertension  and non-compliance to prophylaxis) and proceed to clinical examination  D-Dimer test  and/or Doppler ultrasounds appropriately. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,76,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: Gender: Female Age: 67 years old Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Living Condition: Lives alone in an urban setting; retired school teacher  Medical History: - Breast cancer diagnosed six years ago  treated successfully with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. - History of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer led to 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen) which was ceased a year ago. - Non-smoker and drinks alcohol moderately. - Chronic hypertension controlled with lifestyle modifications and medication. - No history of injury or surgery in the past two years. - No history of anticoagulant use or familial blood clotting disorders.  Presenting Complaints: - Unilateral  progressive and painful swelling in the right lower leg for the past three days. - Tenderness and redness along the path of superficial veins in the right lower extremity. - Mildly raised body temperature (low-grade fever). - Pain slightly relating to activity  increases with standing  and slightly eases with leg elevation. - Shortness of breath and chest pain for last 24 hours. - No recent travel  immobility  trauma or significant weight changes.  Upon these complaints  an Doppler ultrasound was ordered that confirmed deep vein thrombosis in her right lower leg. The chest pain and shortness of breath raised concern of a potential pulmonary embolism  thus a chest computed tomography was ordered.  This case presents a patient who belongs to one of the highest risk groups for DVT. Elderly age  a history of cancer and its treatment  and prolonged estrogen exposure due to hormone therapy are significant risk factors for DVT in this patient. This case will help medical students understand the correlation between these factors and the pathogenesis of DVT  guiding them to accurate diagnosis and treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,77,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Robert Johnson  African American male  aged 66  Past Medical History: Robert has been managing type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years  non-insulin dependent  and hypertension for the last 10 years. He had an appendicitis surgery 30 years ago. He has a history of smoking  with 1 pack per day for the last 40 years. He shows moderate compliance towards his daily medications; metformin 500mg BID for diabetes  and lisinopril 10mg QD for hypertension. He has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaints: Robert attended the walk-in clinic complaining of a swollen  red  warm  and tender to touch right lower limb extending from the calf to the thigh for the last four days. He also described intermittent shortness of breath over the last two days. On initial evaluation  his vitals were normal except for mild tachypnea. He denied history of recent trauma  surgery  prolonged immobilization  or family history of coagulopathies.  Notes for Training: This case is designed to represent the demographics predisposed to DVT namely  elderly  type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and history of smoking. The racial component (African American) is also included for the sake of demographic representation. The key complaints include common symptoms of DVT like swollen  red  and warm lower limb along with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary involvement (shortness of breath and tachypnea). This case seeks to encourage medical students to consider DVT and explore differential diagnosis such as cellulitis  superficial vein thrombosis  baker's cyst etc. Furthermore  the students will learn how to manage the condition involving anticoagulation therapy  addressing the risk factors  and the importance of patient education for medication compliance and lifestyle modifications.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,78,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics:  Identity: J.S.  Age: 67 years old  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired engineer   Past Medical History: J.S. has a past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with medication (Metformin for type 2 diabetes  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension). He is also an ex-smoker  with a 20 pack-year history  who quit a decade ago. He underwent a knee replacement surgery four months ago. His Body Mass Index (BMI) categorizes him as overweight (BMI: 28). Family history includes a brother who previously experienced pulmonary embolism.   Key Complaints: J.S. presents with a visibly swollen  painful  and red left leg. He has been experiencing increasing discomfort in his left calf over the past week  which has now compounded into acute pain. He denies experiencing any chest pain  breathing difficulties  rapid heartbeat  or coughing. However  he confesses to been sedentary over the last few weeks due to reduced mobility post-surgery and limited physical activities.  Case Discussion: This case represents a typical scenario for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) based on J.S's demographics  risk factors  and symptoms. According to literature  DVT has a higher incidence in elderly people  with the average age of patients being 60 years old. Caucasians are reportedly more at risk compared to other ethnicities. Risk factors include surgeries  cancer  immobility  previous history of DVT  familial susceptibility  and presence of other diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Overweight and smoking are lifestyle factors that increase the risk. The swollen  painful  lower extremity in this patient is suggestive of DVT. It is crucial to further investigate this patient for DVT and initiate prompt treatment if needed  bearing in mind his risk of developing complications such as pulmonary embolism. This case will be helpful in training medical students to identify the risk factors and diagnose DVT based on the clinical presentation and patient's history. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,79,Patient Information:  Subject: Caucasian Male Age: 65 Occupation: Retired office clerk Social History: Non-smoker  occasional drinker Home Situation: Lives alone   Past Medical History: - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Hypertension - Previous history of minor stroke two years ago  with complete recovery - Sedentary lifestyle - No known allergies  Presenting Complaints: The patient complains of: 1. Increasing swelling in the left lower leg over the past week. 2. Warmth over the swollen area. 3. Localized pain in the left lower leg. 4. Mild shortness of breath on exertion.  Recent History: The patient recently had a long-haul flight (8-hours) about ten days ago. Current medications include Metformin for Type-2 Diabetes and Amlodipine for Hypertension. He takes daily low-dose Aspirin following his minor stroke.  Note to Medical Educators: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) predominantly affects older adults and is more common in individuals with significant risk factors. This case represents demographic factors such as age  ethnicity  and includes risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  a history of vascular events  recent long-haul flight  and sedentary lifestyle which may contribute to the development of DVT. This case should guide students in recognizing the signs and symptoms of DVT while understanding the importance of considering the effect of risk factors in patient's presentations. This will also allow considerations on differential diagnosis  evaluations  and potential treatments related to this condition to be thoroughly explored.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,80,"Case Report: Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged Caucasian Male   Demographics: Patient's name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Military officer Location: Midwest  USA  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is a former smoker who quit about 20 years ago. He served in the military for 30 years of his life and is currently retired. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which are well-controlled with medication. He also suffered a right knee injury during his military service which required an orthopedic surgery 15 years ago. There is no notable family medical history of severe illnesses.  Key Complaints:  For 5 days  Mr. Doe has been persistently experiencing pain and swelling in his left leg  more specifically in his calf. He describes the pain as a """"pulling sensation"""" that is exacerbated by walking. He has also been feeling moderately short of breath upon exertion. He reports no chest pain or palpitations. However  he has noticed some changes in the skin color around his lower left leg  turning it a bit reddish-blue. Fever  trauma  recent surgeries  or prolonged bed rest are denied.  Given this information about Mr. Doe  a medical student/trainee should be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  while also considering the patient's age  past medical history  and current complaints. The connection between a history of orthopedic knee surgery and the possibility of DVT is a significant learning point. Other potential risk factors like prolonged immobilization  recent trauma  or coagulation abnormalities should always be considered. This case also provides an opportunity to discuss the possible complications of untreated DVT  like pulmonary embolism  as suggested by the complaint of shortness of breath.   Note: Even though DVT can occur to any individual  the chosen demographics are based on the fact that Caucasian people have been reported to have a higher risk of developing DVT than people of other races. Men are slightly more likely to suffer DVT than women. Also  the incidence increases with age  particularly after age 40."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,81,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Gender: Female Age: 62 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Residence: Urban area Smoking Status: Never smoked Alcohol: Drinks occasionally  Medical History:  The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed ten years ago  for which she is on long-term corticosteroid therapy. She is also hypertensive  controlled with medication for the past 5 years. She has no history of diabetes or any cardiovascular diseases. The patient has been on oral contraceptives for a prolonged period during her younger years. She has not undergone any surgical procedures recently  and her family history is unremarkable.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient reports progressive swelling of her left lower leg over the past week  accompanied by persistent discomfort. She described the pain as a dull ache that increases with movement. She also complained of mild shortness of breath on exertion and an onset of low-grade fever for two days. She denies any incidents of recent injury  trauma  or prolonged travel.  Note: This patient reflects the steep increase in deep vein thrombosis risk in post-menopausal Caucasian women  especially those with a history of long-term corticosteroid use  former oral contraceptive users  and individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. This case also highlights the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  pain  and mild exertional shortness of breath.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,82,Patient Information:  [Name: Mrs. Emily Patel] [Age: 62 years] [Sex: Female] [Race: South Asian] [Occupation: Retired school teacher] [Marital Status: Married with 4 children]  Medical History:  Mrs. Patel comes in with a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed well with medications (Levothyroxine and Atorvastatin  respectively). She had an uneventful knee replacement surgery 6 weeks ago. Mrs. Patel has been a non-smoker but has a past history of oral contraceptive use. There is no history of genetic conditions or blood disorders in the family.   Key Complaints:  Patient presents with fatigue  malaise  and a dull ache in her left leg that has been progressively worsening over the last week. The left calf appears marginally swollen  red and warm to touch compared to the right  but there is no obvious deformity or open wound. The pain tends to increase when she stands or walks and is relieved slightly by leg elevation. Mrs. Patel also reports mild breathlessness on exertion  and a recent flight travel of 4 hours about two weeks ago.  Educational Case Objectives:  1. Assess the risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and appreciate the importance of an accurate and detailed history. 2. Understand the presentation and clinical features of DVT. 3. Interpret diagnostic tests for DVT. 4. Discuss appropriate management and prevention strategies for DVT. 5. Counsel the patient on lifestyle modifications to prevent DVT recurrence.  Medical Note:  Though the highest-risk age group for DVT is 70 and above  a large longitudinal study of UK patients found the average age of DVT presentation to be 60 for women and 64 for men. Hence the choice of age. DVT is found to be prevalent among White and African American populations although presented here with South Asian demographics to acknowledge DVT as a global health problem. Risk factors including advanced age  recent surgery  prolonged immobility and hormonal contraceptive use are incorporated in order to address real-world scenarios.

Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,85,"Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: The patient  referred to as Mr. Simmons  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male of moderate income. He is a retired marine engineer living in an urban area with his wife.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Simmons has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He takes oral hypoglycemic agents and anti-hypertensives regularly. He has a 20-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally but has no known drug allergies. He is not on any regular exercise regimen and describes his diet as """"balanced."""" He has no family history of blood clotting disorders  heart diseases  or cancer. His father died of a stroke at 76  and his mother has well-managed osteoporosis at 85.  Key Complaints:   Mr. Simmons came to the clinic complaining of gradually increasing left leg pain and swelling for the last one week. He noticed his leg turned slightly red and warm recently. He describes the pain as a deep ache that gets worse when walking or standing. He also noted mild shortness of breath  particularly when climbing stairs  but initially attributed this to lack of exercise and old age. He denied chest pain  cough  hemoptysis or any recent trauma or injury to the leg. He hasn't undergone any recent surgical procedures or prolonged bed rest.  In the presented case  Mr. Simmons partially fits in the typical demographic profile for Deep Vein Thrombosis commonly seen in clinical settings  bearing the common risk factors like older age  obesity  lack of physical activity  and pre-existing conditions (hypertension and diabetes). Even though smoking is a significant risk factor  in this case  he quit smoking five years ago. While deep vein thrombosis can affect anyone  understanding key demographic trends is crucial in preparing medical students to recognize  diagnose and manage this complex condition.  (According to several published medical reports and studies  DVT commonly affects older adults  particularly those over 50. Obesity  a sedentary lifestyle  and conditions such as cancer  heart disease  and lung disease can also increase the risk of DVT. A history of smoking is also mentioned as a significant risk factor.)   *N.B: Patient Demographics are made up for the purposes of the educational case and bearing in mind access to healthcare factors. They do not intend to stereotype or bias towards any particular group.* "
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,86,Case Report:  Patient Profile  Name: Mr. Theodore Smith Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Location: Suburban Midwest   Medical history: Patient has a past history of type II diabetes which is managed with metformin. He was also diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension two years ago and has been on Losartan ever since. The patient had a total right hip arthroplasty four weeks ago. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and is a former smoker (20 pack-years).   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with complaints of gradual onset of swelling  redness and increasing warmth in the right leg  slightly above the knee and calf  over the past week. Additionally  the patient mentions a mild-moderate level of discomfort in the same region towards the end of the day. No signs of fever  chest pain  or breathlessness.   This case would then go on to clinical examination  diagnostic tests  and further management focusing on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). It covers the main risk factors for DVT namely elderly age  major surgery (hip arthroplasty)  immobility  diabetes  hypertension  and past history of smoking.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,87,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics: - Patient Name: Mr. Lewis Martin - Gender: Male - Age: 58 - Ethnicity: African-American - Occupation: Long-haul truck driver - Marital Status: Married - Current Residence: Charleston  South Carolina  Following the literature  DVT is more common among African-Americans  the elderly (over 60 years)  overweight individuals  and those with immobile jobs or lifestyles. Our creation of an African American  long-haul truck driver aged 58 will help accurately represent these high risk groups linked with DVT in the literature.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martin is obese (BMI 32) and has a history of hypertension controlled with medications. He also was treated for prostate cancer two years ago with no recurrence. He is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has a family history of genetic thrombophilic disorders  specifically his father had Factor V Leiden mutation causing a DVT once. He has no history of lung or heart diseases  and his cholesterol levels are within normal limits.  Key Complaints: Mr. Martin presented to the clinic with dull aching pain in his left calf which he initially ignored thinking it was due to driving for long hours. However  the pain progressively worsened over a week making it difficult for him to walk. He noticed that his left calf had become noticeably swollen  tender  and warm to touch. He also reported a feeling of heaviness in his leg and these symptoms were not relieved by over-the-counter meds. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  recent injuries  or traveling  but does report prolonged sitting due to his work demands.  In conclusion  the case of Mr. Martin should provide students with a challenging scenario of DVT. His risk factors - being overweight  prolonged periods of immobility due to his job  hypertension  and a family history of genetic thrombophilic disorders - make his case an ideal learning opportunity. These characteristics  combined with his specific symptoms  should encourage students to consider proper assessment  diagnosis  and subsequently  the appropriate treatment regimen.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,88,Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Profile  Full name: John Doe Age: 63 Years Old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer  Past Medical History: •	Ex-smoker for 10 years  30 pack-years •	Hypertension - controlled with Lisinopril 10mg daily •	Type II Diabetes - on Metformin 1000mg twice daily •	Thrombophilia •	Post-TKR (Total Knee Replacement) – right knee 5 days ago •	Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31 (Obesity)  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents to the outpatient clinic with pain and swelling in the right lower limb  more severe in the calf area. He describes the pain as a constant severe aching. He also noticed that his right leg appeared redder compared to the left  and felt warmer to touch. He denies any recent long journeys. He has no known allergies.  Examination: Upon examination  his right lower limb was swollen  erythematous  and warm to the touch  with calf circumference significantly larger compared to the left. His vital signs were within the normal range. His cardiovascular and respiratory examination showed no abnormalities. No superficial vein engorgement or ulcers were detected. The Homans sign was positive.  Assessment: The patient’s post-operative status  personal history of thrombophilia  sedentary lifestyle  and obesity are significant risk factors pointing towards DVT. The classic signs of pain  swelling  redness  and increased warmth reinforced the suspicion of DVT. Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb was immediately ordered.  Discussion Questions: 1.	What is the relevance of the patient’s past medical history to the case? 2.	What approach would you use in diagnosing DVT? 3.	What are the risk factors for DVT and how do they apply to our case? 4.	What is the standard treatment for DVT? 5.	What measures can the patient take to reduce the risk of future DVT episodes? 6.	How would you monitor and ensure the effectiveness of the treatment administered?  This case encourages medical students to take a holistic view of the patient's history and symptoms in formulating a plan for investigation and management of probable DVT. It demonstrates the relevance of exploring lifestyle factors  genetics  and previous medical history in diagnosing and managing clinical conditions.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,89,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics  Name: Mrs. Rachel Martinez Age: 65 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired public school teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Past Medical History  Mrs. Martinez is a nonsmoker but has a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes  both well-controlled with medication. She has had no prior surgeries or hospitalizations  has no allergies  and reports occasional alcohol consumption. Mrs. Martinez's mother died at a relatively early age from a heart attack. Her father had a stroke in his late 70s. Apart from these  there is no other significant family history.  Key Complaints  Mrs. Martinez came to the emergency room complaining of sudden and severe pain and swelling in her left calf that started 3 days ago. The pain increased while walking and was accompanied by a mild fever. She also has intermittent chest discomfort with shortness of breath. On further inquiry  she reports that she recently had a long-haul flight two weeks ago  after which she remained largely sedentary at home due to jet lag.  Conclusion  Given Mrs. Martinez's recent long-haul flight  followed by a fairly sedentary lifestyle afterwards  as well as her presenting symptoms  these cues should be alarming for conditions like DVT. On top of that  her age  hypertension  and diabetes are acknowledged risk factors associated with DVT. Consequently  medical students should be guided to corroborate these hints and guide the patient down a diagnostic pathway for DVT  which may include an ultrasound of her lower limbs or D-dimer test  among other potential steps. It is crucial for them to understand that quick identification and treatment of DVT can potentially prevent a life-threatening pulmonary embolism.   According to research  DVT is common in older adults (>55) with a higher risk in individuals with previous history of venous thromboembolism and certain genetic conditions. Her ethnicity (Hispanic) carries a lower risk compared to Caucasians; nevertheless  the existence of additional risk factors like obesity  prolonged immobility  and others like cancer and trauma should always be considered during the diagnostic process.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,90,Patient Case: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  In this case  we have a 65-year-old Caucasian male named John who is a retired school teacher.  Demographics: Gender: Male Age: 65 years  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired (Former School Teacher) Marital Status: Married Residence: Suburban area in North Carolina Insurance: Medicare Language: English Primary  understands a little Spanish  Past Medical History: He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago  which has been managed with Metformin and lifestyle changes. He underwent a total right knee arthroplasty three weeks ago due to severe osteoarthritis. He's a former smoker  who quit 20 years ago  and he drinks alcohol socially. He's physically active with daily morning walks and regularly practicing yoga. His BMI is slightly above normal- 26. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases: his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 67 and his older brother underwent angioplasty at 60 years old. John doesn't have any past history of hypertensive or ischemic heart disease.  Key Complaints: Today  he presents to the emergency department with his wife  complaining of progressive swelling in the right leg  which began around 18 hours ago and increased gradually. He denies any trauma but admits to having spent most of his time in bed since returning home post-operation. He also complains about mild to moderate pain in his right calf  rating it as an 8 on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). He is anxious  as his right calf seems warmer  with a dull aching pain. He mentions that his leg seems slightly reddish and is harder than usual.  This is a typical scenario in which deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can manifest  following orthopedic surgery in an elderly individual with risk factors including Diabetes Mellitus and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. It emphasizes the importance of probing into a patient's medical history and lifestyle habits during diagnosis. It also highlights the need for educating patients about the signs and symptoms of DVT following orthopedic surgery.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,91,Case Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged African American Female  Patient Demographics: Patient initials: N.D  Age: 50 years old  Sex: Female  Race: African American  Occupation: Office job (long hours of sitting)  Weight: 90 kg  Height: 170 cm  Past Medical History:  -N.D. has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed by diet  exercise  and Metformin. -Family history of cardiovascular diseases  including deep vein thrombosis. -Previous episode of DVT in her early 40s.  Key Complaints:  -N.D. has presented with complaints of swelling in her left leg that she has been noticing for about a week.  -She describes an area in her left calf that's warm to touch  red  and tender. - She complained about some mobility issues due to intense pain and discomfort  i.e.  difficulty in walking. -She also reported mild shortness of breath over the past two days. -N.D. also mentioned her concern about recent long hours at work where she sits for more than 6-7 hours at a time with minimal movement.  Please Note: In the literature  research shows the high prevalence of DVT in middle-aged  slightly overweight African Americans  and those with a family history of cardiovascular diseases. It’s not unusual for individuals with sedentary jobs or lifestyles  diabetes  or previous history to develop DVT. Hence  this case tailored for these key considerations.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,92,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. He is a non-smoker  and he has a desk job as an accountant which requires prolonged periods of sitting. He weighs 265 lbs and is 5’8” tall  which represents a BMI of 40.3 and qualifies as obese. He is a frequent traveler and recently returned from a long transatlantic flight.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  managed with lisinopril. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  controlled with metformin. He has no history of cardiovascular diseases  surgeries  or traumas. The patient's family history reveals a sister who had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis after a surgery two years ago.  Current Prescriptions: The patient is on long-term medication of lisinopril (10mg daily) and metformin (500mg twice daily).  Chief Complaint: The patient complains of a swollen right lower limb that has persisted for the past week. He has also started feeling occasional calf pain that increases with standing for extended periods or walking. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the limb. He also denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  This case represents the common risk factors associated with DVT including age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  long-haul travel  and family history of DVT. The prominence of DVT in white individuals and males is also mirrored in this patient's demographics. Keep in mind that this context is paramount in discerning DVT from other differential diagnoses.   Note: Before proceeding with examinations or procedures  make sure to provide students with relevant literature on DVT. Encourage them to consider the entire clinical picture: patient history  risk factors  physical examination  diagnostic testing  and potential complications. This will aid in their comprehensive understanding of the diagnosis  management  and prevention of deep vein thrombosis.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,93,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:   Mr. Rogers is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired from a desk job and lives with his wife in Seattle. He has led a fairly sedentary lifestyle in recent years due to his job and enjoys recreational activities like reading and cooking.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Rogers is a former smoker  having quit smoking about 20 years ago. He has a 10-year history of well-controlled Type 2 Diabetes that he manages with metformin and maintains a healthy diet. Furthermore  he has a history of hypertension  for which he takes a daily dose of atenolol. He has also been diagnosed with obesity  with a BMI of 31. However  there are no prior incidences of deep vein thrombosis  any pulmonary disorders  or recent surgeries.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Rogers reported swelling  warmth  redness  and tenderness in his left lower leg after he returned from a long-haul flight one week ago and noticed the symptoms have been steadily worsening. He had discomfort in his left calf during ambulation  but no definite pain. He reported feeling more fatigued than normal but didn't have any breathlessness  cough  or chest pain. He also denied any recent fevers  chills  or other systemic symptoms.  In literature  deep vein thrombosis is most common in individuals over the age of 60 and presents with risk factors like obesity  prolonged immobilization (such as long-haul flights)  and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. This case of Mr. Rogers accurately represents such demographics and risk factors associated with DVT  to provide medical students with a perfect training scenario.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,94,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 years old  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for 10 years  managed by medication (Lisinopril 10mg/day). 2. Type 2 Diabetes for 8 years  regulated with Metformin 500mg twice daily. 3. History of smoking 1 pack/day for 30 years  quit smoking 10 years ago. 4. Had a right hip replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. 5. No known history of coagulation disorders  no prior episodes of venous thromboembolism.  Presenting Complaints:   1. Unilateral swelling  redness  warmth  and pain in the right calf that started abruptly. 2. Slight fever and general feeling of being unwell. 3. The right calf appears larger than the left one.  Note: The patient demographics and case mimic the common risk factors and clinical presentation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Literature suggests advanced age (over 60)  obesity  previous major surgery  chronic conditions (like hypertension and diabetes)  extended periods of immobility and smoking history all increase the risk of DVT. The history of hip replacement surgery  in particular  further enhances the risk due to prolonged immobility post-surgery.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,95,Case Report: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information:  - Age: 66 years old - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive  severe pain and swelling in her left lower leg. The pain  initially described as mild and consistent  had become sharp and intensified. She did not report any accidents  arduous activities  or known injuries that precipitated this.  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension managed for the last ten years with Lisinopril. - Estrogen Replacement Therapy for post-menopausal symptoms for five years. - Episodes of varicose veins treated conservatively. - Two pregnancies without complications. - Former smoker who quit six years ago. - BMI of 33. However  no documented history of diabetes or dyslipidemia. - Her mother experienced an unprovoked Deep Vein Thrombosis in her late 60s.  The patient led a physically inactive lifestyle since her retirement two years ago  and her nutritional habits are lacking dietary fiber and high in cholesterol. In her profession as a school teacher  she had prolonged periods of standing  and her family history includes a mother who suffered a DVT. Although she has tried lifestyle modifications  control of her hypertension has been suboptimal. She denies any history of cancer or recent surgical procedures. Her only travel history is a six-hour flight about three months ago. She has no history of alcohol or any illicit drug use.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,96,Title: Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Patient Profile: Patient Initials: M.S. Age: 68 years  Sex: Gender Male Ethnicity: African American  Occupation: Retired Factory Worker  Past Medical History: M.S. has a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Additionally  he is a former smoker  having quit 8 years ago after a 35-year pack-a-day history. He also has moderate obesity with a BMI of 32 and was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. M.S. was hospitalized for a right hip arthroplasty two weeks ago and has been mostly bed-bound since the surgery. His medications include metformin  statins  and antihypertensive drugs.  Chief Complaints: Upon a follow-up visit to the hospital  M.S.  presents with acute onset of unilateral  progressively worsening pain and swelling in his right leg  predominantly around the calf region. The patient reports his pain as 7/10 on the pain scale  stating it increases with walking or standing. He denies any recent trauma  fever  or chest symptoms. No signs of superficial vein thrombosis  skin colour changes  or leg ulcers are noted.  In this case  the demographics of the patient reflect the epidemiology noted in studies. Older age  post-surgical state  obesity  and prolonged immobility coupled with conditions like diabetes and hypertension augment the risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Gender-wise  studies indicate a slightly higher prevalence of DVT in men. Ethnically  African Americans have notably higher rates of venous thromboembolism. Through such a case  the trainee/student is expected to engage with the diagnostic and management strategies for DVT considering the patient history and risk factors.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,97,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mrs. Martha Gomez  a 67-year-old African American female  resident of Tennessee.  Patient Background: Mrs. Gomez is a retired school teacher  living with her husband. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. Her BMI is 28 and she leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle due to her arthritis. Her diet lacks in proper fiber content and is high in saturated fats.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Gomez was diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes 12 years ago and osteoarthritis 5 years ago. She also has a family history of heart diseases; her father passed away due to myocardial infarction and her elder brother has been diagnosed with angina pectoris.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Gomez came into ER with her main complaints as sudden swelling in her left leg  redness  warmth  and tenderness localized to the calf area. In addition  she has been experiencing general fatigue and an unusual shortness of breath on exertion over the past week. Upon enquiring  she also mentioned that she recently had a long-haul flight (over 4 hours) a week ago  post which she noticed initial tenderness in her left calf.  Given the patient's age  past medical history including prolonged diabetes (known to affect blood vessels)  sedentary lifestyle furthering chances of stasis  family history of cardiac issues  recent long-haul flight promoting immobility  and the sudden presentation with symptoms  it is crucial to consider the possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Mrs. Gomez and proceed accordingly with her examination and investigations. An early and accurate diagnosis can significantly reduce complications such as the post-thrombotic syndrome and life-threatening pulmonary embolism.   Note: The above case presents the demographics as observed in the literature. The African American race is slightly more prone to DVT than other races. The female gender  although generally at less risk than males  can show increased DVT risk after menopause as seen in Mrs. Gomez's case. The professions involving sedentary lifestyle (such as her teaching job) also add to DVT risk. The age group above 60 gives a higher incidence of DVT due to various risk factors including immobilization  comorbid conditions  and decreased venous return. The case also takes into account common risk factors including diabetes  obesity (BMI>25)  and prolonged immobility due to long-haul flights.
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,98,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Ruth Taylor Age: 62 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired schoolteacher Location: Suburban  North Carolina  USA  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 6 years ago  on medication (Lisinopril 10mg  daily). 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 11 years ago  managed with oral medication (Metformin 1000mg  twice daily). 3. Previous Distal DVT: 4 years ago  treated with anticoagulant therapy (Warfarin). 4. Hypothyroidism: Diagnosed 8 years ago  controlled with levothyroxine (75 micrograms  daily). 5. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol (1-2 glasses of wine per month). 6. Family history of DVT and pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. Taylor presented at the emergency department complaining of a sudden swelling  redness  warmth  and pain in her left calf which began 48 hours ago. She denies any recent injury  long-distance travel  or periods of prolonged immobility. The pain seemed to worsen when she flexed her foot or stood for extended periods. She additionally mentioned a slight shortness of breath when performing minor household chores  which was unusual for her.    NOTE: This case focuses on deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common but serious medical condition. The choice of a patient in her sixties reflects statistics indicating that DVT is most common in adults over 60. The patient's history of hypertension  diabetes  and previous DVT should prompt medical students to consider her high risk  and her recent symptoms are suggestive of a potential DVT recurrence. Furthermore  her slight shortness of breath could indicate a possible pulmonary embolism  a common and serious complication of DVT. The scenario allows medical educators to discuss the evaluation  diagnosis  and management of DVT. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,99,Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Details:  Name: Mr. Louis Warren Age: 68 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired businessman  Chief Complaint: Mr. Warren presents with worsening pain in his right lower leg  which he describes as a deep  aching sensation. He also notes some swelling and redness  but denies fevers  chest pain or shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mr. Warren has a significant past medical history of type II diabetes and hypertension  managed with metformin and amlodipine respectively. In addition  he has a history of chronic arthritis managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and occasional steroid injections. He lacks any record of previous clot or bleeding disorders and is not on anticoagulants. He's a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago and has a moderate alcohol intake.  Recent events: 2 weeks ago  Mr. Warren had a total knee replacement surgery on his right leg for severe osteoarthritis. His post-operative period was complicated by a urinary tract infection for which he was treated with antibiotics.  His mobility was impaired due to prolonged bed rest during his recovery period.  Family history: His father passed away due to a heart attack and his mother had a stroke.  Context: Caucasian people  particularly those over 60 and with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension  face a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT occurrence further becomes more significant following major orthopedic surgeries such as total knee or hip replacements  largely due to immobilization periods. It is important for all medical students to understand the demographic risk factors  history cues and presenting symptoms of DVT in order to initiate swift management procedures to prevent further complications such as a pulmonary embolism. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis,10,100,Patient Profile:  Patient Name: Mr. Thomas Jefferson Age: 55 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Long haul truck driver Residence: Portland  Oregon  USA Marital Status: Married Social History: Former smoker  quit 5 years ago; occasional alcohol consumption  Past Medical History:   Mr. Jefferson has a history of hypertension  which he has been managing with medication (amlodipine 5mg daily) for the past three years. He hasn't been diagnosed with any other chronic disorders. He has been generally fit with an active lifestyle until recent changes in his work arrangements.  He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Jefferson presented with a complaint of increasing and persistent pain in his right lower leg  especially in the calf region. He described it as a “deep-seated soreness” that worsened over 5 days. There was associated mild swelling and redness as well. His recent job requires him to drive long distances without many breaks  which has been a significant change as compared to his previous more active daily routines.  He also reports a recent unexplained weight loss and a decreased appetite over the past two months.  The persisting pain  redness  and swelling point towards possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The associated unexplained weight loss and appetite changes raise concerns about possible malignancy leading to a hypercoagulable state resulting in DVT.  While this case focuses on a Caucasian male (they are more likely to suffer from DVT as per the literature)  it's important to note that deep vein thrombosis can affect people across all ages  races  and genders. This case represents a commonly seen demographic  but medical students should understand that DVT doesn't discriminate and can present in any patient demographic.
