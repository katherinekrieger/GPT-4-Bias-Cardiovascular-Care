Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,1,Title: A Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. X. Mr. X presented with a three-week history of unexplained fever  malaise  appetite loss  and significant weight loss. He works as a construction builder and lives with his wife in an urban residential area. He is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and denies any history of intravenous drug usage.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a known history of mitral valve prolapse diagnosed six years ago. He has been dealing lately with dental issues  having had substantial dental work done about a month ago. He also has a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes mellitus  which has been managed by oral hypoglycemic agents for the last eight years. Besides  he suffers from hypertension  under control with medication. He has no history of allergies.   Epidemiological studies show that his demographic  particularly being a Caucasian male approaching his sixties  puts him at a higher risk. The presence of a pre-existing cardiac condition like mitral valve prolapse adds to the increased risk. Notably  having attended dental procedures could potentially have opened a gateway for bacterial entry and the subsequent infection  triggering infective endocarditis.   Diagnosis:  During physical examination  Osler nodes are noted on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on palms and soles  signal potential infective endocarditis. These symptoms  combined with his persistent low-grade fever and the results of his blood culture tests  confirm the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Summary:  Mr. X's case underlines the risk factors that align with the demographic and medical history usually associated with native-valve infective endocarditis. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the roles of age  pre-existing cardiac abnormalities  and exposure to invasive dental procedures in the disease's occurrence and progression. Hence  a patient's demographic and medical history play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing infective endocarditis.   References:   Baddour  L. M.  Wilson  W. R.  Bayer  A. S.  Fowler  V. G.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,2,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Introduction: Our patient is Mr. R.S  a 62-year-old Caucasian male belonging to a low socio-economic background. He is a retired factory worker who has been living in rural Michigan. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 40 years and has a history of alcohol abuse  although he quit drinking three years ago.  Medical History: Mr. R.S has a long-standing history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes (for approximately 15 years) and was admitted to the hospital 8 months ago for diabetic complications. He also suffers from hypertension but has never been on medication. Furthermore  he had been diagnosed with Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in his early childhood but was never regularly treated.   Other significant developments include a series of dental procedures that he underwent around six months ago  without any antimicrobial prophylaxis which could have increased his risk of developing infective endocarditis.   Clinical Presentation: Over the past 2 weeks  Mr. R.S has been experiencing persistent  low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  chills  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. He also complains of dyspnea on exertion and chronic cough. He has reported bouts of confusion and some difficulty with concentration and memory. Also  there are few petechial hemorrhages in his palms and soles  along with a new murmur noted on auscultation. These symptoms suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Conclusion: Mr. R.S’s long history with RHD  poor oral health  and inadequate healthcare access due to socioeconomic factors  makes him a typical case for native-valve infective endocarditis. His uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  along with a history of smoking and alcohol abuse  add to his susceptibility and may complicate his prognosis. We recommend immediate diagnostic evaluation for this patient  including blood cultures and cardiovascular imaging.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,3,Title: Presentation of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient  Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of rheumatic heart disease and type II diabetes mellitus. He is a retired engineer  is married  and currently lives with his wife in their suburban home in New York. He is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his 40s and has been under routine cardiac surveillance since his diagnosis. He has type II diabetes mellitus which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. There is no known history of illicit drug use  dental procedures  or invasive procedures.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presents to the hospital with a two-week history of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  and new-onset heart murmur  which is more pronounced during systole. He also mentioned episodes of night sweats but denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or orthopnea. He is visibly sick-looking  jaundiced  and has multiple splinter hemorrhages in his nail beds. His spouse reported that his condition has progressively worsened  pushing them to seek medical assistance.  Demographic Considerations: Epidemiological studies show that infective endocarditis  particularly native valve endocarditis  is predominant in older male patients (>65 years old) with a history of degenerative valve disease  and implanted heart valves or rheumatic heart disease. Caucasian individuals are also prone.  Conclusion: Given this patient's profile and the presenting symptoms  Mr. Johnson is a typical representative of a patient with native valve infective endocarditis. This aligns well with the epidemiological data concerning the demographics most affected by this condition. His past medical history and presenting clinical features satisfy the modified Duke Criteria  which guides the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,4,Subject: Presentation - Native-valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Introduction:  Today  we will be discussing the case study of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart's chamber and its native valves caused by bacteria or fungi. Persons above 60 years of age are most often affected  making our patient's demographic a typical presentation.  Demographics:  Let's break down the demographics:  - Gender: Male  - Age: 65 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian   This demographic is statistically the most represented in cases of native valve infective endocarditis according to research. However  it's imperative to understand that this does not exclude other demographics from this disease condition.  Past Medical History:  Diving into the patient’s past medical history  we find he has been suffering from:  - Chronic rheumatoid arthritis for the past 15 years. - Prescribed medications include methotrexate and occasional use of corticosteroids. - Documented case of periodontal disease and has lost several teeth over the years.  - Mild hypertension  controlled with lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. - Patient has no known allergies.  These medical histories play a critical role in his present condition. Rheumatoid arthritis  especially on methotrexate  can lead to a compromised immune system  increasing the risk for infection. His untreated periodontal disease also significantly raises the likelihood of bacteremia  initiating native valve endocarditis. Also  the patient's hypertension may have contributed to the heart's structural problems  again  predisposing to endocarditis.  In Conclusion:  This presentation gives us an insight into the demographic and risk profile of a typical patient affected by native-valve infective endocarditis. However  it's important to appreciate the wide presentation variability and to remain vigilant in picking up subtle indicators in individuals across all age groups and backgrounds. With endocarditis  early detection is crucial  and a detailed medical history often provides critical clues.   In our next discussion  we will delve more into the diagnostic measures  treatment options and preventive measures for native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,5,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of polysubstance abuse (including IV drug use) presents to the emergency department of our hospital. Mr. Smith is a homeless individual  frequently living in shelters. He is a smoker and also has a history of high alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: On reviewing his past medical history  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Hepatitis C  probably due to his IV drug use. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. The patient was not under any regular medications or medical follow-up.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith has been unwell for two weeks  suffering from high fever  chills  and a persistent dry cough. He has reported night sweats  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss. He also stated experiencing increasing fatigue and weakness. Upon physical examination  he presented with a new heart murmur and fingertip lesions - otherwise known as Osler's nodes.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient's symptoms and his lifestyle risk factors  a provisional diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered.   Infective endocarditis predominantly occurs in older adults  with the highest incidence in those aged between 60-69 years  thus fitting in with Mr. Smith's demographic profile. With his history of intravenous drug use and Hepatitis C infection  he carries additional risk factors. Co-existing conditions such as COPD and hypertension may also contribute to his susceptibility to this condition.  Plan: The suspected diagnosis will need to be confirmed through blood cultures and an echocardiogram. If the results are positive  prolonged antibiotic therapy  and possibly valve surgery will likely be needed for treatment.   To manage Mr. Smith's case optimally  a multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease specialists  cardiologists  and cardiac surgeons is essential. Furthermore  it is imperative to address the underlying risk factors  such as substance abuse  and lack of stable housing  for an effective long-term treatment strategy. Public health and social workers would play a crucial role in this aspect. Given the complexity and potential severity of Mr. Smith's condition  close monitoring and follow-up will be paramount for his recovery.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,6,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Presentation  Slide 1:  • Patient Overview:  Mr. Johnson is a 56-year-old white male who is currently a resident in the north western region of the USA.   Slide 2: • Social History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of moderate daily alcohol use and previously engaged in intravenous drug use  although he now reports 10 years of abstinence. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. Mr. Johnson was formally employed as a construction worker but currently works as a courier.  Slide 3: • Medical History:  Our patient has a prior history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure three years ago and has been on medication. Unfortunately  Mr. Johnson has obstructive sleep apnea as well but he is inconsistent with using his CPAP machine. He reports no known allergies  but has a family history of heart diseases.  Slide 4:  • Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Johnson presents with a recent onset of fatigue  fever  chills  loss of appetite and weight loss over the past week. In addition  he has also been experiencing night sweats and malaise. He reports new onset of shortness of breath on mild exertion which was not present before.  Slide 5:  • Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Johnson appears fatigued. Oral examination shows evidence of poor dental hygiene. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new murmur on auscultation  consistent with regurgitant flow. He has also developed petechiae on his lower extremities  and his body temperature was recorded at 38.2°C.  Slide 6:  • Likely Diagnosis: Given the constellation of his symptoms and signs  physical findings and his previous medical history  our working diagnosis is Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.   Slide 7: • Next Steps: We would like to proceed with blood cultures  CBC  ESR  CRP  ECG  chest X-ray  and finally an Echocardiogram to confirm our suspicion and proceed with treatment accordingly. Antibiotic therapy will likely be initiated immediately based on the strong clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis.   Slide 8:  • Conclusion and Future Implications: Mr. Johnson’s condition  if promptly and adequately treated  will lead to a significant improvement in his quality of life. However  identifying and managing risk factors such as poor oral hygiene and managing his other comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension will be essential in preventing recurrent episodes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,7,Patient Presentation:  We present the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian male presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient is originally from a suburban region  unemployed and a former smoker. He resides with his wife and they have two adult children. He has a history of social alcohol use but denies any current or past illicit drug use.  From a medical perspective  the patient has a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic kidney disease (stage III). He was also diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has not reported any previous episodes of infective endocarditis or any other heart diseases. His surgical history is unremarkable. The family history is significant for ischemic heart disease with his father having experienced a heart attack at the age of 66.   In terms of symptoms  the patient reported a three-week duration of fatigue and unintended weight loss  with more recent onset of intermittent fever combined with chilling sensation. His wife mentioned they both noted that his skin color looked slightly pale these days. He has also had a poor appetite and complained about occasional nausea. He denied chest pain  cough  shortness of breath  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Infective endocarditis literature reports that it mostly affects male patients  generally ages 30-60  with a higher incidence in Caucasians. Incidence increases in those with pre-existing cardiac conditions  but there is also a substantial association with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease  two conditions present in our patient's medical history. Additionally  common signs include fever  fatigue  weight loss and nausea  which were all reported by our patient.  To sum it up  based on his clinical features and risk factors  including age  sex  diabetes mellitus  chronic kidney disease  and hypertension  the patient has been recognized as a possible case of native-valve infective endocarditis and is currently under active investigation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,8,Title: Clinical Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  office worker  non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumer  has presented to the clinic complaining of fatigue  loss of appetite  weight loss  night sweats  and intermittent fever over the past three weeks. These are the classical non-specific symptoms of infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a complicated medical history that includes stable ischemic heart disease and heart valve disease for over ten years. He has specifically been diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation and has been on medication accordingly. In addition  he suffers from well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which could predispose him to infections. No known allergies. Last dental visit was six months ago  and no surgical or invasive procedures were reported within the last year.  Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears chronically ill and weak. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 130/85mmHg  heart rate of 95bpm  and a low-grade fever of 38°C (100.4°F). Cardiac examination reveals a new-onset heart murmur  indicative of possible valve dysfunction.   Other Clinical Findings: On further evaluation  the patient exhibits findings suggestive of infective endocarditis  including Osler nodes (painful red nodules on the pads of the fingers and toes) and Janeway lesions (painless red lesions on the palms and soles). Blood tests showed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and moderate normocytic anaemia. Three sets of blood cultures have been sent for investigation.    In the context of his past medical and present history  and based on his physical and preliminary laboratory findings  Mr. Doe is highly suspected of having native-valve infective endocarditis  likely related to his underlying heart valve disease. Further confirmatory tests  including echocardiogram and blood culture  are needed for definitive diagnosis and guiding the treatment strategy.  Please note that endocarditis predominantly affects males  with the majority of the cases being Caucasian  over 50  with underlying heart conditions. It is also important to mention that diabetes is ranked among the top comorbidities related to endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,9,Title: A Case Presentation of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile:   Mr. Johnson  a 60-year-old African American male with a history of intravenous drug use  presents with generalized fatigue  weight loss  fever  and a heart murmur consistent with regurgitation. He has lived in an urban setting within the United States for his entire life and is currently unemployed. He has a past medical history significant for chronic Hepatitis C infection  untreated due to financial constraints  and recurrent bacterial infections suspected to be a result of his drug use behavior. Furthermore  he is a current smoker  has a history of alcohol abuse  and has previously been homeless.   Clinical Presentation:   Mr. Johnson has noted an unintentional loss of 15 pounds over the past six weeks. He has felt generalized weakness accompanied by night sweats and recurrent fevers. On further investigation  he was found to have Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles.  Diagnostic Investigation:  A physical examination revealed conjunctival petechiae and a new systolic murmur that was more significant at the mitral area. His temperature was recorded at 38.5°C. Blood cultures were taken and an echocardiogram ordered. Echocardiography confirmed the presence of vegetations on his mitral valve  indicative of endocarditis. Additionally  his blood cultures became positive for Staphylococcus aureus  one of the most common organisms associated with endocarditis in intravenous drug users. His hemoglobin were at lower limit of normal  suggesting a chronic disease or malnutrition  and his ESR was elevated.  Infective Endocarditis:  Mr. Johnson's symptoms  examination findings  and diagnostic results are all suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE). Based on his history of IV drug use and blood culture  this is most probably a case of right-sided native valve infective endocarditis. Following the diagnosis  Mr. Johnson was started on empiric antibiotic therapy for IE  and his cardiovascular status was closely monitored by the cardiology department.   Summary:   This case exemplifies the demographic groups most commonly affected by native-valve infective endocarditis  namely aging populations  ethnic minorities  intravenous drug users  and those with pre-existing hepatitis C infection. Furthermore  the manifestation of IE in this case brings to light the importance of a comprehensive patient history  thorough physical examination  and confirming diagnosis through appropriate investigative processes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,10,Patient Presentation:   I would like to present the case of a 60-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson  who comes in with a chief complaint of intermittent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss over the last few weeks.  Demographics:   Mr. Johnson was born and raised in urban New Jersey  and has spent his adult life working as an automotive mechanic  a job that puts him in close contact with dirt  grease  and possibly harmful bacteria. He is married and has two adult children. He is a lifetime non-smoker and a social drinker  typically consuming about two drinks per weekend.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has been managing type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years through diet  lifestyle changes  and with metformin. Other significant medical history includes hypertension  managed with a thiazide diuretic  and hyperlipidemia for which he takes statins. There is no known history of drug abuse or IV drug use. He had a knee replacement 10 years ago due to osteoarthritis. No past history of cardiac disease  rheumatic fever  or valvular disease.  Current Complaint:   He has been experiencing intermittent fever with chills and night sweats for six weeks. Over the same period  he reports unexplained weight loss of about 10 pounds. The patient has felt increasingly weak  tired  and experienced occasional breathlessness with exertion. He also reports a new heart murmur noticed by his primary care physician.  Suspicion:   Based on these symptoms  there is a high suspicion of infective endocarditis. The fact that Mr. Johnson does not have a known history of cardiac disease  with no previous valvular defects or abnormalities  this case would likely be classified as native-valve infective endocarditis.  Plan:   Further testing will include blood cultures  Echocardiogram (both Transthoracic Echocardiogram and Transesophageal Echocardiogram). If infectious endocarditis is confirmed  the patient will receive an individualized treatment regimen based on the causative microorganism identified in blood cultures.   Demographic Representation:   The demographic representation of Mr. Johnson  including his racial background and age  is consistent with the reported epidemiology of infective endocarditis  specifically native-valve. According to the literature  infective endocarditis is more prevalent among males  and the incidence increases with age  with a peak incidence between the ages of 50 and 70 years. There is also a reported relatively higher risk among African American men  as compared to their Caucasian counterparts.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,11,Patient Presentation  Our patient is Mr. Garcia  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  with a past medical history of Rheumatic heart disease. Mr. Garcia resides in an urban setting  and generally has a low to moderate socioeconomic status  characteristic of the typical patient demographic presenting with infective endocarditis. He is currently under treatment for hypertension and has been a smoker for the last 20 years  contributing further to his cardiovascular risk. He does not have any history of IV drug use or alcohol abuse.  Mr. Garcia presented to our department with a one-month history of intermittent fever  previously treated outside as a case of typhoid fever with oral antibiotics. He has been feeling generally unwell  with fatigue  loss of appetite and has noticed weight loss over the last month. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath on exertion.  On examination  his vitals were temperature 38.5°C  blood pressure 140/85 mm Hg  pulse rate 96 bpm  and respiratory rate 16 per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed an early diastolic murmur along the left lower sternal border. An ocular examination showed Roth spots. These clinical signs suggest a case of native valve infective endocarditis. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable.     Given Mr. Garcia's past history of rheumatic heart disease  along with his clinical presentation and examination findings  the preliminary diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis most likely affecting the aortic valve. Further investigation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  has been suggested for confirmation of the diagnosis. His treatment plan will be formulated based on the results of these investigations. Emergency surgery is seldom necessary  medical management is the first line of treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,12,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: A Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Presented by: [Your Name]  Slide 2: Demographic Information & Past Medical History  - Our patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male named Tom - Occupation: Construction Worker - Social History: Tom is a non-smoker and occasional alcohol drinker. No history of illicit drug use. - Family History: Father had coronary artery disease - Past Medical History: Tom was diagnosed with diabetes type 2  five years ago  which is currently being managed with oral antidiabetic medication. He had dental surgery around three weeks ago.  Slide 3: Current Presentation  - Tom presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of fever  malaise  and fatigue. - Also reports experiencing night sweats and unintentional weight loss over the past two weeks  Slide 4: Physical Examination  - Observation: Appears ill  dusky complementary coloration  underweight - Cardiovascular Exam: A new heart murmur was detected  suggestive of mitral regurgitation. - Skin Exam: Multiple red tender subcutaneous nodules were observed on his palms and soles.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  - Blood tests: High erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and leukocyte count indicating systemic infection - Blood cultures: Positive for Staphylococcus aureus - Echocardiogram: Vegetations observed on the mitral valve  Slide 6: Conclusion – Diagnosis & Management  Tom has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  likely secondary to his recent dental procedure and precipitated by his underlying diabetes. Management would include prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment alongside regular monitoring of his cardiac function.  Slide 7: End  Thank you for your attention to this case presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis. Remember  accurate  timely diagnosis and appropriate management can significantly improve the prognosis for patients like Tom.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,13,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Demographics: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired school teacher residing in northern California with his wife. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially  and does not report any illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:  The patient has well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2 and has a history of high blood pressure currently managed with medication. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent subsequent angioplasty with a drug-eluting stent placement. Other than that  the patient has had no major illnesses  surgeries  or hospitalizations. There are no known drug allergies. Pre-existing heart damage due to his previous myocardial infarction makes him a candidate for infective endocarditis  with diabetes being an additional risk factor that could have potentially contributed to his overall vulnerability.  Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with a two-week history of progressive malaise  low-grade intermittent fever  night sweats  shortness of breath  and a new heart murmur. There is no significant finding from his physical examination apart from the new cardiac murmur  which suggests possible heart valve involvement. Previously  during a dental procedure  the patient did not receive prophylactic antibiotics because of a lack of recommendation in the guidelines for patients with coronary artery stents.   Lab Findings and Diagnosis:  Blood cultures reveal growth of Streptococcus viridans  implicating a Gram positive bacteria which commonly causes endocarditis  particularly after dental procedures or in patients with a heart valve disorder. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  showing mobile echodensities on the aortic valve consistent with vegetation. These findings were suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Approach: Considering current guidelines  the patient was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric antibiotic therapy with a combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone while awaiting culture results. After confirmation of Streptococcus viridans growth  antibiotic treatment was adjusted following an infectious disease consultation.  In conclusion  timely recognition of symptoms and initiating prompt  targeted antibiotic treatment is essential in managing patients with infective endocarditis  where the disease progression is likely to be life threatening  particularly in those with underlying cardiac conditions.                             
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,14,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I would like to present Mr. Garcia  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  who is in our care presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Mr. Garcia is a resident of San Antonio  Texas and lives with his wife. He worked as a construction labourer until he retired in 2020. Mr. Garcia's past medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 25 years ago  for which he is prescribed metformin  and hypertension  diagnosed five years ago  controlled with lisinopril. He is not addicted to any recreational drugs but has a history of heavy alcohol consumption  which he quit 2 years ago. He has no record of intravenous drug use or notable dental history. He does not have any prosthetic devices or artificial heart valves and has no prior history of infective endocarditis. Mr. Garcia is not a smoker and has no known allergies.  Recently  Mr. Garcia has presented with pronounced fatigue  unintentional weight loss  shortness of breath  intermittent fever  and a new heart murmur which prompted his primary care physician to refer him for further cardiac evaluation. He doesn’t have any family history of cardiac diseases. Blood works reflect elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Considering the literature  senior Hispanic males are reported to be at a higher risk of infective endocarditis  primarily due to factors such as prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension. The symptomology presented by Mr. Garcia fits the general presentation of infective endocarditis  and the echocardiography report further supports the diagnosis.  Our team is lean towards a broad-based antibiotic treatment plan for Mr. Garcia and will decide further course of action based on the sensitivity result of blood cultures.  (Note: Native valve endocarditis often affects populations with access to healthcare and prevalent risk factors like advanced age  male gender  and underlying chronic conditions. However  the instances and patterns of this condition can vary greatly.)
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,15,Title: Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male  Slide 1 - Introduction Infective endocarditis is a serious infection of the endocardial surfaces  typically affecting the heart valves. This presentation revolves around a patient suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis - the most common type of endocarditis.  Slide 2 - Patient Demographics Our patient is Mr. Smith  a 69-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban background. Given that the mean age at diagnosis of infective endocarditis is usually around the 6th decade of life and the tendency towards a male predominance  as reported in literature  Mr. Smith’s demographic is fairly typical for a patient diagnosed with this condition.  Slide 3 - Patient’s Background Mr. Smith is a retired engineer  a non-smoker  and consumes alcohol moderately. Based on his occupation and habits  he does not possess obvious exposures to heart valve damaging activities.  Slide 4 - Past Medical History Mr. Smith’s past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Approximately 10 years ago  he was diagnosed with a moderately severe mitral valve regurgitation but did not require surgery at that time.   Slide 5 - Symptoms and Presentation  Mr. Smith has been experiencing a low-grade fever for the past 3 weeks along with night sweats  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also noted slight changes in his urine color and a new onset of lower back pain.   Slide 6 - Physical Examination On examination  his vital signs were stable. However  a cardiac exam revealed a new murmur  suggestive of aortic or mitral regurgitation. Additionally  the presence of Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  and Roth spots in his eyes were recorded. These clinical signs  in conjunction with his symptoms  made us suspect infective endocarditis.  Slide 7 - Investigations and Diagnosis  Blood cultures were taken and an echocardiogram was carried out. With the finding of positive blood cultures and an echocardiographic evidence of a valvular vegetation  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.   Slide 8 - Summary In conclusion  this case highlights an elderly male with a history of mitral valve regurgitation who developed native-valve infective endocarditis  most likely due to his underlying heart condition. This presentation aims to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to improve the traditionally poor prognosis associated with infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,16,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Presentation  Patient Profile:  Mr. James Berman  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presents with symptoms indicative of potential native-valve infective endocarditis. A smoker for over two decades  Mr. Berman exhibits demographic trends commonly associated with infective endocarditis prevalence. According to Jenni A. et.al. in 2017  infection rates for this condition are typically higher among men  particularly those aged 30 to 60.   Medical History:  His background reveals a history of congenital heart disease  particularly a bicuspid aortic valve  which puts him in a high-risk category for infective endocarditis. The patient does not have any history of IV drug use  which is a common route of infection. However  he underwent a dental procedure about one month ago  which might be the possible source of bacteremia. The existing heart condition could potentially have facilitated the bacterial attachment and colonization leading to infective endocarditis.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Berman presented to us with a 10-day history of low-grade fever  associated with chills and night sweats. He has also been experiencing unexplained weight loss over the last three weeks  along with mild fatigue and shortness of breath  specifically during physical activity. Patient mentioned suffering from generalized aches  whose intensity increased over the past few days  particularly in the thoracic area.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  a heart murmur was heard suggesting a valvular heart disease  consistent with his known bicuspid aortic valve. Other findings included splinter hemorrhages on his fingers and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles.  Diagnostic Approach:  Given the combination of Mr. Berman's pre-existing heart condition  the recent dental procedure  and his clinical presentation  he was suspected to have native-valve infective endocarditis. Relevant investigations including blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiography were immediately ordered.  Conclusions:  The appropriate course of action will be dictated by the result of these investigations. Depending on the etiology of the infection  targeted antibiotic therapy will be instituted. Mr. Berman's heart valve status will be closely monitored and  if required  surgical intervention may also be considered. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,17,Patient Presentation:  I'd like to present a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. J  presenting with native-valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).   Past Medical History: Mr. J has a history of moderate to severe rheumatic heart disease  a known prevalent risk factor for native-valve IE. He also has a history of intravenous drug use  which stopped roughly fifteen years ago. Furthermore  he has had a past medical history of heart murmur and has been monitored for this for several years.   Demographics: The patient is a retired mechanic and is a current smoker with at least 40 pack-years of smoking. He lives in a semi-urban area and has been relatively active till this point  with no disability. He lives with his wife who assists him with medication compliance. There is no known family history of heart diseases.  Presenting Illness: Mr. J was initially seen in the Emergency Department with a 1-week history of progressive symptoms  including fever  fatigue  anorexia  and unintentional weight loss.   Physical Examination: On examination  the patient was febrile and looked acutely ill. There were no visible skin lesions or fingers clubbing. A new-onset heart murmur was audible  and splenomegaly was noted.   In conclusion  this 65-year-old male with a history of rheumatic heart disease is now presenting with symptoms suggestive of native-valve IE. The physical examination findings are strongly supporting this diagnosis.  The demographic profile of a native-valve IE patient commonly found in literature underlies that the condition affects older males  from the age of 50-70  and with underlying heart conditions including rheumatic heart disease  valve abnormalities or intravenous drug use. This presentation fits the pattern.  Further evaluation including blood cultures and echocardiography is planned to confirm a diagnosis and guide treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,18,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Presentation   Patient Information:  Mr. Lawson  a 63-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use in his early adult years  presents with a 3-week history of intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  and lower back pain. He is an occasional smoker and has been treated in the past for recreational drug addiction. He is unemployed and lives alone.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for chronic Hepatitis C from intravenous drug abuse  for which he is not currently on treatment due to patient's reluctancy. He also has a long standing history of hypertension that is being managed with Hydrochlorothiazide 50mg/day. Mr. Lawson had a minor stroke three years ago with full recovery.   Current Presentation:  Mr. Lawson reports intermittent fevers around 101 degrees Fahrenheit along with chills. He states he has noticed unintentional weight loss over the past month and that his low back pain is causing him discomfort  especially while he rests. On physical examination  he appears fatigued with pale conjunctiva and has a murmur audible upon cardiac auscultation. There was no observable skin rash or peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.   Plan:  Because of his symptoms and clinical findings  there is a concern for possible native-valve infective endocarditis. A complete hematological panel  blood cultures to identify the causative organism  an echocardiogram to look for vegetations and evaluate valve function  and possibly consultation with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management are recommended.  Demographic Note:  Infective endocarditis  particularly native-valve endocarditis  often presents in individuals with risk factors such as intravenous drug use  valve disease  and age above 60. There is also evidence that men are more at risk than women for infective endocarditis. More common in developed countries  it cannot be neglected that it affects individuals of any race  socioeconomic status  or geographical location. Thus  this case presentation serves to increase awareness of endocarditis in a typical presentation including history of intravenous drug use and hypertension. Further  it emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention  as the complications of this condition may be severe.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,19,Patient Presentation:  We're discussing Mr. Luis Montoya  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  who is recently diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Literature indicates that infective endocarditis predominantly afflicts older adults  with a particular predilection towards males.   Historically  Mr. Montoya has lead an active lifestyle  currently working as a construction manager. He has no history of recreational drug use  pertinent because of the association between drug use and endocarditis. He has a longstanding history of poor dental hygiene and chronic periodontal disease  which often predispose individuals to this type of infection.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Montoya was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  and his disease has been relatively well-managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications  including diet and exercise. Additionally  he has been treated for hypertension for the last 5 years  controlled primarily by a regimen of losartan.  Importantly  he had a bout of rheumatic fever in his childhood  which can predispose to valvular heart disease and further increase the risk of infective endocarditis. However  no valvular complications or anomalies have been documented in his adult life during regular physical examinations and annual check-ups.  Mr. Montoya recently started complain of intermittent fevers  night sweats  and weight loss  along with increasing fatigue and weakness over the past few weeks. This clinical scenario raised suspicion for infective endocarditis. He was sent for further diagnostic workup including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  which confirmed the presence of vegetations on the valve leaflets and helped us make the definitive diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. His treatment plan now requires a tailored antibiotic regimen and careful follow-up  with potential surgical intervention being kept as possibility depending on the progression of his condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,20,Patient Presentation for Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  We have a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting with symptoms consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Past Medical History: This patient's previous medical history reveals significant findings such as diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension that's been well-controlled with medication. He also underwent a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. Furthermore  the patient doesn't have a known history of illicit drug use  dental procedures  or recent invasive medical procedures.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient came in complaining of fever persisting for several weeks  night sweats  malaise  and an unintended loss of weight of about 10 pounds in the last month. He also reported dyspnea on exertion and a new heart murmur was detected on physical examination.  From the patient's history and presenting symptoms  we suspect native-valve infective endocarditis. As we are aware  native-valve endocarditis is more common in males and in patients between the ages of 30 to 60  and this patient's demographic aligns well with this epidemiological data. This case’s diabetes mellitus also increases his chance of acquiring infections  including infective endocarditis.   An echocardiogram has been scheduled for further confirmation of valve involvement  and blood cultures have been drawn to determine the causative organism. The patient will be started on empiric antibiotic therapy pending results of the blood cultures.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,21,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Presentation: I would like to discuss a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Demographics: He hails from a suburban area  is college-educated  and recently retired from a job in finance. He is a non-smoker but is a moderate alcohol drinker  consuming about 2-3 drinks per day. He is living with his partner and they have no children. The patient is financially stable and has a private insurance for health coverage.  Medical History: His past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are well under control with medication. He has had no surgical interventions in the past and is compliant with his pharmacological regimen which includes Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and Metformin 1000 mg twice a day for his diabetes. His BMI is 28  slightly overweight but he has been maintaining this weight for the past few years.   He has no known drug allergies. His vaccination records are up to date and he does not have a personal or family history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death.   Current Presentation: He presented to our facilities with a 12-day history of progressive  generalized weakness coupled with fever and chills  poor appetitie  and weight loss. He also reported shortness of breath  fatigue  and mild joint pains. On physical examination  he appeared unwell  with pale conjunctivas  mild oedema in his ankles  and a new-onset murmur was noted on cardiovascular examination.   Given his clinical presentation  additional investigations  including blood cultures and a transesophageal echocardiography  have been organized to confirm the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis.  This is his first presentation with such complaints and if confirmed  the diagnosis would represent new onset native-valve infective endocarditis. A multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  infectious disease specialists  and possibly cardiovascular surgery will be required for management and treatment. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,22,Title: Clinical Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Our patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male presenting with complaints of intermittent fever  fatigue  and weight loss over the past four to six weeks. Additionally  he has described episodes of night sweats and a newly developed persistent cough.   He lives in a rural area and has a history of marginal hygiene. He works as a farmer  is a smoker of 20 years  and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He does not report any illicit drug use. Family history is notable for his father who was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease in his early 60s.   Past Medical History: Upon further investigation  the patient’s past medical history was found to be significant for rheumatic fever as a child  for which he received adequate treatment. He also has a known history of bicuspid aortic valve  a condition that is associated with an increased risk of native-valve infective endocarditis.  He has a history of hypertension  managed with lisinopril  and reports no known drug allergies. He has not required any previous cardiac surgery. His records also indicate he had a dental extraction about 2 months back.   Discussion: Native-valve infective endocarditis primarily affects individuals with underlying congenital heart conditions or a history of rheumatic disease  including adults aged over 50. Male gender dominates over female with respect to disease incidence. Caucasian individuals aged between 40-60 have a higher prevalence  with poor dental hygiene being a risk factor due to possible oral bacterial introduction.   Our patient's history of a bicuspid aortic valve  history of rheumatic fever  poor dental hygiene  coupled with his clinical symptoms logically suggests the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. His recent dental extraction could serve as a possible focus of bacterial entry.   It is important that this diagnosis is confirmed promptly  as untreated infective endocarditis can lead to serious complications  including heart failure  systemic embolism  and death. Hence  this patient requires thorough evaluation including blood cultures and echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Conclusion: In conclusion  the clinical representation is consistent with the demographic trends observed in native-valve infective endocarditis. Continuous comprehensive patient evaluation is necessary for an accurate diagnosis leading to prompt treatment and minimizing fatal complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,23,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 70 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Accountant  Demographics: Mr. Doe is a representative case as studies have shown that native valve infective endocarditis more commonly affects older adults over the age of 60 and Caucasians are at a slightly higher risk. It happens predominantly in males.  Past Medical History: He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 20 years ago  which he manages with diet control and metformin. Mr. Doe also has a known history of mild aortic stenosis for which he has been on a β-blocker  but has not required surgical intervention. His dental health is notably poor with many untreated cavities and missing teeth. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  Presenting Complaints:  - Mr. Doe presents with a 3-week history of low-grade fevers  fatigue and a productively cough with streaks of blood in his sputum. - He also complains of weight loss and night sweats. - He experienced a sudden  acute onset of left-sided weakness today.  Examination: On physical examination  a systolic murmur is heard over the precordium. An infarct is suspected due to neurologic deficits observed. Multiple petechiae and small painless erythematous lesions are present on his palms and soles.  Reason for Suspecting Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis:  The history of aortic valve disease along with typical symptoms like persistent fevers  malaise  weight loss  and the observed cardiac murmur arouse concerns for infective endocarditis. The presence of Janeway lesions and petechiae  which are cutaneous manifestations related to infective endocarditis  further contribute to this suspicion. His poor oral health and resultant transient bacteremia might be a possible gateway for the infection.  In the context of his acute neurologic symptoms  a concern exists about potential septic emboli causing stroke  which can be a serious complication of infective endocarditis. It shall be confirmed after additional examinations.  This presentation emphasizes the need for prompt diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis  especially in patients with underlying heart valve abnormalities  to prevent potentially fatal complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,24,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  I. Introduction: Presenting a case of Mr. Sanchez  a 62-year-old male of Hispanic descent who has visited our healthcare facility today. He clearly demonstrates signs consistent with the clinical symptoms of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).   II. Background and Demographic Information: Mr. Sanchez hails from an urban  low-income community  uncovering the strong correlation between socioeconomic status and increased risk for NVIE as established in medical literature. Born and raised in Mexico  he moved to the United States 35 years ago and has a history of substance use  specifically intravenous heroin  which is a significant risk factor for NVIE.  Mr. Sanchez is a construction worker by profession and is not insured. English is his second language  which might lead to potential barriers in health literacy and healthcare access.  III. Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease at 22  a known predisposing factor for the development of NVIE. He also has a 10-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes which has potential implications in the progression of infectious diseases like endocarditis. He admits not being very compliant with his diabetes medications primarily due to financial and literacy barriers.  Additionally  he was dealt with an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia five years ago  another known risk factor for endocarditis. No history of prosthetic valve surgery is found  confirming the case as Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  IV. Current Manifestations: He presents with fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  and fatigue all of which have persisted for three weeks. Following physical examination  he shows signs of peripheral manifestations of Endocarditis including Janeway lesions  Osler's nodes  and Roth spots consistent with the diagnostic findings in NVIE.  Mr. Sanchez's case requires in-depth investigation for further confirmation of NVIE involving echocardiograms and blood cultures to guide effective treatment. His social circumstances  language barrier  and lack of insurance indeed underline the importance of a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to his healthcare management. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,25,Presentation Title: A Case Study of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Profile: Our patient is Mr. Smith  a 60-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban area.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known medical history of Hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which are commonly controlled with statins and metformin. He is also an ex-smoker who quit 15 years ago and drinks alcohol socially. Relevant home medications include aspirin  a statin  metformin  and a low dose ACE inhibitor. There were no allergies of any form.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith has been experiencing symptoms for approximately four weeks prior to presentation. His early symptoms were relatively nonspecific – low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss. Over the last two weeks  his symptoms have worsened and he has developed intermittent high fever  chills  night sweats  arthralgia  and a new-onset murmur that was not present on his prior check-ups.   On the physical exam  besides being febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F)  He demonstrated a harsh  blowing systolic murmur best appreciated at the right upper sternal border. Few petechiae were present in the conjunctivae and there was peripheral evidence of endocarditis in the form of minor splinter hemorrhage under the fingernails.   Further Evaluation: Blood cultures were taken from three different veins and all identified streptococcus viridans  a common culprit in native valve endocarditis. In addition to lab studies  an echocardiogram was performed which revealed a mobile vegetation on the aortic valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  This patient’s case is characteristic of many presentations of native-valve infective endocarditis - prolonged nonspecific symptoms  followed by cardiovascular signs as the disease progresses. Among the key concerns for this patient are septicemia and potential embolic events due to the mobile vegetation on the aortic valve.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,26,Title: Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 50-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J D  from a urban setting. He is a non-smoker and his alcohol consumption is moderate. His socio-economic status is middle class and he works as an accountant.  Presenting symptoms:  Mr. J D came to the hospital complaining of persistent fever for the past few weeks  fatigue  malaise  and shortness of breath. He also reported night sweats  weight loss and intermittent chest pain.   Medical History:  The patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well-controlled with medication (Metformin). He also suffers from a mild form of mitral valve prolapse  without regurgitation  which was detected 5 years prior during a routine check-up. There is no family history of any heart diseases or stroke. Mr. J D is not on regular check-ups with a cardiologist for his mild mitral valve prolapse since he didn't require any surgical intervention or medication for the condition.   Upon examination  he presented with symptoms of heart failure  such as edema in lower extremities and rales in the lung bases  typically pointing to pulmonary congestion. There were no signs of skin manifestations such as petechiae or Janeway lesions.    This presentation along with his medical history strongly suggests the potential diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further examination and appropriate investigative measures such as blood culture  echocardiography  and other necessary tests will be taken to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of the infection. Immediate action would be to start empiric antibiotic therapy considering the severity of the symptoms.  The case does represent a typical demographic profile for the disease  with literature suggesting that infective endocarditis is more common in men  usually between the ages of 30-60  and those with preexisting heart conditions  including mitral valve prolapse. The concomitant presence of diabetes can also increase the risk due to a compromised immune system.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,27,Patient Presentation  We present a case of a 59-year-old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient is a retired teacher  married  a non-smoker  and reports only social drinking. He lives in a rural Midwest community in the United States.   The patient's past medical history is significant for Type II diabetes mellitus  managed by oral hypoglycemic  and mild hypertension controlled with lifestyle modifications. He also has a history of gout  managed by occasional use of colchicine. He has no known drug allergies.  Over the past two weeks  the patient has experienced fatigue  low-grade fevers  night sweats  and unintended weight loss of approximately 10 lbs. More recently  he noticed the presence of petechiae on his lower extremities. He has also been experiencing joint pain and muscle aches. He reports no previous similar episodes. His family history is non-contributory  with no record of genetic or autoimmune disorders.  The patient initially presented to his primary care physician  who found a previously undiscovered murmur during a routine physical examination. The primary care physician had the forethought to consider infective endocarditis given the constellation of symptoms and referred the patient for further evaluation.  In this case  the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis has been made on the basis of the patient's clinical presentation  a new regurgitant murmur found on examination  and the presence of typical signs and symptoms such as fever  night sweats  weight loss  petechial rashes  and arthralgia. These findings are in alignment with the modified Duke's Criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   The patient has been admitted to the hospital for treatment and further diagnostic procedures  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram.                                                                                Demographic and epidemiological literature suggest that the incidence of infective endocarditis is higher in males and tends to increase with age. Moreover  conditions like diabetes mellitus and rural living  as in this patient  are both associated with an increased risk of the disease. This presentation is thus consistent with reported demographic patterns for native valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,28,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE) in an Elderly Patient  Patient Introduction:  We have a 73-year-old Caucasian male admitted with a suspected case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). Our patient is a retired banker  living independently with his wife. The patient resides in an urban setup and has a history of frequent outdoor activities and community participation.   History Presentation:  The patient has a significant history of moderate-to-severe rheumatic heart disease  diagnosed 15 years ago. His medical regimen includes beta-blockers  diuretics  and anticoagulants for managing the condition. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus type II five years back. There is no known family history of any cardiac diseases.  The patient has a history of non-restrictive alcohol consumption and is a former smoker with a 30-year pack history. He quit 10 years ago. He does not participate in any illicit drug use.  Present Complaint:  The patient presents with a three-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. He has been experiencing shortness of breath  especially upon exertion and at night  along with persistent cough. He also reports a diminishing appetite and increased frequency of urination.  Examination and Lab studies:  Upon examination  the patient appears fatigued. His vital signs indicate a fever of 100.4°F and a heart rate of 90 bpm. We noted a systolic murmur during auscultation. Laboratory investigation results are awaited but preliminary workup includes a complete blood count  urinalysis  renal function test  and blood cultures. Echocardiography will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and determine the damage to the valve.   Conclusion:  Given this patient's age  history of heart disease  and clinical signs  we suspect a case of NVIE. Comprehensive care would encompass an interdisciplinary approach  involving cardiology  infectious disease experts  and primarily care physicians  to manage the condition.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,29,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Good day to all. I am presenting a case today on a patient diagnosed with Native-valve Infective Endocarditis.   Patient Information: The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Smith  from suburban surroundings  participating in moderate physical activities and maintaining a balanced diet. He was a smoker in his earlier years but has quit the habit for the past 5 years. The male demographic represents the majority cases of Infective Endocarditis  with the median age being 52 to 62 years old.   Presenting Situation: Mr. Smith initially presented with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He has also noticed a strange skin rash and tiny purple and red spots on his body. Physical examination showed signs of heart murmur  and his temperature was mildly elevated. It is all in correlations with literature in which  fever (90%) and heart murmurs (85%) are usually present in endocarditis.  Past Medical History: According to his medical records  Mr. Smith has a past medical history of rheumatic fever during his childhood and more recently  a diagnosis of degenerative aortic stenosis. He also has a controlled case of Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  on medication for both. Our patient thus falls into a high-risk group for Infective Endocarditis  as he has pre-existing heart conditions with lead to turbulent blood flow and microtrauma within the heart  facilitating bacterial colonization.  On further Investigations: Blood cultures were positive  and an echocardiogram demonstrated valvular vegetations. Together with clinical findings  these results confirm the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   In relation to demographics  far fewer patients in the West with IE have a rheumatic heart disease  like our patient  whereas it was used to be the norm decades ago. Nowadays  with our aging populations and the increasing use of invasive medical procedures  time is changing.   That concludes the presentation of our patient  Mr. Smith  diagnosed with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.   Thank you.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,30,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Introduction   Our patient today is a 50-year-old male  globally representative of the average age most affected by this invasive disease.  Slide 2: Demographics   This gentleman is of Caucasian ethnicity  putting him in the racial group most frequently diagnosed with infective endocarditis in developed countries such as the United States and Europe.  Slide 3: Occupational and Social History   He is unemployed  which is not uncommon in advanced cases due to the debilitating nature of the disease. He has a history of intravenous drug use  a major risk factor for infective endocarditis.  Slide 4: Past Medical History   Our patient has a past medical history consistent with literature on risk factors for infective endocarditis. He has a 10-year history of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU)  another key risk. In addition to that  he has also been diagnosed with Hepatitis C secondary to his intravenous drug use  which predisposes him to various infections.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation   He has been experiencing fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and some joint pain for several weeks  all of which are indicative of infective endocarditis.   Slide 6: Cardiac History   He has had mitral valve prolapse  a common predisposing cardiac condition among patients with native-valve infective endocarditis. However  it has been asymptomatic until now.  Slide 7: Complications   Our patient also shows signs of septicemia and has recently been experiencing neurological symptoms  which potentially points to an embolic stroke - a severe complication of untreated infective endocarditis.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case highlights the multifaceted clinical presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis and the importance of understanding its related risk factors and potential complications. As demonstrated in this scenario  prompt diagnosis and proper management of the disease are crucial to prevent devastating outcomes like the ones faced by our patient.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,31,Title: Presentation of an Adult Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Roberts Age: 60 Years Occupation: Retired engineer Ethnicity: Caucasian Place of Residence: Arizona  USA  Introduction:   Mr. Roberts is a 60-year-old retired Caucasian engineer residing in Arizona  USA. The reason for his presentation today is symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis (IE) affecting his native heart valves.  Medical History:  Upon reviewing his history  Mr. Roberts was diagnosed with moderate aortic stenosis a few years ago  a condition known to be one of the risk factors for native valve IE. He has been managing the condition through medication.   Additionally  he has been suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he has been under regular treatment. He has no known allergies and has had no prior surgeries. He doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. He has a family history of heart disease. His father had ischemic heart disease and his mother had rheumatic heart disease.  Presentation Symptoms:  Recently  Mr. Roberts has presented with symptoms of continuous fever  night sweats  fatigue  weight loss  and an inexplicable persistent cough. He also reported pain in joints  poor appetite  and heart murmurs. These symptoms are consistent with a case of Infective Endocarditis.  Upon physical examination  Osler nodes and Janeway lesions were observed on his skin. There was also evidence of anemia evident from his previous blood report. Note that these seem to mark the onset of more serious complications  indicating the urgency for an immediate clinical intervention.  As per the current literature  Mr. Roberts fits the demographic representation for native-valve infective endocarditis. Several studies show that such cases are more frequent in male patients above the age of 50 with a history of valvular heart disease.   Conclusion:  Considering the age  medical history  and current symptoms of our patient  it appears that Mr. Roberts is likely suffering from infective endocarditis of his native valves. Suggest the immediate commencement of a specific diagnostic path  which can be particularly complex due to the need for specific blood cultures and imaging techniques. Attending physician to conduct further tests for the accurate diagnosis of Mr. Roberts' condition and to determine the most effective course of treatment.  It is essential that the patient be treated promptly to prevent any further health complications such as heart failure  stroke  and other life-threatening situations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,32,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use and chronic Hepatitis C. He is a retired construction worker who has been living alone in a rural environment since his wife passed away 3 years ago. He presented to the emergency department complaining of a 3-week history of malaise  night sweats  intermittent fever  and unintentional weight loss. He also reported worsening weakness and fatigue  making it increasingly difficult for him to perform daily activities.   Over the past week  he has noted an increase in the frequency and intensity of his fevers and has also developed shortness of breath  particularly upon exertion. At times  this has been accompanied by a non-productive cough. He denies experiencing chest pain  headache  vision changes  and neurologic symptoms.   This patient has a long history of tobacco use (40 pack-years) but quit 10 years ago. He has documented intravenous drug misuse in his past but asserts he has been sober for 20 years. The patient reports no significant use of alcohol. The patient has no known medication allergies.   The patient brought his medications  which include furosemide 40 mg daily for leg edema  omeprazole 40 mg daily for gastroesophageal reflux disease  and a multivitamin. He is not regularly followed by any physician and does not have regular check-ups. He claims he has not had any vaccinations within the last 10 years. As far as his family history is concerned  his father died at the age of 65 from a heart attack  and his mother is alive at 85 with hypertension and diabetes.   In this case  the patient presents a classic case of infective endocarditis  which is particularly prevalent in males around 60 years of age with a history of intravenous drug use. Studies show that endocarditis affects men twice as often as women and is most common among people between ages 30 and 60. Prior intravenous drug use causes venous scarring  presenting an opportunity for bacterial growth. His complaints of fatigue  unidentified fevers  and weight loss are common symptoms of infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,33,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Presentation:   We will discuss a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. A. who presents to the clinic with signs and symptoms suggesting infective endocarditis (IE). Literature indicates higher occurrence of native valve IE in older adults  especially men. The case study is a representation of the typical demographic of an individual diagnosed with native valve IE.  Chief Complaint:   Mr. A came to the emergency room with persistent fever of 101°F (38.3°C) that has been ongoing for two weeks  associated with fatigue  chills  and unintentional loss of weight.  Background and Medical History:  Mr. A is a retired construction worker. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only socially. He has a history of bicuspid aortic valve disorder  which he was diagnosed with five years ago. Other than this  his past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He underwent a tooth extraction approximately three weeks ago of which he did not take prophylactic antibiotics prior  as the need for such in a patient without a history of IE is not standard practice.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  a systolic heart murmur was noted  along with petechiae on lower extremity and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. His temperature was elevated  and blood pressure was normal.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Blood culture tests were performed which grew Streptococcus viridans  a common causative organism for native valve IE  particularly after dental procedures. An echocardiogram was ordered which revealed vegetations on the aortic valve  solidifying the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion:  Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infection of the heart endothelium and valves  typically caused by bacteria  but can also be due to other microorganisms or fungi. The incidence of IE is higher in males  older adults  and those with pre-existing heart conditions involving the valves. IE is often characterized by fever  heart murmurs  vascular and immunologic phenomena. Advanced age  diabetes  and the presence of a native heart valve condition (as in Mr. A's case) are known risk factors.  The transmission of bacteria causing native valve IE typically occurs after routine daily activities such as tooth brushing and certain medical or dental procedures. Prompt recognition and treatment of IE is crucial as it can lead to severe complications  including heart failure and systemic embolism. It underscores the importance of good oral hygiene and preventative care in at-risk populations. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,34,Introduction: Good day  colleagues. Today  I will be presenting a case of a patient with native valve Infective Endocarditis.   Patient Demographics: Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  who was born and resides in the United States. He is retired and lives with his wife. Literature shows that males are slightly more affected (60%) by this condition with the mean age group affected being 30-60 years old  which makes Mr. Smith's demographics quite typical.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for moderate alcohol use  but he stopped drinking around 10 years ago  and he has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. He has been previously diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  for which he is on appropriate medication. He has no known drug allergies.  Presenting symptoms: Mr. Smith presented to the ER complaining of intermittent fever  fatigue  and night sweats for the past three weeks. He also noted a sudden weight loss recently  which he associated with a decrease in appetite. Upon further probing  he reported that he was experiencing occasional chest pain and shortness of breath.  Diagnostic Results: On physical examination  Mr. Smith was found to have a new heart murmur  and his Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart. Blood culture results were positive  indicating bacteremia. Further  echocardiography demonstrated vegetations on his native valves  pointing towards infectious endocarditis.   In Conclusion: Considering Mr. Smith's advanced age  chronic smoking history  and COPD  he is in the high-risk category for infective endocarditis. The presentation of persistent fever  weakness  weight loss alongside positive blood cultures and echocardiography findings leads us to confirm the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics and is currently under evaluation for possible surgical intervention.   Thank you for your time  and I am open to any questions or input on this case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,35,"Title: Patient Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: The patient is a 50-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use. He strongly fits the demographic range for infective endocarditis (IE) as per reviewed datasets attributing the highest rates of IE to middle-aged males (40-60 years old)  particularly those with a history of drug use.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient first began to experience vague  non-specific symptoms including fever  night sweats  chills  and an approximate weight loss of 15 lbs over the past two months. He initially dismissed these symptoms as signs of mild flu  but decided to seek medical advice when he developed acute shortness of breath and noticed dark-colored urine.   Localizing Symptoms: Taking a further look at the symptoms  the patient was found to have Osler’s nodes (painful nodules on fingers or toes) and Janeway lesions (painless red spots on palms or soles) – both being significant findings in endocarditis. Petechiae were also evident in the oral mucosa. The patient reported that he had a new-onset murmur  characterized by a mid-systolic """"click"""" that wasn't present in his previous medical examinations.  History: Most notable from his history is the persistent intravenous drug use  putting him at high risk for IE  in particular with microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He has previous episodes of minor infections due to his drug use  but never any serious musculoskeletal or cardiac conditions. The patient reported regular use of heroin  which he’d been injecting for several years. He also lives alone  in conditions that would be considered marginal  another important risk factor for IE.  Conclusion: In summary  the middle-aged patient with a significant history of intravenous drug use presents with distinctive signs of infective endocarditis. Given his age  gender  lifestyle factors  and drug usage  he fits within the recognized high-risk group for this condition. Further diagnostic tests  such as blood culture and echocardiography  should be pursued to confirm this diagnosis and to determine the extent of the disease. Immediate consultation with a cardiologist is also suggested. It’s crucial to underline the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive management in this patient to prevent possible devastating outcomes like heart failure  systemic infections  and even death."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,36,"Patient Presentation:  """"Today  I present a 53-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Literature emphasizes the male predominance and the median age group being the middle-aged in this condition  thus correlating to our patient's demographics. His identifying data includes residing in an urban setting with a lower socioeconomic background  which research shows is commonly associated with a higher prevalence of this disease.   The patient was initially presented with intermittent fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss observed over the past few weeks. He also reported a heart murmur that was noted a few years ago but was not subjected to any medical intervention. He denies any history of drug abuse but has a significant history of unhealthy oral hygiene practices and poor dental health  adding to the probable risk factors of developing his present condition.  In terms of his past medical history  the patient was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus about seven years ago and has inconsistent compliance on medication leading to mostly uncontrolled blood sugar levels. He is also a former smoker with an extensive smoking history of about 30 pack-years. Apart from diabetes  he has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  but no known heart elements or autoimmune disorders.   Family history suggests a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases  as both his parents suffered from coronary artery diseases. He is not known to have any allergies  and the only medication he is on is Metformin for his diabetes.  On examination  he was febrile and appeared chronically ill. Cardiac auscultation revealed a previously undiagnosed heart murmur which raised the suspicion of infective endocarditis.  In conclusion  the patient’s demographic data  clinical symptoms  lifestyle  past medical history  and physical examination findings all contribute to his current diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.""""

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,37,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Today  let's present the case of Mr. Roger  a 68-year-old African American male with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. He hails from a low socio-economic background and lives in urban Detroit  Michigan. Mr. Roger is a retired machinist  a widower  with 3 adult children and lives alone.   Past Medical History: His past medical history includes hypertension  diabetes mellitus type II  and chronic kidney disease. About two years ago  Mr. Roger was diagnosed with moderate aortic stenosis  a condition that predisposes him to native-valve endocarditis. He has been a smoker for over 40 years and drinks alcohol socially.  Presenting Illness: Mr. Roger presented with a two-week history of generalized malaise  intermittent fever  and a recent onset of a new heart murmur. On examination  he had a systolic murmur  low-grade fever  and was found to have several petechiae on his lower extremities. His blood tests showed elevated ESR and CRP  indicating an inflammatory process. The preliminary blood culture report showed the growth of Streptococcus viridans  indicating a probable case of infective endocarditis.   Management: Mr. Roger was promptly admitted for inpatient care and was started on intravenous antibacterial therapy after consultation with an infectious disease specialist. An echocardiogram confirmed vegetations on his aortic valve with mild valvular insufficiency. His blood glucose level and blood pressure were managed appropriately  as per his medical history of diabetes and hypertension.   Moving Forward: Mr. Roger will require careful monitoring of his cardiac function and the response to treatment. If his condition fails to improve  he may need further interventions like valvular surgery. He may also benefit from lifestyle modification counselling  addressing his smoking habits  and resources for managing his chronic diseases at home.   This case illustrates the textbook presentation and associated risk factors of native-valve endocarditis. It highlights the need for preemptive strategies and prompt treatment  particularly among populations at risk  to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,38,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient   Case Presentation:  Patient Information:   We have a male patient  aged 73  a Caucasian from urban-suburban setting. He is a retired school teacher and currently not involved in any strenuous physical or occupational activities. He is not a smoker nor a frequent alcohol drinker  but he does present with a personal background of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes).   Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness:  The patient reports feeling fatigued and experiencing intermittent fevers for the past two weeks. He also notes decreased appetite  unintentional weight loss  and night sweats. Additionally  he reports more specific symptoms of chest discomfort and shortness of breath  particularly when lying flat.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 15 years ago which is currently managed by metformin. His last recorded HbA1c was 7.1%  indicating relatively good blood sugar control. Eleven years ago  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  treated by statins. No history of rheumatic heart disease. He got a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease 10 years ago with occasional use of NSAIDs for pain relief.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient demonstrated a temperature of 38.3°C  heart rate of 92 bpm  and blood pressure of 132/85 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new cardiac murmur  not noted in prior medical encounters. There were some scattered petechiae present upon skin examination and evidence of mild peripheral edema.   Impressions and Plan:  The combination of these findings - generalized symptoms  presence of a cardiac murmur and fever  coupled with his history of diabetes  makes infective endocarditis a possibility to consider. Laboratory tests  including blood cultures  and a transthoracic echocardiogram have been ordered for confirmation. If suspicions are confirmed  infectious disease consultation and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy will be pursued.   This combination of presenting symptoms and relevant past medical history is in line with epidemiological literature which indicates older males  specifically with a history of diabetes  are at an increased risk for developing native-valve infective endocarditis.   Please note that individual patient presentations can vary greatly  and a comprehensive clinical examination and diagnostic workup should always be performed.   Thank you for your attention.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,39,Title: Case Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Good evening members of the medical team    Today we discuss Mr. John Brown  a 65-year-old African American male patient who has presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of fatigue  fever  and newly developed shortness of breath.  Mr. Brown has a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2  well-controlled with metformin  and mild hypertension  managed with lisinopril. He also has a history of moderate alcohol consumption  about 3-4 drinks per week  and does not smoke. He works as an accountant and lives with his wife in suburban Maryland. There is no known family history of heart disease.   Over the recent weeks  Mr. Brown has experienced a low-grade fever  malaise  fatigue  and night sweats. Additionally  he reports a weight loss of about ten pounds in that same time frame due to poor appetite. In the past few days  he noticed an increasing shortness of breath  particularly while doing household chores  and intermittent chest discomfort.  On clinical examination  he appeared to be moderately ill  and uncomfortably dyspneic even at rest. His temperature is 100.9 °F  blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  pulse is 110 per minute  and his respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  Heart auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur suggestive of valvular disease while lung auscultation indicates possible pulmonary edema. He does not exhibit overt peripheral signs of infective endocarditis such as Janeway lesions or Osler nodes.   Lab results showed a white blood cell count of 13 500/mm3  ESR 65 mm/hr  and CRP 45 mg/L. His blood sugar was slightly elevated at 165mg/dL. Most notably  three out of three blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram identified an oscillating intracardiac mass on the mitral valve  indicative of a vegetation  consistent with the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  In closing  Mr. Brown's diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is supported by his ongoing febrile state  new mitral valve regurgitation murmur  and the presence of a vegetation on echocardiography. His risk factors include his age  male sex  diabetes  and hypertension  which are known predispositions for native-valve infective endocarditis as seen in the literature. He has been started on the standard regimen of intravenous antibiotics and will be monitored closely in the hospital.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,40,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Mr. James Harrison  a 65-year-old Caucasian male from Des Moines  Iowa  presents with a two-week history of generalized weakness  intermittent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He is a retired farmer  married with two children  and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Harrison has a documented history of rheumatic fever during childhood with no surgical interventions. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus about ten years ago  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. There have been episodes of poor blood glucose control  but he claims adherence to medication guidelines. He also has a history of hypertension  managed with standard antihypertensive drugs.   Potential Risk Factors: Mr. Harrison's occupation brought him into close contact with farm animals  which could potentially expose him to Coxiella burnetii  an organism associated with Q-fever endocarditis. In his diabetes management  he required occasional administration of insulin during bouts of uncontrolled hyperglycemia  which presents potential for exposure to skin organisms. In addition  the patient’s age  background of rheumatic heart disease  and uncontrolled diabetes makes him a high-risk individual for native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).  Clinically Compelling Data: Physical examination reveals a new grade III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex and low-grade fever. Mr. Harrison does not display abnormal skin findings such as Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  or splinter hemorrhages. Lab results indicate elevated ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and CRP (C-Reactive Protein)  indicating inflammation  accompanied by mild anemia.  Diagnosis: Given the history of rheumatic heart disease  the new onset of murmurs  prolonged generalized symptoms  elevated inflammatory markers coupled with the absence of an alternate explanation for his symptoms  Mr. Harrison meets Duke criteria for probable Infective Endocarditis.  Next Steps: This clinical scenario and patient symptoms warrant further diagnostic workup  including blood cultures and Trans-Esophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm the diagnosis and inspect for valvular damage. Pending those results  empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated to manage the suspected NVIE. Moreover  consultation with a cardiologist for close monitoring and consideration of potential surgical intervention  if any signs of cardiac complications or failure of medical management  is prudent.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,41,Patient Presentation:  Hello everyone  today we have a 59-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. R  presenting with native valve infective endocarditis. Mr. R is a long-term smoker and was formerly a heavy alcohol consumer  but he has been sober for the past five years. He has history of type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago and has hypertension  under control with daily medication. He has no known drug allergies. He does not have a family history of heart disease  stroke  or any inherited conditions.  Recent Literature Evidence:  Native valve endocarditis is commonly found within the same demographic as our patient Mr. R. According to a 2015 study by Murdoch et al. published in the Journal of the American Medical Association  infective endocarditis is most frequently found in older patients around the age of Mr. R  with an average age finding of 57.6 years. Additionally  the study revealed that males are more susceptible than females  with a male:female ratio of 1.6:1. Out of these patients  a majority are Caucasian.  In terms of risk factors  Mr. R's long-term tobacco use  previous alcohol consumption  hypertension  and diabetes are common contributors to the development of endocarditis  as they cause alterations and disturbances to the heart’s normal function and blood flow. All these contributing factors can promote bacterial adhesion and proliferation  resulting in infective endocarditis.  In conclusion  our patient Mr. R is a typical case of a patient with native valve infective endocarditis  as his age  gender  race  and medical history align well with those of the prototypical patient population found in the literature. This comprehensive understanding of Mr. R's demographics and history will aid in his medical management and tailored treatment plan moving forward.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,42,Subject: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Patient Profile: A 64-year-old Caucasian male patient has been admitted to the hospital presenting with symptoms that align with native-valve infective endocarditis. His symptomatology includes fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and a new heart murmur.  History: The patient's past medical history shows significant chronic conditions related to cardiovascular health. He has been managing Hypertension for the past 10 years and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago. The patient also has a history of mitral valve prolapse  identified during a routine medical exam around the same time as his Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis.  Lifestyle: The patient is a retired engineer  has quit smoking about seven years ago after being a pack-a-day smoker for 25 years. He drinks alcohol socially  mainly during family events and holidays. His daily diet is relatively balanced  but admits it could stand to be healthier. The patient lives in a suburban area with his wife. He exercises with moderate-intensity activities like walking and gardening about three times a week.  Epidemiological relevance: According to CDC and literature surveys  individuals over 60  particularly males  have a higher risk of developing infective endocarditis. Predisposing cardiac conditions such as mitral valve prolapse  being a noticeable demographic group contributing to native valve endocarditis. Smoking and alcohol consumption  as well  are known risk factors for infective endocarditis  as they damage the valvular endothelium  predisposing it to infection. Diabetes might further compound the risk due to associated immune dysfunction.  The above demographic details align with literature findings indicating that infective endocarditis is most common in older adults and is more likely to affect men. Caucasians are also more commonly affected  and underlying heart disease is a major risk factor. Therefore  this patient's age  gender  race  and medical history confirm these findings.  Remember: The diagnostic process for infective endocarditis would typically include blood cultures  EKG  and echocardiography to identify any valvular vegetations or abscesses. It’s crucial to initiate a patient-centered management approach  incorporating antibiotic therapy  and potentially surgical intervention  depending on the severity of valvular damage.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,43,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis - A Case Presentation  Patient Information: Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient named Mr. X  a retiree  living in an urban area in the Midwest region of the United States. Mr. X is a smoker and was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus fifteen years ago. Mr. X has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. X was admitted to the hospital reporting 3 weeks of progressive malaise  night sweats  and weight loss. His spouse noticed intermittent confusion over the previous few days. His symptoms had been accompanied by a high-grade fever  reaching up to 38.5°C.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and was treated for prostate cancer successfully five years ago. His family history is significant for heart disease.   Review of Systems: Significant for fatigue  fever  unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and the new-onset cognitive decline as mentioned above. No chest pain  shortness of breath  or cough was reported.  Physical Examination: Mr. X appeared lethargic but fully oriented. His temperature was 38 °C  blood pressure was 145/85 mm Hg  pulse 85 beats/minute  and respiration 20 breaths/minute. Auscultation of the heart revealed a new systolic murmur at the cardiac apex. There were no signs of congestive heart failure  and no splinter hemorrhages  Osler's nodes  or Janeway lesions. Neurological examination found no obvious deficits.  Impression: The patient's condition  especially his prolonged fever  new-onset cardiac murmur  and clinical signs and history place him at high risk for infective endocarditis  potentially caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus viridans  the most common causative organisms in native-valve infective endocarditis.  Final Thoughts: Further investigative studies including blood cultures  echocardiography  and perhaps imaging studies to rule out metastatic infection should be considered. In the interim  it would be prudent to initiate empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected endocarditis. With this high index of suspicion and the patient's high-risk status for adverse outcomes  early diagnosis and treatment are critical.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,44,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Good Afternoon    Today  we'll be discussing a case of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). Our patient  Mr. L  is a 50-year-old male of European descent. NVIE is seen commonly in middle-aged and older adults  with a slight preponderance in men and in individuals of Caucasian ethnicity.  Mr. L works in construction and leads an active lifestyle. He's a non-smoker and occasional weekend drinker. He has no illicit drug use history – an important point to note  as intravenous drug use is a known risk factor for infective endocarditis.  Bringing our attention to his past medical history  Mr. L was diagnosed with bicuspid aortic valve disease 12 years ago. This congenital heart disorder leads to the development of aortic stenosis  making him more prone to NVIE. However  he's been managing his condition well with regular check-ups and adherence to treatment protocols. Mr. L is also hypertensive  on pharmacological therapy for the last 10 years.  Up until 2 weeks ago  Mr. L enjoyed good health and had no complaints. However  he has recently started experiencing symptoms like fever  malaise  night sweats  and weight loss. On detailed examination  signs like Osler’s nodes  Janeway’s lesions  and a new murmur were noted. These symptoms and signs point towards a possible diagnosis of NVIE - a serious condition which could lead to detrimental sequalae.  In conclusion  Mr. L's demographics of being a middle-aged  Caucasian male  coupled with his pre-existing heart disease  places him at a higher risk for the development of NVIE. Understanding the demographics of NVIE is crucial to identify at-risk patients and provide timely  accurate treatment. The heterogeneous nature of this disease requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and prompt intervention to improve prognosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,45,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information:   Mr. John Black is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. He is from a suburban community and lives with his wife. He is a retired engineer with a lifetime of history of non-smoking and limited alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Black presents with generalized weakness  fever  and loss of appetite for the past two weeks. He notes a weight loss of approximately 5 pounds over this period. He also reports experiencing night sweats and a new onset of a low-grade fever for a similar duration. Upon initial evaluation  he also mentions an ongoing dull ache in his back that he had neglected.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Black has a history of Hypertension which has been under control with Hydrochlorothiazide for the past 5 years. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications 10 years ago. He also has Hyperlipidemia treated with statins for the past 3 years. He has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  The patient is married and has three grown children. He denies smoking  drug use  and reports alcohol consumption as social  limited to an occasional glass of wine. He is not sexually active with anyone outside his marriage and has no travel history or exposure to infectious diseases.  Family History:   Mr. Black has a family history of premature coronary artery disease. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at 62 years  and his mother has chronic hypertension. His elder brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at age 57.  Clinical Evaluation:  On physical examination  a new murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation suggestive of likely valvular disease. He has a blood pressure reading of 150/90  pulse 88  temperature 100.3F  the aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures have been taken. This presentation along with the patient’s history suggests possible Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Further Investigation:  Further echocardiographic examination and other tests are advised to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.  DISCLAIMER: This data is based on representative demographics analyses for patients with this condition. Actual demographics and patient history can vary case by case.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,46,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female Patient: A Case Presentation  Slide 1:  Introduction  Native valve endocarditis (NVE) is an infection of the heart’s endocardial surface  occurring among both genders and all age groups. Globally  the male to female ratio ranges from 1.5:1 to 2:1. The median age at diagnosis is about 60 years.   Slide 2: Patient Information  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian woman named Mrs. Smith. She presents to the clinic with complaints of fever  night sweats  fatigue  anorexia  and weight loss persisting for four weeks.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension  managed with medication for the past 10 years  and had a transient ischemic attack two years ago without any residual deficits. She has no prior history of intravenous drug use  dental procedures  or recent invasive medical procedure.   Slide 4:  Epidemiology NVE predominantly affects people with a background of degenerative valve disease and mitral valve prolapse  notably in older adults. Several community-based studies have noticed an increasing trend in NVE among elderly patients  mainly due to the increased prevalence of degenerative heart diseases in this population.  Slide 5: Risk Factors for NVE  Risk factors for NVE include older age  male sex  intravenous drug use  previous history of infective endocarditis  and the presence of certain heart defects or damaged heart valves.   Slide 6:  Current Presentation The patient presents with classic symptoms and signs of infective endocarditis  including fever  heart murmur  and peripheral signs such as Janeway lesions (painless red spots on the soles and palms) and Osler nodes (painful bumps under the skin).  Slide 7:  Conclusion: Due to her age  background of heart disease  and the presence of consistent clinical features  a presumptive diagnosis of NVE is considered for Mrs. Smith. Further diagnostic evaluation  consisting of blood cultures and echocardiogram  is suggested to confirm the diagnosis  and prompt management with appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended to prevent any adverse outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,47,Title: Presentation of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Male   Slide 1: Introduction  Our patient today is Mr. John  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in the urban area of New York City. He is a retired school teacher  living with his wife and two dogs.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mr. John has a surgical history of dental procedures. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ten years ago and is on oral hypoglycemics. He is also being managed for Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia for the past 7 years. He has a known case of Mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation for which he has been regularly taking Propranolol for the last 5 years. Mr. John is a former smoker and admits to moderate alcohol consumption.  Slide 3: Current Symptoms  Our patient started to have intermittent low-grade fever  generalized body malaise  fatigue  mild weight loss  and occasional night sweats for the last 6 weeks. Recently  he noticed red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet  which he didn't pay much heed to initially but now are becoming quite pervasive and concerning.  Slide 4: Clinical Evaluation  Upon examination  besides the noted symptoms  we also noticed Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on palms and soles  slight splenomegaly  and a changing heart murmur.  Slide 5: Diagnosis  Considering his symptomatology  examination findings  and the presence of a predisposing valvular condition  Mr. John has been diagnosed with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Slide 6: Conclusion  Treating this patient would involve eradication of the infectious agent and addressing the structural damage caused to the heart. The comorbid factors  like hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  pose further challenges to his management. Therefore  multidisciplinary management is required to improve Mr. John's health status and prognosis.   Slide 7: References  Citations from recent clinical research and textbooks will be displayed here. This will establish the patient's narrative as in line with epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infective endocarditis worldwide.   Slide 8: Questions  The audience is welcomed to ask questions regarding the case during this segment of the presentation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,48,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: Mr. S is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  consistent with the fact that infective endocarditis often affects older male populations.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. S presents with a two-week history of fatigue  low-grade fevers  night sweats and unintentional weight loss. He also reports experiencing a recent episode of dizziness.   Past Medical History:  Mr. S has a history of diabetes and chronic heart disease but maintains a relatively active lifestyle. He has a history of smoking  with about 20 pack years. He has no known drug allergies and his immunizations are up to date. Mr. S has not had any surgeries in the past  and there is no known family history of congenital heart disease or other inherited cardiac conditions.   Recent history:  Mr. S reports a dental procedure about three weeks ago where he had a tooth extraction. He did not take any prophylactic antibiotics during that procedure.  Physical Examination: Mr. S is afebrile with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  pulse 85 bpm  and BMI 26 kg/m2. He has a new systolic murmur in his cardiac exam  splenomegaly is noted on abdominal examination  and petechiae are scattered throughout his lower extremities.   Assessment: The age  gender  and underlying health condition of Mr. S  along with his classical symptoms and recent dental procedure fits into the typical demographic and clinical presentation for native-valve infective endocarditis. Older males with pre-existing heart disease undergoing a non-cardiac procedure such as dental extraction are at greater risk for endocarditis.  Given this compelling history and physical exam  it is prudent that Mr. S undergo further diagnostic workup for suspected native-valve infective endocarditis. This should include blood cultures  complete blood count  inflammatory markers like ESR/CRP  and an echocardiogram to look for vegetations on his heart valves.   The combination of a past medical history of heart disease  lack of prophylactic antibiotics during dental procedure  alongside his present symptomology and physical examination findings  suggest a probable diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,49,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Introduction:  Past medical history and demographical data are essential determinants of a disease condition. They are particularly important for a condition such as native-valve infective endocarditis  which depends on factors such as age  gender  underlying medical conditions  and cultural and behavioral patterns.  Patient Presentation:  Today's case involves a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis. A resident of the northeastern United States  he lives in an urban low-income neighborhood. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history and a social drinker  consuming about two drinks per week as per his report.  Past Medical and Family History:  The patient has a past medical history of mitral valve prolapse and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been controlled under oral antidiabetic agents. He also reports hypertension  controlled with a beta-blocking agent. There is no known history of intravenous drug use. His father died of a myocardial infarction at 76 years of age  and his mother is alive and well at 85  has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is not aware of any inherited genetic disorders in his family.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of intermittent fevers  malaise  and an unexplained weight loss of about 10 pounds. He also recently noted dark-colored urine  and he has become increasingly short of breath over the past week  particularly when lying flat.  Conclusion:  Combining demographic data with past medical history creates a comprehensive picture of this patient’s risk of developing infective endocarditis and how the course of the disease may unfold. This patient’s age  gender  geographic location  social history  past medical history of valvular heart disease  and poorly controlled diabetes all place him in a relatively high-risk category. It is crucial for healthcare providers to appreciate the intersection of these socio-demographic dynamics when managing such cases  in order to ensure the most effective treatment. Further evaluation would include blood cultures and a transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,50,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: Patient Presentation   Patient Demographics and Medical History:   Ms. Smith is a 66-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis. According to available epidemiological data  individuals above the age of 60  particularly males  have a higher incidence of this disease  but it is by no means exclusive to this age group or sex  as demonstrated by Ms. Smith's situation. Moreover  Caucasians are found to be affected more frequently than other racial groups. Ms. Smith was born and currently resides in the United States  another known region with higher rates of this condition.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a significant past medical history that includes well-managed type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which she takes metformin and lisinopril respectively. She had a dental procedure performed two weeks prior to the onset of present symptoms  which may be a potential source of infection. She also has a history of intravenous drug use in her early twenties but has been clean for over four decades now. There is no indication or history of any immunocompromising condition.  Presenting Symptoms:  Ms. Smith reports recent onset of fatigue  intermittent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. She also mentions a new heart murmur that was noted during a routine checkup post her dental procedure along with occasional dyspnea. No signs of peripheral embolism were observable at presentation. A preliminary physical examination has indicated potential early heart failure  and a vegetation was suspected on her native mitral valve from an echocardiography.   Conclusion:  Based on the findings from the physical examination and her medical history  Ms. Smith's presentation is consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis; though further diagnostic testing such as blood cultures would be needed for a definitive diagnosis and to identify the causative organism. This will also help guide the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. She falls into the high-risk category due to her age and previous history of intravenous drug use  even though it was decades ago. Furthermore  the recent dental procedure may have provided an entry point for the bacterial infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,51,Title: A Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  who has visited the emergency department (ED) with complaints of fever  chills  and fatigue.   Address: He lives in rural Michigan and is previously engaged as a farmer raising pigs and poultry with no family history of significant heart diseases.   Presenting Complaints: For the past 2 weeks  the patient has been experiencing intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  and occasional night sweats. He has also noticed some unintentional weight loss over this period.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of untreated dental caries and gingivitis. There is no known history of intravenous drug use  indwelling catheters  or dialysis. He also suffers from moderate to severe gingivitis and has a history of poor dental hygiene over the years. However  he has no known heart diseases.   Demographic Representation: The chosen demographics align with literature on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). Certain epidemiological trends show that endocarditis is notably higher in males and increasing age  with the median onset age being approximately 50 years old--our patient being 60 years old is consistent with this literature. Mission-native valve infective endocarditis is predominant in Caucasians and is often associated with poor dental hygiene - another demographic characteristic of our patient. Farming (specifically animal farming) has been associated with zoonotic transmission of certain species of bacteria capable of causing NVIE. Hence  this case gives an accurate representation of a patient at a heightened risk of developing NVIE  based on epidemiological literature.   Physical Examination: On examination  the patient showed signs of splinter hemorrhages under his nails. His conjunctiva was pale  and a heart murmur was detected upon auscultation.  Further diagnostic tests are being conducted to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's age  gender  geographical location  farming occupation  and poor dental hygiene all work in concordance to fit the typical demographic of a patient at risk for NVIE  as per the existing literature.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,52,Slide 1:  Title: A Case of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 2:  Title: Demographic Information Patient X is an adult male  aged 63 years  Caucasian  around the median age range that has the highest prevalence of infective endocarditis in the general population. He resides in a suburban area and has been retired for the last 3 years with a history of labour-intensive work and no recent international travel.  Slide 3: Title: Lifestyle Patient X is a former smoker with a past history of smoking around 20 cigarettes a day for approximately 30 years. He quit about 7 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol primarily on social occasions.  Slide 4:  Title: Past Medical History Patient X has a history of rheumatic fever in his early 20s. Additionally  he has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus treated with metformin and glyburide. He underwent a cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to chronic cholecystitis. There is no noted history of intravenous drug use or significant dental procedures in the previous months.  Slide 5: Title: Presenting Complaint Patient X has been experiencing high-grade intermittent fevers  chills  shortness of breath  nocturnal sweats  and generalized fatigue for the past 3 weeks. He first attributed them to a viral syndrome  but with complaints of progressive dyspnea on exertion and recently noticing weight loss  he decided to seek medical attention.  Slide 6: Title: Infective Endocarditis Considering the combination of his present symptoms  a diagnosis of infective endocarditis is suspected. The past history of rheumatic fever and the presence of known risk factors such as advanced age  male sex  and diabetes further augment the suspicion. This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of infective endocarditis in elderly patients with predisposing heart disease or systemic risk factors presenting with unexplained symptoms.  Slide 7: Title: Next Steps Patient X will now undergo comprehensive investigations including blood cultures  echocardiography  chest radiology  and kidney function tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess for potential complications. Treatment will involve a prolonged course of antibiotics  potentially surgical intervention if indicated  and management of underlying conditions and risk factors.  Slide 8: Title: Conclusion Timely diagnosis and intervention in infective endocarditis cases crucial to prevent potentially fatal complications  given its predisposition to cause severe valve damage and systemic embolization. Patient X's case is a reminder of the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in at-risk individuals.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,53,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Mr. Brown is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who resides in an urban region in the Northeastern United States. He reports being a lifelong non-smoker with a moderate alcohol drinking history. His occupation involves administration work which is predominantly sedentary.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has had a history of occasional hypertension and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) hypercholesterol condition which has been managed with medication for the last 10 years. The patient reported that he suffers from intermittent episodes of dental infections and gum diseases leading to frequent dental procedures. He does not have a history of any open surgeries or intravenous drug use.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Brown presented to our clinic complaining of progressively worsening fatigue and breathlessness over the last three weeks. Additionally  he reports experiencing bouts of intermittent low-grade fever  excessive night sweats  and unexplained weight loss in this same time span.   Preliminary Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Brown appeared fatigued and exhibited signs of mild pallor. Cardiac auscultation revealed a changing cardiac murmur. Small non-painful  erythematous lesions were observed under his fingernails signifying Osler nodes  alongside Janeway lesions (non-tender hemorrhagic lesions) on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. His oral assessment showed poor dentition with some sign of recent dental procedures.   Diagnosis: Combining the presenting symptoms  physical findings  and patient's history of heart disease and poor oral hygiene  a provisional diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected.  Note: The profile of this patient is generally consistent with most reported cases of infective endocarditis  as the condition is most common in Caucasian males over the age of 50 with existing heart conditions. Poor oral health and dental procedures contribute to a higher risk for this condition.   The characteristics and symptoms reported here  and in broader literature  vary and a full investigation would be required for a definitive diagnosis  potentially involving a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) or blood culture tests. Immediate treatment would potentially involve antibiotics  with the potential for surgical intervention if antibiotic treatment is unsuccessful. Medical management should also prompt an evaluation of the need for prophylactic measures during any future dental procedures.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,54,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Geriatric Patient  Patient Profile: - Age: 70 years - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retiree  - Ethinicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint:  Intermittent fever and fatigue for the past two weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic heart disease  specifically  aortic regurgitation. He had an aortic valve repair operation 10 years ago and he is on Bisoprolol and Metformin for his underlying medical conditions. He also maintains an aspirin regimen due to his diagnosis of myocardial infarction approximately five years ago. He does not have any known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears chronically ill  weak  and slightly pale. His vital signs are: temperature 38.2°C  blood pressure 130/80mmHg  pulse 90 beats per minute  clean oral hygiene  a systolic murmur is noted. No Osler’s nodes or Janeway’s lesions were observed.   Laboratory Findings: Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were elevated  suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory process.   Considering the patient's history  physical examination  and laboratory findings  and the fact that he might exhibit a late onset of infective endocarditis following his aortic valve repair  the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Admission Status: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Department for a more comprehensive examination and appropriate management.  In conclusion  this case highlights a patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis in the setting of past aortic valve repair. The diagnosis was based on the patient's history of aortic valve repair  symptoms of persistent low-grade fever  fatigue  findings of a heart murmur  and positive blood cultures for Streptococcus viridans.  References: According to the literature  infective endocarditis is more common in older adults (>60 years) and more frequent in males. Also  patients with a history of heart disease and valve surgery are at a higher risk of developing infective endocarditis. In native-valve infective endocarditis  Streptococcus spp. is the common causative agent. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. M.S. is a 64-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the hospital with fever  fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and a new murmur identified on cardiac auscultation. Mr. M.S. reports that his symptoms began approximately three weeks ago  progressively worsening. He was previously in his usual state of health until the onset of symptoms.  Biographical Data:  Mr. M.S. is retired and used to work as an engineer in a renowned firm. He resides in a suburban area with his wife. He is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He denies illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of Hypertension  well controlled with Losartan 50mg daily. He also has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  managed with Metformin 500mg twice daily. Mr. M.S does not have any known drug allergies.   Pharmacological History:  Beyond the medications mentioned above  Mr. M.S. is also on a daily Aspirin regimen (81mg) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease  recommended by his internist based on his age and co-morbidities.   Social History:  He disclosed having poor dental hygiene with several missing teeth and has not seen a dentist in over two years due to fear of dental procedures. He reports a history of dental infections and self-treating with leftover antibiotic medications until the tooth pain subsides.   Differential Diagnosis:  Given his presenting symptoms  lack of immunizations  and history of poor dental hygiene  it has been concluded that Mr. M.S. is likely suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans are primary infectious concerns considering his history of untreated dental infections. Diagnostic examinations  including blood cultures and an echocardiography  are arranged see to confirm the diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,56,Title: Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Introduction: Patient X is a 59-year-old African American male  currently a smoker with a 20-year pack history  and a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This demographic group has a higher predilection for native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE)  as shown by recent studies. The patient also reports a history of intravenous drug use in his 20s and 30s.  Presenting Complaint: Patient X presents with a 2-week history of general fatigue  intermittent fevers  night sweats  and recent unexplained weight loss. His job as a long-distance truck driver makes it difficult for him to maintain a consistent care regimen for diabetes  increasing the risk for opportunistic infections.  Medical History: In addition to type 2 diabetes  the patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are well-managed with prescribed medications. His other previous medical history includes untreated dental caries and dental abscesses.   More concerning is his history of intravenous drug use  which further increases his risk for NVIE. Although he has been clean for over two decades  his past drug use  along with poor dental hygiene and control of diabetes  could contribute to the vegetation and bacteremia often seen in NVIE. He denies any history of heart murmurs  valvular heart diseases  or congenital heart diseases.  Family History: His mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus and died of myocardial infarction in her late 60s. His father had hypertension and died in his 80s from stroke.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  Patient X shows signs of mild distress due to discomfort. He has dental caries which suggest a potential source of bacteria seeding. Inspection shows osler nodes present on the pads of his fingers. Auscultation reveals a systolic murmur heard best at the apex  radiating to the axilla  increasing the suspicion of possible endocarditis.  In conclusion  given the patient's presenting symptoms  medical history of diabetes  untreated dental infections  and past intravenous drug use  he is a classical case of native-valve infective endocarditis which accounts for about 60-70% of all cases of infective endocarditis according to current literature. Further diagnostic measures such as blood cultures and echocardiography need to be conducted to confirm this diagnosis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy  dental care  and potential surgical intervention should be considered depending on the severity of the disease and patient's clinical response. Initiation of behavioral and lifestyle changes is also required to manage NVIE effectively.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,57,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Patient's Profile: Our patient – Mr. M  is a 64-year-old Caucasian male with a case of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).   Past Medical History: Historically  Mr. M has been fairly healthy with no significant medical concerns. He doesn't have a history of illicit drug use  which is often associated with IE. However  he has a past medical history of mild hypertension  for which he has been taking amlodipine.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. M was admitted with complaints of intermittent fever  a three-week history of fatigue  mild weight loss  and night sweats. He also reported experiencing a new heart murmur that wasn't present before.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. M appeared mildly pale. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg  and he was noticed to have a mild temperature (38.2 °C). In addition to this  an auscultatory examination revealed the presence of a new murmur suggestive of valvular heart disease.  Laboratory Findings: Lab tests showed an increase in the white blood cell count (12 000 per microliter) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 60 mm/hr. Blood cultures were also drawn after suspicion of IE which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus - which is one of the most common bacteria causing native valve IE.   Diagnosis Implication: Given the clinical findings in addition to his positive blood cultures  Mr. M was diagnosed with definite infective endocarditis based on the modified Duke criteria. The next step would involve determining the best treatment for him  which would likely involve a combination of antibiotic therapy  possibly with the addition of surgical intervention if it's established that there is severe valve damage.  Conclusion: This case presentation exemplifies the classic presentation of a native-valve infective endocarditis patient. It should be noted that IE is often a diagnosis of exclusion and should be suspected in febrile patients with a new murmur who have no other easily identifiable source of infection because early detection and treatment usually leads to better outcomes. With appropriate therapy  Mr. M’s prognosis should be relatively good  although his clinical progress should be closely monitored.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,58,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Good day  everyone. Today I'm going to present a case scenario of a patient presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart that typically arises from bacterial infection.  The patient being presented is Mr. John Smith  an African-American male who resides in an urban area. Mr. Smith is 57 years old  falls into the age group where the incidence of infective endocarditis is substantially higher. He is currently unemployed and lives alone.  Mr. Smith has a medical history of intravenous drug use  a recognized risk factor for infective endocarditis  which he reported ceasing approximately 15 years ago. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus seven years ago and hypertension five years ago  which he manages with anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications  respectively.  Mr. Smith sought medical attention due to experiencing persistent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past three weeks. He also mentioned intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath. On physical examination  a previously undescribed heart murmur was audible.   For past few years  Mr. Smith suffered from poor dental health with multiple untreated dental caries and poor oral hygiene  adding to his risk factors for infective endocarditis.   His BMI was within the normal range indicating an absence of obesity. There was no history of hereditary diseases or cancers within his family. Furthermore  he quit smoking ten years ago and reports being sober for the past fifteen years with sporadic alcohol use.  In conclusion  as per the demographics and the medical history  Mr. Smith's lifestyle and medical conditions like intravenous drug use  diabetes  hypertension  and poor dental health contribute largely to his risk factor profile that leading to a case of possible native-valve infective endocarditis. Further examinations and tests would be required to confirm the diagnosis  ascertain the extent of the infection  and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,59,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Samuel Miller Age: 62 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Marital status: Married Insurance: Medicare  Demographics: Native-valve infective endocarditis often affects males  aged between 60 to 70 years  accounting for 60% of the cases  predominantly of Caucasian ethnicity. Mr. Miller's profile aligns with this demographic.  Past Medical History: Mr. Miller was previously diagnosed with aortic sclerosis 8 years ago. He has a consistent history of bicuspid aortic valve disease. Apart from this  he has been managing hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 for the past 15 years. Also  note that he has no history of substance abuse. The prevalence of infective endocarditis in patients with underlying heart valve abnormalities  hypertension  and diabetes type 2  like Mr. Miller  has been well documented in literature.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Miller reports a two-week history of persistent high-grade fever and malaise. He has also reported a loss of appetite and shortness of breath  especially with exertion. These clinical manifestations like fever  malaise  anorexia  and shortness of breath are consistent with infective endocarditis.  Examination: On examination  he appears acutely ill. The physical examination showed presence of Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on his palms and soles and petechiae on his conjunctiva  all suggestive of infective endocarditis. Cardiac auscultation identified a new regurgitant murmur.  Investigations: Blood cultures were taken  and he is awaiting an echocardiogram examination. Blood culture is the gold standard and the key diagnostic tool for identifying the causative organism of infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram would help establish the existence of vegetations on the heart valves or endocardium  confirming the diagnosis.  Treatment Plan: Pending the blood culture and echocardiogram results  Mr. Miller has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy as per treatment guidelines for suspected native-valve infective endocarditis.  This presentation reflects the average statistics for this type of patient  but individual cases may differ. Timely diagnosis and management are key to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,60,Subject: Patient Presentation - Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Profile: The patient is a 50-years old Caucasian male  Mr. ABC  working as an IT specialist. There are no known drug or alcohol dependencies. He is a non-smoker and has a body mass index (BMI) of 24.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. ABC has been experiencing persistent  low-grade fever for the last two weeks. He also describes a sudden loss of appetite  fatigue  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. He has also reported multiple reddish spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet  which eventually progressed into painful nodules.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of mild and controlled hypertension for which he has been on lisinopril for the past five years. He had a congenital bicuspid aortic valve but had not required any interventions or surgery for such until this point. Mr. ABC has no known allergies.  Potential Diagnosis: Given his symptoms and pre-existing cardiac abnormality  Mr. ABC is suspected of native-valve infective endocarditis. His physiological symptoms of fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss are all flag signs for infective endocarditis. Additionally  the painful skin changes on his palms and soles are characteristic of Janeway lesions and Osler nodes which correlate with endocarditis.  Epidemiological Evidence: The demographic and clinical description of the patient matches epidemiological studies of infective endocarditis. The literature shows a peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades of life  particularly in men. Caucasians represent a significant proportion of these patients. While changes in the epidemiology of infective endocarditis have occurred with modern therapies and interventions  certain conditions such as hypertensive disorder and valvular heart disease (in this case  a bicuspid aortic valve) continue to stand as prominent risk factors in its development.  To confirm the diagnosis  blood cultures  full blood count  renal function test  and echocardiography will be requested. Depending on the diagnostic findings  an appropriate treatment plan will be formulated for Mr. ABC  which could include a course of antibiotics  heart valve repair  replacement  or surgery.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,61,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present Mr. Alvaro Rodriguez  a 35-year-old Hispanic male with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Personal History: Mr. Rodriguez has been experiencing persistent  low-grade fevers for the past two weeks  accompanied by fatigue  night sweats  and dyspnea on exertion. He also reported recent unexplained weight loss  and upon physical examination  a new systolic murmur was noticed.   Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has a past medical history of intravenous drug use. His last use was about a month ago. He also had two episodes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 5 years ago  which were treated successfully with antibiotics. He is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. Additionally  he has no known allergies to drugs or substances.  Epidemiological Data: Mr. Rodriguez's profile is not inconsistent with trends seen in literature; the male:female ratio for infective endocarditis is about 2:1  with the median age reported in many studies ranging from around 30-50 years. Intravenous drug use is a prominent risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis  most commonly involving the tricuspid valve because of the right-sided blood flow from venous circulation. Staphylococcus aureus  as previously reported in his history  is the most common causative organism involved.  Social History: Mr. Rodriguez is an automobile mechanic by profession with an average socio-economic status. He lives with his wife and two daughters in an urban area.   The clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis in Mr. Rodriguez has been elevated due to his prior medical history of intravenous drug use  recent signs and symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis such as fever  murmur  and weight loss  as well as past incidents of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Further investigation and appropriate management will be required.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,62,Slide 1: Title: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 55-Year-Old Male  Slide 2: Introduction: Our patient Mr. James  a 55-year-old African American male  presented at the emergency department with symptoms consistent with suspected native valve infective endocarditis. Previous literature suggests that infective endocarditis has a higher prevalence among males  emphasising the significance of this presentation.   Slide 3: Chief Complaint: He complained of persistent fever  significant weight loss  night sweats  and fatigue all occurring within the past three weeks.  Slide 4: Medical History: Mr. James has a known history of Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)  which is one of the most common heart valve anomalies and a well-recognized risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis. In addition  the patient has a 10-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with metformin.  Slide 5: Social History: Mr. James is a retired construction worker  he is a nonsmoker  and denies any use of intravenous drugs. However  he has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Slide 6: Examination: On physical examination  Mr. James was febrile  and a new heart murmur was detected which was not present in previous medical records. Multiple Janeway lesions were found on the palms and soles  and Osler's nodes were identified on his fingers.  Slide 7: Investigations: His blood cultures came back positive for endocarditis  confirming our suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram was ordered to identify any vegetations.  Slide 8: Conclusion: Infective endocarditis is a serious infection of the heart valves and should be considered in patients with risk factors such as heart valve disease and diabetes presenting with related symptoms. Early diagnosis and appropriate management is crucial. We anticipate to discuss Mr. James' treatment plan and prognosis in our upcoming care team meeting. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,63,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Presentation  Patient Profile: Mr. James Evans  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents today with recurrent fever  fatigue  weight loss and night sweats that he has been experiencing over the last few weeks. He is a non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer in moderate amounts. According to his occupational history  he works as a construction contractor  which exposes him to various environmental conditions.   Past Medical History: Mr. Evans has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which he monitors and manages closely with his primary care physician. His medication regimen includes Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes and Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension which he confirms he has been taking regularly. He has no history of illicit drug use or immunosuppressive conditions. Moreover  he has no known drug allergies.   Recent Medical Investigation: Approximately two weeks ago  Mr. Evans consulted his doctor for persistent tiredness  fevers  and unexplained weight loss. He was treated for flu-like symptoms with no improvement. He was noted to have a new murmur on the recent examination and has now been referred for further evaluation on suspicion of infective endocarditis.  Epidemiological Considerations: Endocarditis largely affects men (particularly older men)  with Mr. Evans' demographic group (age 60) being at a high risk  as highlighted by several studies. The incidence in men is nearly twice as high as in women  and patients with diabetes  just like Mr. Evans  may face an increased risk of acquiring the disease. Moreover  his job as a construction contractor might expose him to a spectrum of bacteria although no direct link with endocarditis has been established.  Clinical Presentation: Mr. Evans' persistent symptoms over weeks  including a new murmur on auscultation and his elevated risk factors warrants a strong suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. This diagnosis will be confirmed with further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography.   We will proceed with necessary interventions and pharmacotherapy based on the confirmatory results to prevent further complications like heart failure  embolic events and preserving the functionality of his valves.      Patient Consent: Mr. Evans has been informed about the possible diagnosis  the need for further investigations  and the potential treatment options available. He has given his consent and is cooperative with the management plan.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,64,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE): A Case Presentation  We'd like to present a case of a patient showing symptoms associated with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).   The patient is presented as Mr. Charles  a 60-year-old African American male from a less urbanized area. He has a history in construction work and enjoys hobbies such as fishing. Epidemiological studies indicate a higher prevalence of NVIE among older adult males and among people with lack of access to immediate healthcare due to living in less urban areas.   Mr. Charles came in complaining of persistent fever  malaise  and loss of appetite over the past two weeks  which he initially perceived as flu. He also reports a new  unexplained weight loss. The fever was noted to be low-grade at first  but has since progressively increased. He also mentions night sweats and has noticed small  reddish or purplish spots on his skin  specifically on his lower limbs and feet.  His past medical history is notable for untreated dental caries  intravenous drug use in his younger years  and occasional alcohol consumption. He admits to not visiting any healthcare providers in years  exhibiting a common issue among the demographic of less frequent healthcare access.   Mr. Charles suffers from long-standing rheumatic heart disease  resulting in a previously diagnosed mild to moderate mitral valve regurgitation  but was not surgically corrected due to lack of symptoms and patient's decision. The longstanding damage to the mitral heart valve predisposes him to increased risk of NVIE.  Furthermore  the existence of untreated dental caries indicates the possibility of a portal of entry for bacteria  as oral hygiene conditions can be correlated with the condition. The history of intravenous drug use intensifies the risk of bacterial pathway into the bloodstream  leading to infection of the previously damaged heart valve.  In conclusion  Mr. Charles's age  gender  socioeconomic status  lack of frequent and regular healthcare visits  underlying dental issues  history of drug use  and existing mitral valve regurgitation contribute to his risk and presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,65,Patient Presentation:  We present a case of Mr. Rodriguez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male patient who originally hails from Mexico but has spent a significant portion of his life in the United States. He has a sizeable history of medical conditions  which include type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and chronic kidney disease (Stage 3).   Mr. Rodriguez has not been previously diagnosed with any cardiac diseases. However  he presents with new onset of a heart murmur  palpitations  intermittent fever  and fatigue for approximately two weeks. Moreover  he also complains of dyspnea on exertion. There are no prior cardiovascular complications in his past medical history.   He is a nonsmoker and doesn’t consume alcohol. But he has a fondness for a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet due to his cultural influence  which has contributed to his persistent struggle with weight management and inadequate control of type 2 diabetes mellitus.   His family history reveals that his father passed away from complications of hypertension  and his mother was diagnosed with diabetes  which she managed well until her death due to unrelated causes. His work history includes long  stressful hours as a manager at a local restaurant  and his social history is noticeable for a rather inactive lifestyle due to his demanding job.  The patient adheres to his diabetes and hypertension medications. However  he has had a history of non-compliance with dietary and lifestyle modifications recommended for his medical conditions.  Given Mr. Rodriguez's new cardiovascular symptoms  his advanced age  his history of conditions predisposing to endothelial damage such as diabetes and hypertension  and his Hispanic ethnicity which has been associated with a higher risk of infective endocarditis in some studies  the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered. Further cardiology consult and investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and guide the management plan.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,66,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Presentation  Introduction: Infective endocarditis is a severe infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  which typically affects the heart valves. It is predominantly a disease found in older adults. Native valve endocarditis  which occurs in heart valves that haven't been replaced  is slightly more common in males.  Patient Presentation:  Mr. X is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who has been admitted to the hospital with a 2-week history of fatigue  night sweats  low-grade fever  loss of appetite  and weight loss. Mr. X stated that he initially noticed these symptoms approximately three weeks ago  which have steadily worsened. He has previously been a robust individual  so these symptoms significantly decreased his quality of life.  Medical History:  Mr. X has a history of mild heart valve disease (mitral valve regurgitation). He has been regularly monitored via echocardiogram every two years with stable findings. He was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which he manages with oral hypoglycemic agents.   Mr. X has a 10-year history of hypertension controlled with ACE inhibitors. He has no known allergies. He quit smoking 15 years ago  drinks alcohol occasionally. He reports leading a generally active lifestyle before the onset of his current symptoms.  Given his presentation and past history  he has been evaluated for infective endocarditis. We have recommended blood cultures and an Echocardiogram to confirm this suspicion.  In summary:  With his history of pre-existing heart valve disease and the noticeable signs of infection  Mr. X is a typical representation of the demographic commonly affected by native valve infective endocarditis. The life-threatening nature of this condition necessitates early diagnosis and prompt treatment. His already compromised heart  in addition to his age and underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension  make him more vulnerable. Hence  he will require critical management to improve his prognosis.  This case illustrates the importance of recognizing symptoms early and evaluating appropriately  especially in older male individuals with underlying heart valve disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,67,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis - A Case Report  Patient Demographic Information:  We present the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a demographic consistent with epidemiological data that suggests people of this age group and ethnicity are commonly affected by infective endocarditis. Though the condition can affect both sexes  studies indicate it slightly favors men over women.   Presenting Symptoms and Medical History:  The patient reported a six-week history of constant  generalized fatigue and intermittent nocturnal sweats. He also mentioned a loss of weight and appetite. Over the past week  he started experiencing chills and high fevers that peaked at 39.5 °C (103.1 °F). On closer examination  splinter hemorrhages were evident under his nails  an indication of possible subacute endocarditis.   The patient’s medical history revealed a diagnosis of moderate rheumatoid arthritis but no known heart diseases. He is on Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis. He doesn't have any history of intravenous drug use  neither did he have any recent dental procedures nor invasive procedures or surgeries. However  rheumatic diseases  such as the patient’s rheumatoid arthritis  are established risk factors for native valve infective endocarditis.   The preliminary diagnosis based on history and physical examination was native-valve infective endocarditis. Proposed investigations included a complete blood count  blood cultures  immunologic studies and an echocardiogram.  Epidemiological Factors:  This case is consistent with the idea that native valve infective endocarditis predominantly affects individuals over the age of 50  and is more common among those with pre-existing cardiac or immune-mediated conditions. Although the disease is rare  it has significant morbidity and mortality rates  which further underscores the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management.    Given this case of native valve infective endocarditis  accurate diagnosis and treatment are vital to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. As healthcare providers  we are reminded of the importance of thorough patient assessment and differential diagnoses in managing complex illnesses.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,68,Title: A case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  with a past medical history significant for intravenous drug abuse  smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily  lives in a metropolitan city  and works as a construction worker.  History and Examination:  The patient's primary complaint is a 2-week history of generalized malaise  constant dull pain in the chest  shortness of breath mainly on activity  and loss of appetite. He also reports fever  chills  and night sweats for the same duration. He admits to recent recreational drug use  without clean needle practice and was last hospitalized 10 years ago for a similar condition.  On examination  he is afebrile but appears chronically ill. He has a diastolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border  and splenomegaly on palpation of the abdomen. Petechiae are noted on his conjunctivae and auscultation reveals crepitations at the lower lung fields on both sides.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of IV drug use and had native valve endocarditis ten years ago treated successfully with IV antibiotics. He also has a 25-year history of smoking  and progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has not received any vaccinations  including pneumovax and influenza  due to his fear of needles. He denies any other known medical conditions. He has never married and lives alone.   This clinical scenario is representative of an at-risk population in terms of demographics as suggested in published literature. Native-valve infective endocarditis often affects individuals aged 30-60 years  with a higher predominance in males. Known risk factors for endocarditis include intravenous drug use  a previous history of endocarditis  and structural heart disease. The choice of patient's career also is significant as construction workers are known for an increased risk of dust and particle inhalation  contributing to his COPD history and potentially exacerbating his current situation.   Conclusion:  This patient represents a classic case of native-valve infective endocarditis likely due to his ongoing IV drug use  highlighting the critical importance of addressing underlying risk factors in the management of this condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,69,Presentation:  Patient Information:  We have JS  a 62-year old African American male  retired teacher  nonsmoker  moderate alcohol consumption  and lives in an urban setup with his wife. His family history reveals that his father died of cardiac complications at an early age  and his mother has diabetes and hypertension.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus that is well-maintained with oral hypoglycemics and diet control. In addition  he has been diagnosed with hypertension  controlled with lisinopril 10mg. He had a medical event of a mild myocardial infarction about 8 years back and was managed medically. His lipid profile and renal function tests are normally within the specified range. He has no known allergies. He also has mild obesity with a BMI of 30.5 and has been advised weight management strategies.   Presenting Complaint:  JS presented to the emergency department with complaints of 1 week of subjective fever  weakness  fatigue  and some episodes of night sweats. He also has a low-grade  constant pain in his chest that he assumed to be because of his known cardiac history  which has recently been associated with shortness of breath and light-headedness. As a recent development  he also reports noticing skin spots and unintentional weight loss.   Based on the available information  the clinical suspicion is towards native-valve infective endocarditis. However  further in-depth diagnostic investigations like blood cultures  echocardiography among others  are required to confirm the diagnosis and plan the treatment approach. This would be followed by a treatment course involving antimicrobial medications and monitoring  with a consideration of surgical intervention if necessary.   This presentation corresponds to reports indicating that endocarditis is more common in men than women  and the average age of diagnosis tends to be in the late 50s to early 60s. Our patient's risk factors include his previous myocardial infarction  obesity  hypertension  and diabetes. A careful  individualized therapeutic approach is crucial in managing this patient's condition given his age and comorbidities. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,70,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Description  Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 58 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Military Officer Residence: Southern California  United States  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presents with a one-month history of intermittent low-grade fever  fatigue  unintended weight loss and night sweats  all indicating vague and non-specific symptoms associated with infective endocarditis. Recently  he has started to experience increasing shortness of breath  especially during mild exertions.  Medical History: When it comes to his previous medical history  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  well-managed with Metformin. He also has a history of moderate hypertension for about a decade  which is being controlled with Lisinopril  a moderate daily exercise regimen  and a low-salt diet. Notably  an echocardiogram conducted 2 years ago indicated early signs of mitral valve regurgitation  which has been under observation since then without significant progression.  Social History: His social history reveals significant smoking for 30 years (about 1 pack/day) but he quitted 3 years ago. He doesn't report any illicit drug utilization and is a moderate drinker. He lives with his wife and they have no pets. He reports no recent travel or any contact with sick individuals.  Family History: Mr. Johnson's father and elder brother both have histories of cardiovascular disease. His father had a heart attack at the age of 65  and his elder brother underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 62. There is no family history of heart valve diseases or rheumatic fever.  Discussion: Given his robust military background  the patient’s comorbid conditions (diabetes  hypertension  and early stage mitral regurgitation) and his presenting symptoms  there is a substantial likelihood that Mr. Johnson may have developed native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection instigated by bacteria entering the bloodstream and settling in the heart's native valves. His shortness of breath may be indicating a progression of his heart condition  and it is crucial to seek immediate attention. Considering his medical history and presenting symptoms  early diagnosis and prompt treatment would be critical for preventing complications  including heart failure and disseminated infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,71,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Caucasian Male   Demographic Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  retired  and living with his wife. He is originally from the Northeastern United States but has recently relocated to Florida. He occasionally smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol socially. The patient has a moderate-income level  having retired from a managerial role in a large company. He is independent in activities of daily living.  Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2  controlled with metformin  and mild hypertension managed with ace inhibitors. He has a history of Stage I Colorectal Cancer  treated with surgery and chemotherapy with no sign of recurrence. His father had a myocardial infarction and died at the age of 64. The patient completed his last tetanus and influenza vaccination within the year. He has a known allergy to penicillin that causes a rash.  Presentation: The patient was brought to the emergency department presenting with a fever that has persistently fluctuated over 38 degrees Celsius  fatigue  difficulty breathing  noticeable weight loss over the past month  and a persistent cough. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new heart murmur which had not been previously documented. Blood cultures were drawn and a transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered which showed the presence of vegetation on the native heart valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.  This presentation reflects the typical demographic of infective endocarditis patients  who are more often male (2:1 male-to-female ratio) and middle-aged or older. The occurrence in the florida state area is due to higher rates of IV drug use  as well as lower access to primary care and higher rates of underlying cardiovascular disease. The patient's past history of diabetes mellitus and colorectal cancer indicates a generally compromised immune system which could contribute to this condition. The presence of a heart murmur  fever  fatigue  and weight loss are all classic symptoms  while the echocardiogram finding of valve vegetation is a key diagnostic criterion for infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,72,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith  who presents with a 2-week history of persistent fever  night sweats  weight loss  and general malaise. He is a retired construction worker who is a 20-pack-a-year smoker and reports occasional alcohol use. He has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) but has reportedly been clean for the past five years. He reports no travels and no other known exposure to infectious diseases.  In terms of his past medical history  Mr. Smith has a history of untreated dental caries and periodontal disease. He was diagnosed with Hepatitis C  likely secondary to his IVDU history  and is currently undergoing antiviral therapy for the same. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with Hypertension five years ago and is on medication since then. Mr. Smith has no known allergies to any medications and has no other significant family history.  About six months ago  Mr. Smith was treated for an episode of cellulitis and has been on intermittent antibiotics for the recurrent skin infections believed to be secondary to Hepatitis C. He has never had a surgical intervention.  The demographics and medical history of this patient indicate an increased risk of developing native valve infective endocarditis. Several risk factors like age  a history of IVDU and Hepatitis C  coupled with poor dental health make the patient susceptible to infections. Even though the patient reported no recent travels  infectious endocarditis is not directly tied to travel or geographic location. The presentation of fever  night sweats  weight loss  and malaise is consistent with systemic symptoms observed in infective endocarditis.  In summary  Mr. Smith's demographic and medical history makes an initial suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis plausible. However  further diagnostic evaluations  including blood cultures and echocardiograms  will be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,73,Slide 1: Introduction Patient X  a 60-year-old caucasian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use  uncontrolled Type II diabetes  and periodontal disease  presents with symptoms consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 2: Demographics According to literature  infective endocarditis has a male predominance and is typically seen in patients aged 30 to 60. Our patient falls squarely within this range. Furthermore  Caucasians have been reported to be more susceptible  though incidence in other races remains significant.  Slide 3: Relevant Medical History - Intravenous Drug Use: Patient X reports a history of intravenous drug use  a well-known risk factor for infective endocarditis due to frequent injection that provides potential entry points for bacteria into the bloodstream.  - Type II Diabetes: Patient X's uncontrolled diabetes may be associated with an increased risk due to poor vascular health and longer healing times for wounds.  - Periodontal Disease: Poor oral health  such as the patient's periodontal disease  is a recognized source of bacteremia  increasing the risk for infective endocarditis. Regular flossing and dental check-ups are encouraged.  Slide 4: Current Presentation  Patient X presents today with symptoms of fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  and a new heart murmur that were observed for the past two weeks. These signs and symptoms are clinically consistent with infective endocarditis albeit nonspecific.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Next Steps Further assessment is needed for diagnosis confirmation of native valve endocarditis. This will include blood cultures and an echocardiogram. Additional treatment will be guided by the etiology and susceptibility profile of the organism and may necessitate prolonged antibiotic therapy. Recommendations will also extend to management of his diabetes and periodontal condition to reduce future risk.  
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,74,Presentation Title: An Overview of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Introduction: Today  I'd like to present a case of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  considering that the condition most notably affects those between the ages of 50 and 70 and is intended to be more common in men than women. The patient is unmarried  lives alone  and has a history of intravenous drug use  a well-documented risk factor for infective endocarditis.  Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history which includes type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The patient is known to have poor control over his blood sugar levels and blood pressure  despite prescribed medications. He comes from a low socio-economic background  with limited access to regular and comprehensive healthcare due to lack of insurance.   He has previously been admitted to hospital for pneumonia and has undergone treatment for hepatitis C  presumably from his intravenous drug use. His dental health is poor with signs of untreated dental caries which can act as a source of bacterial inoculum leading to infective endocarditis. The patient does not have any history of rheumatic heart disease but reports frequent episodes of unexplained fever during the past year.   Recent Clinical Presentation: In the recent admission  the patient presented to the Emergency Department with high-grade fever  weight loss  night sweats  and fatigue. He has been experiencing these symptoms for a few weeks but did not consider them serious. During the examination  Osborne's sign  and Janeway lesions were noticed  both indicative of infective endocarditis. A foster murmur was heard on auscultation which was not previously documented and there was evidence of mild splenomegaly.  Investigations have been initiated including blood cultures and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis.   In Conclusion: This case features a typical presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis in a high-risk patient due to intravenous drug use  poor dental health  and the existence of underlying co-morbidities. This highlights the criticality of early recognition of symptoms and prompt  targeted treatment to optimize patient outcomes. The ongoing management will include long-term antimicrobial therapy and addressing the underlying risk factors.

However  its incidence may vary based on geographical region and access to healthcare services.)  - Occupation: Plumber  Slide 3: Medical History  Title: Past Medical History  - Diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease in teenage years  - Moderate aortic valve insufficiency  - Hyperlipidemia  - Mild Hypertension  - Discontinued intravenous drug use 20 years ago  Slide 4: Current Presentation  Title: Symptom Profile   - New onset heart murmurs detected during recent check-up  - Persistent  low-grade fever for the past 3 weeks  - Decreased appetite  - Unintentional weight loss  - General fatigue  - Chills and night sweats  Slide 5: Initial Diagnosis and Investigation  Title: Suspected Disease & Tests  - Based on symptoms  medical history  and physical examination  suspected diagnosis: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  - Tests ordered: Blood cultures  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)  CBC  ESR  CRP  Slide 6: Literature Insights  Title: Endocarditis & Demographics According to literature  males are more likely to develop infective endocarditis with a ratio of 1.7:1 (male:female)  and the disease is commonly found among individuals aged 30-60 years. The association with past intravenous drug use  existence of aortic valve insufficiency  and the patient's age group align well with the typical demographic representation.  (Note: Please remember that this is a general presentation and the risk factors  presentation  and demographics can differ between populations and patients  and not all patients will present in the same way.)
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,76,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Presentation   Patient Presentation:  Mr. Douglas is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  with a history of tobacco use and diagnosed with bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement due to severe aortic stenosis 2 years ago. He presents today with a two-week history of intermittent fever  general malaise  shortness of breath  and unexplained weight loss. He denies any recent dental procedures or intravenous drug use.   Demographics:  Statistically  native valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is predominantly seen between age 50 and 70 years  and is more common in men. According to the literature  Caucasian patients  like Mr. Douglas  have the highest incidence of NVIE among different races.   Past Medical History:  In addition to his aortic stenosis  Mr. Douglas has a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent coronary artery stent placement 5 years ago  due to ischemic heart disease. He has had an array of pharmacological treatments related to his various conditions  including metformin  ramipril  and simvastatin. He has a 45-pack year history of smoking but has not cut down significantly after his coronary artery disease diagnosis.   Analysis:  Mr. Douglas's profile fits with those most likely affected by NVIE. His past medical history puts him at increased risk  given the long-standing heart disease  presence of the bioprosthetic aortic valve  and poor general health status due to diabetes  COPD  and tobacco use. All these comorbidities further elevate his risk of developing NVIE.   Given the prolonged febrile illness and his past medical history  a suspicion of NVIE is reasonable in this case. Further investigations  including echocardiograms and multiple blood cultures  are advisable to ascertain the diagnosis.  References:  1. Cahill TJ  Baddour LM  Habib G  et al.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,77,Title: A Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I. Patient Information Our patient  referred to as Mr. White for confidentiality  is a 63-year-old Caucasian male from an urban town in the Midwest. He's a retired construction worker  currently living with his wife  and has a history of occasional alcohol use. No known drug abuse or tobacco use was reported.  II. Medical History Mr. White has a significant medical history  including a diagnosis of Type-II Diabetes  which he has managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications for the past ten years. Other significant diagnoses include hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively. He has no previous history of valvular disorders or previous valve replacement  nor does he have any known allergies to medications.  III. Present Illness Mr. White presented with a two-week history of intermittent fevers  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  and a new heart murmur detected during initial physical examination. The heart murmur is consistent with native-valve endocarditis. A peripheral blood culture tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus  making infective endocarditis more likely.  Concurrently  he complained of weakness in the left side of his body coupled with difficulty speaking and understanding  indicative of a neurological event possibly linked to embolic phenomena secondary to endocarditis.  IV. Diagnosis and Management Based on his clinical signs and symptoms  positive blood cultures  presence of a new heart murmur  and the evidence of neurological involvement  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.   Mr. White was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy based on his blood culture sensitivity results. A transesophageal echocardiogram was ordered to visualize the heart valves and chambers and confirm the diagnosis. This is essential as the patient is at high risk of complications including stroke  heart failure  and other systemic embolisms due to his condition. Further management will be determined by the results of these tests and consultations with cardiology  infectious diseases  and possibly neurology teams.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,79,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Introduction  Meet Mr. John Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with several weeks of feeling unwell  characterized by fever  general weakness  abnormal weight loss  and night sweats. Mr. Johnson was a resident of San Francisco and worked as a marine engineer before his retirement. He's married  a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol only occasionally. As a veteran  he has medical insurance coverage.  Teeth and Oral Care  Mr. Johnson hasn't been to a dentist in five years due to fear and neglect. He has a history of poor oral hygiene and has several untreated cavities. It is highly likely that the native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) originated from his untreated oral infectious foci.  DM and Cardiac History  Mr. Johnson has been managing type II diabetes for the past fifteen years. He's been on metformin and currently has good glycemic control. He has a ten-year history of hypertension controlled by lisinopril and atenolol  and also a three-year history of asymptomatic ischemic heart disease.  The interplay of his comorbidities such as diabetes and ischemic heart disease with poor oral hygiene puts him at increased risk of developing NVIE.  Relevant Lifestyle Factors   He enjoys occasional fishing and boat rides with his friends  which might indirectly increase his exposure to certain microorganisms. Mr. Johnson has no history of IV drug use  and has no tattoos or piercings.  Current Symptoms   He came to the emergency department complaining primarily of fever of unknown origin  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. On physical examination  there are signs of peripheral embolism  including splinter hemorrhages  Janeway lesions on palms and soles  and Osler's nodes. Heart examination reveals a new murmur  suggestive of valve involvement.  With the triad of fever  new heart murmur  and peripheral manifestations of endocarditis  he was immediately admitted to the hospital and blood cultures were drawn. He's now on empiric antibiotics while awaiting the definitive diagnosis.  Conclusion   Mr. Johnson's case indicates that the demographic shift in endocarditis incidence over recent years is real  with the disease increasingly affecting older males with long-standing comorbidities. It underlines the need for proactive preventative measures such as routine dental care and general health check-ups  particularly in those with established risk factors for endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,80,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Caucasian Male with Diabetes Mellitus  Demographics: The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male who works as a welder. He lives in rural Pennsylvania and is of a middle class socioeconomic status. He is a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history. He has a history of intravenous drug use  which he quit 20 years ago. The patient does not consume alcohol and has no known allergies. He lives with his wife and two adult children.  Past Medical History: The patient has a ten-year history of poorly controlled Type II diabetes mellitus and has been non-compliant with prescribed oral hypoglycemic medications. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease  dating back 5 years and managed conservatively up to date. There is no known family history of cardiovascular or infectious diseases. The patient had a severe skin infection 4 years ago that required intravenous antibiotics  likely associated with a MRSA infection in his lower left leg.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient presented with a 2-week history of low-grade fever  unexplained weight loss  and generalized malaise. He reported experiencing night sweats  an increasingly persistent dry cough  and occasional chest discomfort over that same period.   Based on these symptoms  our working diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis  likely originating from the poor glycemic control or the past history of skin infection. Further investigation  including an echocardiogram and blood cultures  are needed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism.  Representation in Literature: According to literature  the typical patient diagnosed with infective endocarditis (IE) is male (70%) of a median age of 58 years. Caucasians represent 78.2% of IE cases in the United States. Diabetes is a well-documented risk factor for IE  as is a history of smoking and previous valvular or other heart diseases. Native valve IE is typically seen in patients with risk factors like immunosuppression  insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  or the elderly. Intravenous drug use is a significant historical risk factor associated with native valve IE.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,81,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Presentation: Mr. John Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a two-week history of persistent fever  nocturnal sweats  and unintentional weight loss. Born and residing in upstate New York  Mr. Smith has a history of smoking  specifically a 20 pack-year smoking history  but quit 10 years ago. His alcohol consumption is moderate  at 1-2 drinks per week. He has a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation as an administrative manager. He has a known hypertensive disease  diagnosed seven years ago  and high cholesterol  diagnosed three years ago  both of which are managed with antihypertensive and antilipemic drugs  respectively.   His past medical history includes a diagnosis of dental caries  for which he underwent dental extraction two months ago. He also has a history of gout treated with colchicine. He does not have a known history of intravenous drug use  heart valve disease  or rheumatic heart disease. Genetic history indicates his father died at 67 of a myocardial infarction  and his mother is still alive at 88 with Alzheimer's disease.   His current ailments started with fatigue following the recent dental extraction but then progressed into persistent fever and night sweats. A recent development was the appearance of small  painful nodules on the pads of his fingers and toes. He also reports mild occasional chest discomfort without any specific pattern or activity associated with it. He denies shortness of breath  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.    Due to these signs and symptoms and given his recent dental procedure  a suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis might be considered. Based on the IDC-10 diagnostic procedure  Mr. Smith's case appears to accord with the I33.0 code  signifying Acute and subacute infective endocarditis. Further investigations and echocardiographic studies will be carried out to finalize the diagnosis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy will be initiated if the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis is confirmed.   The aim of presenting this case is to highlight the importance of considering infective endocarditis among older adults presenting with non-specific symptoms such as persistent fever and weight loss  specifically following invasive procedures  like dental extractions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,82,"Slide 1: Introduction  Title: A Case Presentation of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. Professionally  he is retired and has a history of intravenous drug use  specifically he reported using intravenous heroin approximately 20 years ago. He lives with his elderly mother and has a supportive community around him. His sexual history reported to be heterosexual  nonsmoker  and he denies regular alcohol consumption.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   The patient has a known past medical history of uncontrolled Type-2 diabetes mellitus  moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and congestive heart failure. He has had a dental abscess 2 months ago which was treated with oral antibiotics. The patient has a known allergy to penicillin. He underwent a rheumatic heart disease surgery in his 30s.  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation  The patient complains of intermittent fever  night sweats  fatigue  mild shortness of breath  and weight loss occurring over the past three weeks. Upon examination  he is febrile with temperature of 38.5 C  heart rate of 102 beats/minute  and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. A heart murmur was noted on cardiovascular system examination.  Slide 5: Conclusion  Given the patient’s symptoms and signs  a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis is suspected. The presence of predisposing factors such as his past intravenous drug use  dental infection  and rheumatic heart disease surgery makes this increasingly likely. Further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiogram are now necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management.   Note: It is recognized that these demographic characteristics do not represent every patient with native valve infective endocarditis. The choice was made based on the most commonly affected population in literature. Other populations can equally be affected  making it crucial to maintain vigilance in assessing symptoms and risk factors.  Reference: Fowler  Vance G.  et al.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,83,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Patient is a 67 year-old Caucasian male presenting with complaints of fever  fatigue  shortness of breath  and night sweats persisting for the past month. He has medical history of poor dental health  specifically untreated dental caries  and chronic hypertension  for which he takes medication. The patient has a history of smoking  about a half pack per day for the past 40 years  but has no history of IV drug use or alcoholism.   Medical History: Past medical history includes chronic hypertension managed with Lisinopril  and hypercholesterolemia managed with Atorvastatin. The patient has not had any surgical procedures in the past. He did have a dental procedure about two months ago and has been complaining of toothache since then but has not sought further dental treatment.   Literature Review: According to the research  this patient profile regards a typical demographic for native valve infective endocarditis. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the average age for presentation of infective endocarditis was around 61 years. Despite the common belief that this condition is restricted to intravenous drug users  many research findings  including a study in PLOS ONE  have suggested poor dental health as a significant risk factor in non-IV drug users  as in the present case. Further  the European Heart Journal concludes from their study that males are more likely to acquire infective endocarditis than females.   This case's demographics indicate a need for early identification of infective endocarditis  given the presence of reliable risk factors: advanced age  male sex  poor oral health  and chronic heart disease. Prompt evaluation and management may help reduce the risk of severe complications such as heart failure or stroke.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,84,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the clinic with ongoing fatigue  intermittent fevers  night sweat  and unintentional weight loss. She also reports a recent change in the nature of a pre-existing heart murmur that was diagnosed incidentally two years ago.  Past Medical History:  In terms of her past medical history  she has been previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension which are being managed with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She has no history of IV drug abuse. Her family history includes Hypertensive Heart Disease on her father's side.   Recent Hospital Admission:  Patient had a dental procedure performed six weeks ago during which she received prophylactic antibiotic treatment. But soon after the procedure  she started to experience these vague symptoms of fatigue  low-grade fevers and dramatic weight loss.  Considering her age  ethnicity  gender  pre-existing heart murmur  and recent dental procedure leading to bacteremia  she is at a moderate risk for Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).   Statistics:  Since the incidence of Native Valve IE is increasing in people older than 60  and the disease distribution typically skewed towards Caucasians and males  this case is slightly less conventional but still maintains clinical relevance. Although males are more commonly affected  women comprise about one-third of patients with IE  which is significantly higher than previous decades and particularly notable in older age groups.   Her past medical history of Diabetes might contribute to her slightly elevated risk  especially if her glycemic control has been suboptimal. Likewise  Hypertension can contribute to endothelial damage  making her susceptible to bacterial invasion.  Thus  the patient's symptoms  medical history  and recent dental procedure  compounded by the change in her heart murmur  suggest a high suspicion for Native Valve IE  which necessitates immediate investigation and management to prevent severe complications like heart failure or systemic embolization.   In conclusion  her case epitomizes the growing incidence and changing epidemiology of Native Valve IE  highlighting the importance of considering this diagnosis in similar clinical scenarios.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,85,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the hospital complaining of persistent fever  malaise  night sweats  weight loss  and occasional breathlessness for the past few weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented past medical history of Stage II Heart Failure that was diagnosed four years ago. He has been prescribed medication and has been regularly following up with his cardiologist. Other comorbidities include type II diabetes and hypertension  both of which have been managed with oral hypoglycemic and anti-hypertensive medication respectively. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and is a moderate consumer of alcohol.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the patient was found to have a new systolic murmur  along with shortness of breath on exertion. His temperature was 38.6° C. Examination of his extremities revealed the presence of Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes  both classic signs of endocarditis. During his eye examination  Roth's spots were also noticed.  Diagnosis: Based on the presenting symptoms  namely persistent fever  new murmurs on auscultation  and various septic phenomena  along with the patient's previous history of heart failure  the suspicion of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE) was raised. Further laboratory tests and Echocardiographic findings will be required to confirm the diagnosis.  Demographics: NVIE has been observed regularly in older patients  often over 60 years old  and is more common among males in comparison to females  according to the literature. It has also been shown to be more dominant among the Caucasian population.  Associated Risks: Patient X's heart failure exacerbates his risk for NVIE. Furthermore  his history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension may negatively influence the prognosis and potentially increase the complication rate due to endocarditis.  In Conclusion: The patient's demographics  medical history  and current symptoms align with those often seen in cases of NVIE. However  further diagnostic tests must be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to guide subsequent therapeutic decisions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,86,Title: A Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 48-year-old Caucasian male  who is a known intravenous drug user  presenting to the hospital with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  chills  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss over the past two weeks. Associated symptoms include a new heart murmur and skin lesions that resemble petechiae and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a known significant history of injecting heroin for the past 15-20 years. He has been diagnosed with previous episodes of cellulitis and a history of Hepatitis C  likely attributed to his intravenous drug use. He denies any history of HIV or other immunocompromising conditions. He has no known allergies and is not currently on any medications.  The prevalence of infective endocarditis is higher in individuals with a history of intravenous drug use  like Mr. Smith. Furthermore  in recent literature  infective endocarditis affecting native valves have been associated more often with men and Caucasians have been overrepresented among patients. Moreover  the age group of 30-60 years has been shown to have the highest incidence.  In conclusion  Mr. Smith's demographic and past medical history put him at a high risk for native-valve infective endocarditis. His symptoms and signs further increase our suspicion of this potentially life-threatening condition. Immediate diagnostics to confirm the diagnosis and timely treatment initiation is crucial to prevent further cardiac damage and systemic complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,87,Title: A Case presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  as this demographics appears to be the most commonly affected by infective endocarditis according to the literature. His occupation is a farmer  a profession that places him at risk for exposure to potential infection-causing agents.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant medical history of intravenous drug use  dating back to his late 20s. Substance abuse is known to significantly increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis. Additionally  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in his early 50s. His diabetes is reasonably managed with Metformin  and he uses a corticosteroid inhaler for his COPD. Furthermore  there is a three-year history of untreated dental caries  a common predisposing factor for oral flora-related endocarditis.   Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at the age of 75  and his mother suffocates from chronic pulmonary diseases at the age of 68.   Social History:  The patient is a chronic heavy smoker  with a history of consuming one pack of cigarettes per day for the last 35 years. He admits to current alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. He lives alone in a rural area and has minimal social interaction.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presents with a two-week history of persistent  high-grade fever  rigors  night sweats  unintended weight loss  and generalized fatigue. Four days ago  he notices multiple small  painless red spots on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions). On closer examination  there are hemorrhagic lesions in the retina  known as Roth's spots.   Clinical diagnosis was confirmed to be Native Valve Infective Endocarditis using the Duke Criteria due to the presence of major criteria: positive blood cultures and evidence of endocardial involvement as indicated by the manifestation of Roth's spots and Janeway lesions.   In conclusion  this case stands as a reminder of the potential severity of infective endocarditis  particularly within high-risk populations such as intravenous drug users. It highlights the necessity for early diagnosis and appropriate management to prevent mortality and morbidity.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,88,Patient Presentation  Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a three-week history of fever  weight loss  and malaise. He also describes experiencing night sweats and mild chest pain  particularly on deep inspiration. His wife notes that he has become increasingly short of breath even with minimal activity.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been managed by oral medication for over a decade. Mr. Smith is a retired schoolteacher and denies any tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use. He admits to infrequent dental check-ups despite poor oral hygiene.  Upon physical examination  Mr. Smith appears chronically ill. His vital signs indicate a low-grade fever of 37.8°C and a heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new-onset heart murmur. Further examination of his skin exposes petechial lesions on his palms and soles.  Blood cultures have been taken and empiric antibiotic therapy considered in light of the suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. This correlates with Mr. Smith's demographic  which is found in literature as infective endocarditis patients commonly involve older adults  particularly male persons  with preexisting heart conditions. The presence of poor oral hygiene is also a known risk factor. The ongoing investigation includes an echocardiogram to identify any vegetations and to also assess the severity of the newly discovered heart murmurs.  Conclusion: The patient's clinical manifestation and demographic representation align with the typical patient profile for native-valve infective endocarditis. This case underlines the importance of regular dental check-ups  especially for individuals with co-morbidities  to prevent possible systemic infection that may result in serious complications  such as infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,89,Patient Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Moore  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  hails from an urban  middle-income demographic and is self-employed.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Moore presents with the chief complaint of ongoing intermittent fever for the past two weeks. He has also recently noted weight loss  fatigue  and night sweats.  Present Illness: Over the course of the aforementioned period  Mr. Moore states that he has been experiencing increased shortness of breath with mild day time activities. He also experiences mild chest discomfort  lightheadedness  and reports bouts of confusion recently. His fever has been low-grade but persistent  responding initially to over-the-counter antipyretics but returning within a few hours.  Past Medical History: Past medical history is notable for type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the last 10 years  both well controlled with metformin  lisinopril  and amlodipine. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack year history and quit smoking around 5 years ago.  Surgical History: Mr. Moore underwent appendectomy at age 22  and there were no post-operative complications noted.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and his mother had hypertension. His sister  age 58 has recently been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus.  Social History: Mr. Moore lives with his wife and has no children. He reports occasional alcohol consumption on social occasions only. He has not travelled recently and denies any known drug allergies or use of illicit drugs.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Moore appears fatigued and is in moderate distress due to dyspnea. His vital signs demonstrate a fever of 100.9°F  blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg  pulse rate at 100 BPM  and respiratory rate of 22 BPM. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur heard best at the apex.  This presentation is consistent with Native-valve infective endocarditis. However  confirmatory tests such as blood cultures  echocardiograms  or other forms of imaging may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.     References:   Baddour L  Wilson W  Bayer A  et al.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,90,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in Elderly Male Patient  Patient's Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  who presents with a two-week history of fever  fatigue  and shortness of breath. He hails from a semi-urban community in Florida  USA  and lives with his wife.   Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of rheumatic heart disease from his early twenties  for which he regularly takes prescribed medications. He was overweight  with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 (height: 6 feet; weight: 200 lbs)  but otherwise had been in good health until this time. He has been treated for hypertension for the last ten years and has been a non-smoker for more than thirty years.  Clinical Presentation: Upon examination  the patient appeared sick and fatigued. His vitals recorded at presentation showed a fever of 38.5°C  blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac exam revealed a new murmur suggestive of valvular abnormality.   Initial investigations showed signs of inflammation with an elevated white cell count of 14 000/mm³ (reference range: 4 000-11 000/mm³) and an unusually high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 80 mm/hr (reference range: 0-22 mm/hr)  indicative of an ongoing infectious process. Initial blood cultures are pending.  The patient's symptoms  signs on examination  and initial investigations suggest a diagnosis of infective endocarditis  affecting his native heart valves  most likely secondary to his history of rheumatic heart disease. Further diagnostic procedures  like an echocardiogram  along with consultation with an infectious disease specialist  have been ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.   Maintaining an awareness of the higher risk of infective endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart conditions  especially in older adults  is essential for early detection and prompt treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,91,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Patient is a 50-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe. Mr. Doe is a retail manager residing in Dayton  Ohio. He lives with his wife and two teenage children. He drinks socially and denies tobacco or drug use. Mr. Doe has a history of moderate physical activity and is slightly overweight with a BMI of 27. He reports having a balanced diet but has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both controlled with medication.  Past Medical History:  John Doe maintains regular follow-ups with his primary care physician and endocrinologist to manage his type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension. He has been on Metformin 500mg BD and Lisinopril 20mg daily. His last HbA1c was 7.1% and Blood pressure was 134/89 mmHg. He has no known allergies. Mr. Doe had a dental procedure approximately three weeks ago. He also maintains regular dental check-ups.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presented to the emergency department with a week-long history of low-grade fever  chills  malaise  and unexplained weight loss. On further questioning  he mentions experiencing night sweats and mild shortness of breath for the past few days. There is a faint rash on his lower limbs that he hadn’t noticed before. He denies any chest pain or cough.   Conclusion: Considering his recent dental procedure  persistent fever  possible septicemia symptoms  and new symptoms of heart failure like shortness of breath  an infective endocarditis of the native valve raises suspicion. Further investigations including blood culture  an echocardiogram  and potentially cardiac CT are warranted to confirm this suspicion and to plan out the best management strategies.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,92,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Male Patient   Patient Demographic Information: Our patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  who works as a construction worker. The patient is a smoker with a 30-pack year history and consumes alcohol socially. He does not report any illicit drug use. He has no known environmental allergens and no noted allergies to medications.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. He is on Metformin and Lisinopril for the same. The patient has no past surgical history and no family history of cardiac diseases.  Presenting symptoms: The patient was brought to the emergency department with complaints of high fever with chills  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and a new-onset heart murmur. The fever has been ongoing for around 3 weeks. He also noted an unintentional loss of weight and has been feeling excessively tired.   Examination: On physical examination  the patient has petechiae on his conjunctiva and a previously undocumented systolic murmur. His fingers exhibited signs of clubbing and Janeway lesions were noticed on the palms and soles.  Assessment: Considering the patient’s ongoing fever  new murmur  visible vascular phenomena  and risk factors such as diabetes  the initial suspicion is native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient’s occupational exposure to dust and particles as a construction worker may also contribute to the risk. More confirmatory tests including blood cultures and echocardiogram are recommended.   Disclaimer: This presentation has fictional elements for the demonstration of a typical case of native-valve infective endocarditis. In clinical practice  each patient will exhibit unique symptoms and risk factors.   References: 1. Murdoch DR  Corey GR  Hoen B  et al.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,93,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male  presenting to the hospital with complaints of persistent fatigue  persistent fever  chills  and a new cardiac murmur diagnosed by his general practitioner. He also expresses some discomfort in the chest area towards the heart. Patient reports unintentional weight loss over the past month but denied recent travel or IV drug use during his history collection.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a past medical history of congenital heart disease but no documented prior history of using injected drugs  HIV  or immunosuppressive disorders. He had a dental procedure performed several weeks ago but did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis. He has no known allergies and takes no regular medication.  Relevant Demographic Information:   Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) can affect individuals of all age groups but it commonly affects those aged around 30 to 60 years and is more prevalent in males. Literature suggests that Caucasians have a slightly increased risk of NVIE compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions like our patient  particularly chronic rheumatic heart disease  which is highly prevalent in this age group  can also increase the risk of NVIE. Dental procedures without appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis are known to provide a portal of entry for bacterial infection which often precedes the development of NVIE.  Making a clear and early diagnosis of NVIE in this patient is crucial  as this will inform appropriate treatment modalities and improve prognosis. Further diagnostic workup  including blood cultures  echocardiography  and complete CBC count  would be warranted.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,94,Patient Presentation  Patient Details: The patient is Mr. Johnson  a 60-year-old African American male with a Sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Issue: He has reported to the hospital complaining of persistent and recurrent fever over the past 3 weeks. He reports symptoms of generalized malaise and night sweats too. A physical examination revealed a heart murmur and the patient also had non-tender small erythematous lesions on the pads of his fingers and toes (Osler's nodes).  Medical History: Mr. Johnson is a smoker and has a past history of chronic hypertension  which has been managed by medication over the past ten years. His health history also includes Type II diabetes  diagnosed about 5 years ago. He has a family history of heart disease  with both parents having suffered from cardiovascular diseases. He has not had any surgeries in the past.   Social History: The patient lives alone and has recently retired from working as a plumber has infrequent visits from his two grown children. He consumes alcohol rarely and is observing a low salt diet for his hypertension.  On initial screening  he is found to be febrile  with a temperature of 38.6°C. Standard laboratory tests have been ordered and empirical therapy has been initiated. A blood culture has also been ordered.   Provisional Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  the presence of a heart murmur  Osler's nodes  and his risk factors of hypertension and diabetes  there is a high suspicion for Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. It may be due to the damage caused by the blood rushing past a valve in his heart  where germs have attached. Given that Mr. Johnson's career as a plumber might have exposed him to several bacteria  this assumption is plausible.  Further investigations: The diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis will be confirmed through laboratory examination of blood cultures. An echocardiogram may be ordered to provide an image of his heart to assess the suspected damage.  It is very crucial to note that immediate optimized treatment plan would be needed  should the diagnosis be confirmed to mitigate rapid disease progression and to stem resultant complications such as heart failure and systemic embolism.  Infective Endocarditis is a serious infection and can also lead to life-threatening complications. It is important for patients like Mr. Johnson  given his age and other underlying health conditions  to remain communicative about all the symptoms he experiences and be compliant with the treatment plan recommended by the healthcare team.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,95,Title of Presentation: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Caucasian Male   Introduction:  I would like to present a case of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). According to literature  the disease is more common in males and individuals over 50 years of age and this demographic information has been taken into account for this presentation.  Patient's Profile:  Our patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male from an urban area. He is married with one child and works in construction  a profession that is known to expose individuals to various environmental pathogens.  Past Medical History:  He was previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes approximately seven years ago and is currently managed with oral anti-diabetic medication. He has a history of cigarette smoking - a pack a day for 20 years  but quit 3 years ago. No known drug allergies are documented for this patient. There is no prior history of illicit drug use. Family history includes cardiovascular disease in his father who had a myocardial infarction at 65 years and sister with a congenital heart disease.  Presenting Condition:  The patient presented with a three-week history of unremitting fever  night sweats  weight loss  and increasing levels of fatigue. He reports having been generally healthy until this illness  although he has noticed occasional swelling in his feet and ankles over the past month.   As per the findings of Pettersson and Hussain (2016)  IE primarily affects individuals with existing heart conditions or those who use intravenous drugs  however  our patient was at risk due to his age  gender  and pre-existing condition of diabetes. This presentation is line with the documented findings in current literature. More diagnostic procedures are in progress to further ascertain the treatment protocol for the patient.   Conclusion:  Early identification of symptoms and diagnosis remains critical in managing IE  as it is a serious condition with potential for severe complications if left untreated. As healthcare providers  understanding the correlation between patient’s demographic details and risk factors  with potential medical conditions  is crucial to ensure accurate diagnosis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,96,Title: Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Presentation:  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a history of alcohol abuse  cigarette smoking  and periodontal disease. He was lately diagnosed with diabetes mellitus  which is inadequately controlled  and admitted three months ago for an acute myocardial infarction. His daily medications include aspirin  metoprolol  and metformin.  Chief Complaints: The patient complains of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  chills  and night sweats persisting for the past three weeks. He has recently developed exertional dyspnea  mild chest discomfort  and fatigue. He also reported an unintentional weight loss of 5 kg over the last 2 months.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  patient was febrile and appeared ill and tired. Auscultation of the heart revealed a diastolic murmur and signs of heart failure were present. Examination of the oral cavity revealed poor dental hygiene with evidence of periodontal disease. Ophthalmoscopic exam showed Roth spots.  Investigation & Diagnosis: A series of blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridians. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed showing vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with a diagnosis of Infective endocarditis (IE). Based on presentation  clinical findings  and investigations  patients has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis associated with diabetes mellitus  which probably predisposed him to this condition.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis typically affects males more often than females with a peak prevalence at age 60 or older. Co-existing conditions  notably including diabetes  increase the risk of infective endocarditis. The diagnosis usually involves identifying causative agents and conducting imaging studies to identify heart valve damage.  This patient's history of alcohol abuse  smoking  poor oral hygiene and poorly controlled diabetes  together with his recent diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction  has synergistically predisposed him to develop infective endocarditis. His demographics  clinical history  and presentation are consistent with epidemiological trends observed in native-valve IE patients. It is exceedingly important to identify such high-risk patients for early diagnosis and targeted management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,97,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Introduction:  Meet Mr. Jenkins  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presenting with fever  fatigue  and a new cardiac murmur. Mr. Jenkins has been in generally good health until a month ago when he started to experience persistent fever along with weight loss  loss of appetite  night sweats  and general malaise. His GP initially treated him for a suspected upper respiratory tract infection but his condition didn't improve.  Demographics:  Mr. Jenkins  from a middle-class socioeconomic background  lives with his wife in a suburban setting. He retired from his work in construction a few years ago but remains physically active. He is a former tobacco user but has not smoked in the past 5 years. He has a moderate alcohol intake– predominantly wine – and does not use any illicit drugs.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jenkins has a history of mitral valve prolapse diagnosed in his early 40s  for which he has remained asymptomatic throughout his life. Other relevant medical history includes hypertension  which has been well-controlled through medication  and mild hypercholesterolemia.  Presentation:  Upon physical examination  Mr. Jenkins is found to be febrile with a temperature of 38.2 degrees celsius. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new murmur  suggestive of possible valvular insufficiency. His blood pressure and resting heart rate readings are generally within normal limits  though they occasionally display mild fluctuation correlating with his fever peaks. Blood tests reveal increased inflammatory markers.   Conclusion:  Given his persisting fever  new murmur  and past medical history of valvular heart disease  a suspicion of infective endocarditis is raised. Further investigations  such as blood cultures and echocardiography  are needed to confirm this diagnosis. In the mean time  empirical antibiotic treatment is initiated until the definitive causative agent can be identified.   This presentation aligns with the demographic representation found in literature  stating that infective endocarditis primarily affects older adults with pre-existing valvular heart disease  and is more common in males. It also illustrates the atypical presentation of this disease  where symptoms develop gradually over a period of weeks. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,98,Patient Presentation:   John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department reporting general fatigue  loss of appetite  and unexplained weight loss for the past three weeks. He also mentions recurrent fever spiking up to 38.7°C and night sweats for the same duration. He denies any current chest pain  cough or shortness of breath  but states that he has been feeling increasingly weak and lightheaded lately.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of moderately controlled Diabetes Mellitus Type II for which he takes Metformin and occasional insulin. He also reports a history of Rheumatic fever in his childhood which left him with a mild aortic stenosis – a condition he has been monitoring regularly with his primary care physician. He quit smoking 5 years ago  following a mild myocardial infarction which was managed percutaneously with angioplasty and stenting to his coronaries. He has been on maintenance aspirin for this. He drinks a glass of wine occasionally but denies any illicit drug usage. He underwent a dental procedure one month back and was prescribed a single dose of prophylactic amoxicillin due to his known valvular heart disease. No allergies are reported.  Based on his signs and symptoms  past medical history and the recent invasive dental procedure  a suspected diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered. Research has shown that middle-aged and older adults  particularly men with a history of valvular heart disease  are at a higher risk for endocarditis.    Further diagnostic tests  including blood cultures for identifying causative organism and transthoracic or potential transesophageal echocardiography for visualization of valvular vegetation or abscesses would be necessary to confirm this provisional diagnosis.   Endocarditis is a serious disease  and without prompt diagnosis and treatment  the condition can lead to life-threatening complications. Therefore  the suspected diagnosis needs to be confirmed or ruled out swiftly for appropriate management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,99,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Slide 1: Introduction - Subject: Native-valve infective endocarditis - Importance: Increasing in incidence due to an aging population  rising intravenous drug use  and healthcare-associated procedures.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Name: Mr. A - Age: 59 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Plumber - Lives in urban area - Literature: Men are more prone to infective endocarditis. Prevalence increases with age  peaking in the 5th-6th decade of life.  Slide 3: Social History - Occasional smoker  - Moderate alcohol consumption  - No history of recreational drug usage  Slide 4: Medical History - Diagnosed with diabetes mellitus three years ago - History of mitral valve prolapse - Literature: Diabetes mellitus is a recognized risk factor. Heart valve abnormalities (such as moderal valve prolapse) predispose to infective endocarditis.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms - Fever and chills over the past 2 weeks - Night sweats - Shortness of breath - Weakness and fatigue - Literature: Symptoms are typically nonspecific and can vary based on the severity of the cases.  Slide 6: Physical Examination - Heart murmur detected - Janeway Lesions  - Clubbing noted - Literature: Murmurs are typically present  especially in cases involving diseased valves. Janeway lesions and clubbing are signs of infective endocarditis.   Slide 7: Investigations - Blood culture tests – positive for Staphylococcus aureus - Echocardiography: Vegetations on the mitral valve - Literature: Staphylococcus aureus is a common causal organism. Echocardiography is crucial to detect vegetations on heart valves.  Slide 8: Conclusion  - Considering the medical history  clinical symptoms  physical examination findings  and investigations  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is made. - A consult with a cardiology specialist would be needed for treatment planning. - Prompt management is crucial to prevent serious complications  such as heart failure and spread of infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,1,100,Title: Presentation of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile:  Mr. George Cooper is a 56-year-old Caucasian male presenting with concerns related to frequent fevers  night sweats  fatigue  and a newly detected heart murmur as characterized in native-valve infective endocarditis. Born and raised in rural Georgia  Mr. Cooper previously worked in agriculture until his recent retirement. He is a non-smoker but admits to consuming alcohol socially.  Past medical history:  Mr. Cooper's medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia  both of which have been managed through lifestyle modifications and medication for the past ten years. The patient has a documented allergy to penicillin  leading to a rash. There is no history of illicit drug use  and he has had no previous surgeries. He has not had any heart surgeries  previous endocarditis  or other cardiac conditions.  Recent history:  Mr. Cooper started experiencing unexplained fevers and significant fatigue about three weeks ago. He initially assumed it was a viral infection until the symptoms persisted. He also reports a weight loss of about ten pounds during this period. Over the last week  he has noticed increasing shortness of breath  especially on exertion. There are no gastrointestinal  urinary  or neurological symptoms.  Family history:  The patient's father had a myocardial infarction in his late sixties  and his mother has well-controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus. His older brother underwent a brain stent placement for an aneurysm a few years ago.  Clinical presentation:  On examination  Mr. Cooper appears fatigued. He has a low-grade fever and an irregular pulse. There are no visible skin lesions or petechiae. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new-onset systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Lungs are clear on auscultation  and abdominal examination is unremarkable.  Conclusion:  After a thorough review of Mr. Cooper’s profile  clinical presentation  and past medical history  there is a strong possibility of native valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic testing including blood cultures and an echocardiogram are warranted to confirm this diagnosis and guide the treatment accordingly.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,1,"Patient Information: Mr. Edward  a 60-year-old African-American mailman with a BMI of 28  living in an urban neighborhood  presents with general malaise  fatigue  and a persistent fever of 100.8°F.

History of Present Illness: Patient reports symptoms started gradually about two weeks ago  with increasing fatigue and intermittent fevers which are not responsive to over-the-counter remedies. He has also mentioned a weight loss of 8 pounds in the last month without any significant changes in his diet or activity routines.  Relevant PMH: Mr. Edward has a history of uncontrolled diabetes type II  which he manages with oral medications and dietary modifications  and hypertension controlled on medications. He also previously had a dental abscess treated three weeks ago.  Social History: He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially  approximately two times per week.  Review of systems: Patient also reports occasional night sweats  loss of appetite  and a new heart murmur noticed by primary care provider.  On examination  the patient appears in moderate distress. He displays pallor and has a couple of petechiae under his fingernails. His oral hygiene is poor. Cardiovascular exam elicits a new grade III systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. No other significant findings were noted.  Based on his history  age  racial background  presence of a new heart murmur  and recent dental procedures  Mr. Edward is suspected of having Native-valve Infective Endocarditis. Necessary lab tests and imaging studies have been ordered to confirm this diagnosis."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,2,A 65-year-old African-American male named John Smith presents the emergency department with a 10-day history of intermittent fevers  chills  and malaise. Mr. Smith has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and rheumatic heart disease. He has been in stable control of his DM and hypertension with a home regimen of Metformin and Losartan  respectively  and follows up regularly with his primary care physician.   A week ago  Mr. Smith visited an outpatient clinic with complaints of fatigue  myalgia with low grade fever  which was thought to be a viral syndrome. However  his condition deteriorated with persisting high-grade fevers  night sweats  and weight loss of around 5 kg in one month.   On examination  Mr. Smith had oral temperature of 38.4°C  blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg  heart rate of 100 beats/minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On cardiovascular examination  a diastolic murmur was heard on the left sternal border. Splinter hemorrhages were noted under his fingernails  and Janeway’s lesions were found on his palms and soles.   Considering his history of rheumatic heart disease and the positive findings from the physical examinations  a suspicion of infective endocarditis was made. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,3,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Martinez  a 60-year-old Hispanic woman  presents to the emergency department with a 10-day history of intermittent chills  fatigue  and shortness of breath. Over the past three days  she also reports experiencing night sweats and reduced appetite. She has a past medical history significant for poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  mitral valve prolapse  and intravenous drug use in her youth.  She denies any recent dental procedures  surgeries or indwelling catheters. On examination  she appears chronically ill and fatigued. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new regurgitant murmur over the mitral region. She also has non-blanching  erythematous nodules on the palms and soles  suggestive of Osler's nodes.  Diagnostics demonstrate elevated leukocyte count and a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus  indicating bacteremia. Echocardiography reveals mitral valve vegetations  which further supports a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 9.5% indicates poor diabetic control as a potential risk factor for her current condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,4,A 50-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of fever  general malaise  alternating sweats and chills  and unexplained weight loss. He also reports a new onset of shortness of breath and nocturnal cough.   The patient has a past medical history of intravenous drug use  for which he completed rehabilitation 10 years ago. He also has a history of untreated dental caries. The patient does not have any known cardiac history. His family history is noncontributory.   On physical examination  he appears fatigued and has a temperature of 101°F (38.3°C). Blood pressure and heart rate are stable. Auscultation of the heart reveals a new pansystolic murmur in the mitral valve area. On skin examination  he has two Janeway lesions on the palms of his hands and Osler nodes on his fingers. Oral exam shows multiple untreated dental cavities and poor oral hygiene.   Laboratory studies show elevated inflammatory markers  and blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on his mitral valve. He was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis secondary to IV drug-use and poor dental hygiene. He was admitted and started IV antibiotic treatment for endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,5,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Juan Martínez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  comes to the hospital expressing concern about high fever  weight loss  and profuse night sweats which has been worsening over the past one month. He reports experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and intermittent chest discomfort  associated with a racing heartbeat. The patient’s past medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and intravenous drug use in the past. He had a dental procedure performed about 6 weeks ago which he mentions was followed by a brief period of fever and discomfort but did not seek medical attention at that time.  He has a consistent history of poor dental hygiene as well  and upon oral examination a number of decayed teeth and bleeding  inflamed gums are evident  pointing towards chronic periodontitis. The patient is a current smoker and reports consumption of alcohol on a social basis. His family history is not significant for any cardiovascular disease.  On physical examination  Mr. Martínez is febrile with a temperature of 101.5F  a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg. Cardiac examination reveals a diastolic murmur at the apex and splinter hemorrhages under the nails are noticed. A blood culture is recommended by the attending physician and empirical antibiotic treatment is initiated in suspicion of possible native-valve endocarditis.   Comment: The patient’s age and ethnicity are consistent with epidemiological studies showing an increased frequency of infective endocarditis in males over the age of 60. Furthermore  his history of poor dental hygiene and a dental procedure make him susceptible to blood-borne bacterial infections that are well-known causes of endocarditis. His past of intravenous drug use and poorly managed diabetes are significant risk factors too.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,6,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  resident of a rural area  who presents to an outpatient facility with a one-month history of fever and chills followed by a recent onset of shortness of breath. He notes intermittent fever  as high as 39C  associated with profuse sweating  particularly at night. He has also reported a weight loss of 8 pounds in the past month  which he attributes to loss of appetite. He denies recent travel  alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drug use.  He has a history of moderate rheumatic heart disease  diagnosed in his early thirties after a bout of rheumatic fever  and managed per guidelines since then. He also has a known history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is generally well controlled with metformin  and hypertension managed by taking lisinopril.  Mr. J works as a livestock farmer and had an incident of a deep cut on his arm around 2 months back  which was treated at a local clinic. He also has a dental cleaning procedure a few weeks before the onset of the fever but denies any dental pain or discomfort since then.  On examination  he appears fatigued. He is febrile  with a body temperature of 38.4C. Examination of his cardiovascular system reveals a previously undocumented murmur which is described as a mid-systolic ejection murmur heard at the left sternal border.   This case presentation is of note  as infective endocarditis is common in males  particularly those over 60 years old with pre-existing heart conditions. Furthermore  the association between rural residence and livestock farming with infective endocarditis has been noted in the literature.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,7,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of generalized fatigue  fevers  and night sweats. His past medical history is significant for aortic stenosis which has been managed conservatively till now. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2  and he had a dental procedure performed approximately 3 weeks ago.   Upon examination  his vital signs are: temperature of 38.5°C  blood pressure of 125/85 mmHg  heart rate of 95 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination reveals a new pansystolic murmur at the right second intercostal space  clubbing of his fingers and toes  and small painless erythematous lesions on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions).  Initial blood investigations show elevated inflammatory markers with leukocytosis and raised ESR and CRP. Blood cultures have been obtained and sent to the laboratory. EKG shows no acute pathological changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram is ordered and shows vegetations on the aortic valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis. The patient has been started on empiric antibiotics awaiting definitive culture results.  Patient's history of aortic stenosis  recent dental procedure  and clinical presentation with a new heart murmur  Janeway lesions  and positive blood cultures are suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. The presentation is typical for the demographics  as native valve endocarditis more commonly affects male patients and those with prior heart conditions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,8,Patient Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Williams  presents to the office with complaints of continuous lower-grade fever for the past three weeks. His fever is accompanied by fatigue  mild weight loss  and occasional night sweats. He further mentions he has been feeling an unusual weakness while doing any physical activity. He denies any history of recent travel or sick contacts.   He is a retired construction worker  a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol socially. His BMI is within the normal range for his age and height.   Mr. Williams has a past medical history of type II diabetes  for which he takes metformin  and rheumatic fever in his early twenties. He used to have a dental procedure around two months ago.   On examination  he has a temperature elevation and a diastolic murmur on cardiac auscultation is noticed. Splinter hemorrhages are also seen under his fingernails. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Given his symptoms and physical examination findings  a suspicion of infective endocarditis is raised  particularly in light of a dental procedure that could have served as a source of bacteremia. Further investigations are planned to establish the diagnosis.   This patient presentation involves the common demographic (older Caucasian male)  risk factors (history of rheumatic fever  dental procedures  and diabetes mellitus)  and symptoms (fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  weakness  a diastolic murmur and splinter hemorrhages) associated with native-valve infective endocarditis as reported in literature.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,9,Patient Presentation   Mrs. Lois Jennings is a 65-year-old African American woman from rural Georgia  who comes to the clinic complaining of experiencing fatigue  low-grade fevers  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. She mentions these symptoms began with the onset of a mild flu-like syndrome that did not resolve. Recently  she also started to notice changes to her skin  including small  painless red or purple spots under the skin on her fingers or toes.   Mrs. Jennings has a history of rheumatic heart disease due to an untreated strep throat infection during childhood. She also has a long history of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes and was recently hospitalized for a dental abscess which had to be surgically drained.   She is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband. Mrs. Jennings mentions that she does not drink alcohol  smoke or use recreational drugs. She follows a diabetes-friendly diet but struggles with consistency due to personal preference and financial constraints. She has been inconsistent with her dental hygiene practices due to cost concerns around dental care. She is up-to-date on her recommended immunizations but is overdue for her regular dental check-up due to a fear of dental procedures.   The initial physical examination reveals a low-grade fever and a systolic murmur best heard over the apex. Skin examination reveals splinter hemorrhages under her nails and petechiae on her palms and soles. The exam also identifies Osler nodes (painful bumps on the fingers) and Janeway lesions (red spots on the palms and soles). Mrs. Jennings appears fatigued and reports feeling unusually weak.  Considering her clinical presentation and history  the working diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis  most likely from streptococci or staphylococci introduced during her recent dental abscess drainage. The next step would be to confirm the diagnosis with blood cultures and an echocardiogram.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,10,Patient Presentation: Mr. Carter  a 66-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  presents to the hospital with a four-week history of increasing fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He also reports a low-grade fever that has persisted despite self-management  and difficulty breathing during minor physical activities which was not present before.  Past Medical History: Mr. Carter is a smoker with a 30 pack year history. He has been managing hypertension and type 2 diabetes for 10 years  which are under control with medications. He has no known allergies to drugs. There is no prior history of intravenous drug abuse  surgeries  or dental procedures.  On physical examination  Mr. Carter appears chronically ill. His body mass index is 30. His blood pressure is 145/80 mmHg  heart rate 108 beats per minute and irregular  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and body temperature 38.1°C. Cardiac examination reveals a new cardiac murmur over the mitral area. Skin examination shows microhemorrhages on the palms and soles with small  pustule-like lesions.  Relevant diagnostic testing reveals anemia in complete blood count  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate  CRP and poor glycemic control in HbA1C levels. Chest X-ray shows a small pleural effusion while electrocardiogram presents atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Exceptionally  two sets of positive blood cultures grow Streptococcus viridans  leading to a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  The patient's age  pre-existing mitral valve disease due to hypertension  and poorly controlled diabetes are all identified as high risk factors that contributed to his development of endocarditis. This case is consistent with literature stating that infective endocarditis predominantly affects males over 60 with a history of diabetes or heart disease. His occupation did not add a significant risk  but his smoking history may have contributed to his overall poor health.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,11,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Gonzalez  a 62-year-old Hispanic female  presents to her primary care physician complaining of 3 weeks of fatigue  intermittent fever  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last month. She denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or cough. She reports a dental procedure 5 months ago but denies recent travel  IV drug use  or recent illnesses.   Her past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis for which she takes weekly methotrexate and prednisolone daily; diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled with metformin; and hypertension managed with lisinopril. She is a retired elementary school teacher  doesn't smoke or drink alcohol  and lives alone. Her family history is significant for heart disease in her father; both parents are now deceased.  Examination reveals a temperature of 100.2°F  blood pressure of 140/80  heart rate of 98 bpm and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. She appears malnourished. Cardiac examination shows regular rhythm and a new grade III/VI systolic  rough  blowing murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. Skin examination shows tender  small erythematous nodules on her fingers (Osler's nodes) and non-tender  small  flat  reddish-pink spots on the palms and soles (Janeway's lesions). She also has some peripheral edema.  Given Mrs. Gonzalez's symptoms  physical examination  and history  she is suspected of having native-valve infective endocarditis  likely due to poor oral hygiene and a recent dental procedure. This suspicion is heightened because of her weekly use of methotrexate and daily prednisolone  both of which can suppress immune response  and advanced age  which is a known risk factor for the disease. She will require blood cultures and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and start on appropriate antibiotic therapy as soon as possible.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,12,Patient Presentation:  Mr. David  a 60-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency room with a 2-week history of intermittent fevers  chills  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds. He also reports a new-onset of shortness of breath and occasional night sweats.  David has a significant past medical history of moderate-to-severe mitral valve regurgitation  for which surgery was deemed unnecessary at the time of diagnosis. He is a long-term smoker with a pack-year history of 20 years and has a reported history of intravenous drug use until about 15 years ago. He also has an established diagnosis of Type II Diabetes Mellitus but is relatively non-compliant with his medications.  On physical exam  he appears generally ill. There are splinter hemorrhages in his nails  and Osler's nodes were found on the pads of his fingers. A cardiac murmur  consistent with mitral regurgitation  is noted and seems to have increased in intensity since his last examination 6 months ago. Furthermore  Janeway lesions were observed on his palms and the soles of his feet.  Considering his background of underlying heart valve disease  and presentation including fever  weight loss  and classic clinical signs  a suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis is raised. Immediate blood cultures and an echocardiogram are ordered to confirm and for further management.  These symptoms  physical findings  and his past history coincide with his high risk for native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,13,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Hernandez  a 48-year-old Hispanic male accountant from San Antonio  presents at the outpatient department with complaints of persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats  and loss of appetite for the past 3 weeks.  He follows a vegetarian diet  doesn't consume alcohol or drugs  and denies any recent travels or unpasteurized dairy intake. He used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years but stopped smoking 5 years ago. His family history is notable for type 2 diabetes in his mother and hypertension in his father.  His past medical history is significant  with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 10 years which is controlled effectively with Metformin. 2 years ago  he was also diagnosed with moderate chronic kidney disease primarily managed by diet control and blood pressure control (Lisinopril). He also underwent a root canal procedure 4 weeks ago.  On physical examination  he appeared ill with a moderate size spleen palpable on deep inspiration. A new-onset pan systolic murmur was heard on auscultation  especially over the mitral region. Multiple tiny hemorrhagic spots were noticed under his fingernails (Splinter hemorrhages) and on the conjunctiva of his eyes.  Given his presentation and past medical history  there seems to be a strong clinical suspicion for native valve infective endocarditis. Further imaging (Echocardiography) and blood cultures have been ordered to confirm the diagnosis. The patient has been admitted to the hospital for intensive monitoring and treatment  given his underlying risk factors and poor health condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,14,Patient Presentation:   A 60-year-old African-American male presents to the Emergency Department complaining of a feeling of general malaise  fevers  and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He admits that he's been experiencing night sweats and unintentional weight loss over the same period. He denies any recent travel  exotic foods  risky sexual behavior  but admits to a history of regular intravenous drug use in his younger years.  Patient’s vitals on arrival are as follows: BP 120/80 mm Hg  HR 102 bpm  temperature of 101.4°F  RR 22 breaths per minute  and SpO2 of 92% on room air. On examination  he appears ill and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular exam reveals a new pansystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. His conjunctivae appear pale and the presence of Janeway lesions is noted on the soles of feet and palms.   The patient has a history of advanced chronic kidney disease (stage IV)  which is managed with medications including angiotensin II receptor blockers and phosphate binders. He quit smoking 5 years ago  but had a 30-pack-year smoking history prior to quitting. Additionally  multiple medical notations confirm the patient has not been adherent to his medication or treatment regimen  as well as frequent missed clinical appointments. There is also a history of homelessness documented in his medical record; his current living situation is unstable.   This presentation  coupled with his medical history and lack of adherence to medical treatment  makes the patient a high risk for native-valve infective endocarditis. Identifying signs and symptoms such as a new-onset murmur  fever  and signs of vascular phenomena or immunologic reactions further affirm clinical suspicion.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,15,Subject: 64-year-old Caucasian Male  Presenting Conditions:   The patient presents at the emergency department reporting persistent fever of 38.6 degrees Celsius (101.4 F) for two weeks  fatigue  weight loss of 5 kilograms over the past month  and new-onset shortness of breath. He also complains of night sweats and muscle pains. Physical examination reveals a heart murmur (not previously noted).  Demographics:   The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male  a retired coal miner  living in rural Pennsylvania. He is a nonsmoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. He adheres to a diet with animal protein and processed food  with a sedentary lifestyle. His body mass index (BMI) is 31 kg/m2  weighing 92kg for his height of 175cm  thus classified as obese.   Past Medical History:  He has a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  and recently experienced a myocardial infarction 6 months ago and subsequently underwent angioplasty with stent placement later. He has a known history of untreated dental caries and poor oral health. His medication history includes atorvastatin  metformin  insulin  and ramipril. He has no known drug allergies. He has never had invasive procedures  such as surgery  within the past year. His last dental check-up was performed five years ago  and no invasive dental procedures were reported.  Family History:   His mother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his father died of lung cancer at the age of 72. He has two brothers in their 60s without any significant medical conditions.  Additional Findings:  Preliminary blood tests show increased inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and ESR) and leukocytosis. Blood cultures are yet to return. An echocardiogram reveals vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Considering the above presentation  current clinical condition  and health history  the patient’s ongoing symptoms of persistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  and new-onset shortness of breath may suggest a potential case of native-valve infective endocarditis  which is common in his demographics and medical history. Further blood culture testing and a consultation with a cardiologist is recommended.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,16,A 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Smith  visits the emergency department accompanied by his wife. He is a retired schoolteacher and claims to adhere to a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Their home is in a rural hospice in Indiana where he enjoys gardening and woodworking. He presents with a 2-week history of progressive malaise  vague body aches  primarily in the joints  intermittent fevers  and night sweats. He also notes a recent loss of appetite and unanticipated weight loss which he estimates to be about 10 pounds over 2 weeks. He denies any recent travels  tick bites  or exposure to ill contacts.   His past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis for which he takes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  mitral valve prolapse diagnosed 15 years ago  and mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications. He experienced a dental procedure about three weeks ago. He has no history of IV drug abuse  blood transfusions  or sexually transmitted diseases.   On physical examination  he appears sick and diaphoretic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  and a temperature of 38.5°C. Oral examination reveals poor dentition. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur best heard at the apex. The rest of the physical examination  including neurologic examination  is normal.  Lab test notes leukocytosis and a positive blood culture for viridans group streptococci. An echocardiogram shows vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the suspected diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,17,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Hernandez  a 60-year-old obese Hispanic male  presents in the emergency department with a history of intermittent fever for two weeks which was earlier low grade  accompanied by chills  a significant weight loss around 10 pounds and excessive fatigue for the same duration. Mr. Hernandez also complained of a recently developed slight shortness of breath while moving within his house and unexplained discomfort in the chest.  He has a complicated past medical history that includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  controlled with Metformin  and Hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril  both of which were diagnosed 13 years ago. Patient also mentioned a history of untreated dental caries  recent dental extraction around a month ago and an intravenous drug use 30 years ago during his early adult life  which he successfully left 25 years ago. He denies any recent travel  surgeries or exposure to contagious diseases  and he has no known allergies.  Family history reveals his father died of heart failure and his mother is diabetic. He is a retired taxi driver  a non-smoker though he consumed alcohol socially in the past. His BMI is 31.  The patient also complains about a new onset of back pain and a three-day history of worsening weakness in his lower limbs. Upon physical examination  we noticed a mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the apex with the patient in left lateral position  some mild crackles in both lower lung fields. Neurologic exam was significant for some decrease in light-touch sensation in both lower legs and feet  and decrease in muscle strength in his legs. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  This clinical scenario and his past history suggest a potential case of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis complicated by potential heart failure and possible early septic emboli to the spine  although more diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,18,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Anderson  a 68-year-old African American male construction worker from rural southern parts of New York  presents to the emergency department accompanied by his wife  complaining of a fever of 101.3°F  up-and-down body temperature for the last two weeks  fatigue  general discomfort  unexplained weight loss of about 6 lbs over the past month  and profuse night sweats. He mentions an increasing lack of energy and stamina  complaining of a decreasing exercise tolerance. He observes increased shortness of breath particularly while lying down and has to use two pillows for sleeping.  The patient has a past medical history of permanent atrial fibrillation (for which he takes warfarin)  hypertension  stage 2 chronic kidney disease  and a history of intravenous drug use (heroin) until his early 40s.  On physical examination  he exhibits conjunctival pallor  dental decay  and Janeway lesions can be seen on the palms and soles. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new-onset murmur best heard at the apex. His family history is significant for an ischemic heart disease in his father who died at 65. Mr. Anderson is a current smoker and used to consume alcohol heavily during his 40s.  There is a high suspicion of infective endocarditis in this patient based on his fever  new-onset murmur  other constitutional symptoms like fatigue  weight loss  Janeway lesions and his significant past medical history of atrial fibrillation  intravenous drug use  dental decay  and exposure to occupational dust.  Mr. Anderson works in construction and has possible exposure to dust  and with his history of drug abuse and menial oral hygiene  he was at high risk for developing native valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,19,Patient Information: Mr. Parker  59-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint: High-grade persistent fever  shortness of breath  and generalized fatigue for the past two weeks. Lost 10 pounds during this period due to reduced appetite and generalized weakness.  Presenting Illness: He has a daily fever that goes as high as 101 degrees (F)  accompanied by night sweats and chills. He noticed his heart beating rapidly  even when at rest  and has experienced occasional shortness of breath upon exertion. His appetite has decreased substantially  and he feels increasingly fatigued and weak. He reports occasional mild joint pains and noticed tiny red spots on the skin of his legs and feet. There is no chest pain  cough  or other symptoms.  Past Medical History: He has a documented history of intravenous drug use more than 5 years ago. He underwent treatment and has stayed clean since then. He has been previously diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease and has been on prophylactic antibiotic therapy. He has had no previous surgeries. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. There is no family history of valvular heart disease  autoimmune diseases  malignancies or any other major illnesses.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  Mr. Parker exhibited pallor and looks malnourished. He has an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and had a diastolic heart murmur. Evidence of petechiae on the skin and conjunctiva  as well as Osler nodes on his fingers and toes  was noticed.  Suspicion: Given his history of rheumatic heart disease and intravenous drug use  as well as his current signs and symptoms  there is a high suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. He will need further diagnostic tests  including blood culture and an echocardiogram  to confirm this diagnosis  and appropriate therapy should be started without any delay.  Relevant Literature: In literature  mortality rates are high in patients with native-valve endocarditis  particularly those who are older  with comorbid heart conditions  and prior intravenous drug use. Immediate medical attention and targeted therapy are critical in improving patient outcomes. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,20,Patient Presentation:  A 57-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use (last reported use approximately three months ago) and hypertension  comes to the emergency department complaining of a three-week history of malaise  intermittent fevers  night sweats  and a recent onset of pain and redness in his left foot. He also reports a 10-pound unintentional weight loss over the last month. He does not have a known history of any heart disease and denies any history of HIV or Hepatitis C infection to his knowledge. He does not have any known allergies.  On physical examination  he appears generally unwell and underweight. He is febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C  blood pressure is 100/76 mmHg  heart rate 100 bpm  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals a new grade 3/6 diastolic murmur over the left lower sternal border. Pulmonary examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. Examination of his left foot shows signs suggestive of Janeway lesions.  Blood tests show a significative elevated white blood cell count (15 500 cells/micro-liter) with a predominance of neutrophils (85%). His hemoglobin level is low (10.8 g/dL). Blood cultures are ordered and later returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram subsequently reveals vegetations on the tricuspid valve  consistent with the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,21,Patient Presentation:  A 63-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J  presented to the hospital with a two-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He also reports experiencing increasing fatigue and an episode of syncope two days ago. He has a history of intravenous drug use in his early life  though he has been in recovery for the past 20 years. He also has a documented past medical history of rheumatic heart disease and was treated for strep throat numerous times in his youth. He has no known allergies but has been a smoker for over 30 years.   Over the past year  Mr. J has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Despite his previous history of IV drug use  he is currently negative for HIV and Hepatitis C. Family history reveals his mother suffered from endocarditis at an older age and his father had early coronary heart disease. His current medications include an ACE inhibitor and a statin.  On examination  he appeared ill and diaphoretic. He had a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg  a pulse of 98 bpm  a respiratory rate of 18  and a fever of 38.5 Degrees Celsius. Cardiac examination was notable for a new murmur at the apex  and two Osler’s nodes were noted on examination of his hands. An echocardiogram and blood cultures were ordered subsequently. He is currently admitted and started on empiric antibiotic treatment pending culture results.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,22,Patient Presentation:  A 64-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the hospital with a 2-week history of fever  fatigue  and weight loss. Past medical history is notable for a diagnosis of moderate rheumatic heart disease from a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood  but he has never required surgery and has not undergone any recent dental procedures. He has a 30-year pack history of smoking  drinks alcohol socially  and denies illicit drug use.  On physical examination  there were indications of undernutrition with a BMI calculated 18.8 kg/m². Vital signs showed mild fever at 38.2 degrees Celsius  heart rate of 85 beats/min  blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  respiration rate of 15 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 97% on ambient air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex  no further abnormalities were noted on chest examination. The skin showed no signs of petechiae  Osler's nodes  or Janeway lesions. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no Roth's spots.  Investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers with a white blood cell count of 13 500 cells/microlitre and a C-reactive protein level of 45mg/L. A set of blood cultures were taken and an echocardiogram ordered.  The patient’s presentation and past medical history of rheumatic heart disease is suggestive of a possibility of native valve infective endocarditis  although the definitive diagnosis will be based on blood culture results and echocardiographic findings. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,23,Patient Presentation:  John A.  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presents complaining about persistent fever  fatigue  and loss of appetite over the past two weeks. He states that he’s also experiencing night sweats and recent weight loss and notes that he feels his heart “beating out of his chest” on occasion.   Patient's medical history reveals a well-controlled type 2 diabetes and a 35-year history of intravenous drug use  although he has been clean for the past five years. There's no history of any previous cardiac disease or surgery  but he did have a bout of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia approximately 1 year ago thought to be secondary to a cutaneous abscess at an injection site.   Physical examination reveals a fever of 38.5°C  heart rate of 95 beats per minute  and a new-onset grade III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Some petechiae are also noted on the skin  but there's no evidence of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions. Neurological examination is unremarkable.   These clinical findings along with his persistent fevers  new murmur  and previous history of S. aureus bacteremia suggest possible native-valve infective endocarditis. Further evaluation with echocardiogram and blood cultures is indicated.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,24,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Charles is a 58-year-old African-American male who comes in with complaints of persistent fever (low grade) for the past 2-3 weeks  which has worsened over the past few days  malaise  loss of appetite  and a weight loss of 10 pounds. On detailed inquiry  he also mentions experiencing occasional shortness of breath  night sweats  and mild  intermittent chest discomfort. He states he lost consciousness briefly a week ago  but quickly regained consciousness.  Mr. Charles has a 30-year history of intravenous drug use but has been clean for the past three years. He has not been following well with his healthcare providers  as he was last seen 2 years ago. His previous medical history showed that he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C secondary to intravenous drug usage. There is no known history of HIV  tuberculosis  sexually transmitted diseases  or other infections. He does not report any heart murmurs  but there is also no previous echo report in the medical records reviewed.  On physical examination  he appears thin and pale. He has a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg  pulse of 96 beats/minute  respirations 18 breaths/minute  and fever of 100.8°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new onset grade 3/6 diastolic murmur. Skin reveals multiple petechiae in the lower extremities and oral mucosa shows dental caries without obvious abscess formation.  The series of events points towards a likelihood of subacute native-valve infective endocarditis  considering the long-standing history of intravenous drug use  new heart murmur  consistent fever  and vascular phenomena like petechiae and syncope episode. The confirmative diagnosis would require blood cultures and an echocardiogram looking for evidence of infected vegetations on the heart valves.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,25,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 57-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and mild temporary right-side weakness. The fever is intermittent  accompanied by night sweats. He also reports having mild joint pain and recently noticed small red spots on the palm of his hands.  Mr. Rodriguez is known to have a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a smoking history of 20 pack years and a mild to moderate alcohol drinker.  He works as a janitor and reports no recent recreational drug use or travel outside of the country. He did not undergo any invasive dental procedure in the recent past but admits to poor oral hygiene.  On physical examination  Mr. Rodriguez appears ill and is diaphoretic. His blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  pulse 96 beats per minute  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 96% on room air  and temperature 100.4°F. There are few janeway lesions on his palms and soles  osler nodes on his fingers  and splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails.  Given the symptoms  presentation  and past medical history  a working diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected. The health team recommends a series of diagnostic tests  including blood cultures  echocardiography  and other relevant laboratory tests. In the meantime  Mr. Rodriguez is started on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for empiric treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,26,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Gallegos is a 67-year-old Hispanic male presenting to the emergency department with a complaint of intermittent fevers  ranging from 99.5 to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit for the past two weeks  associated with increasing fatigue  unintended weight loss of around 5 lbs and occasional night sweats. In-between these fevers  the patient feels relatively well. He also reports a new onset of intermittent chest discomfort over the past week  occurring at rest and not related to physical exertion.  Past medical history includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a previous dental infection about a month ago for which he was prescribed antibiotics. He denies any drug use. The patient is a retired farmer and lives with his wife.   This presentation raises concern for possible infective endocarditis given his background of dental infections and new-onset cardiovascular symptoms. Further testing and consultation with cardiology and infectious disease specialists would be appropriate.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,27,"A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents with a 3-week history of persistent fevers  night sweats  and unintentional 10-pound weight loss. He mentions he has experienced increasing fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. Remarkably  recurrent arthritis has been a problem especially in his left knee. He reports occasional heart """"fluttering """" but denies chest pain or syncope.  The patient is a retired construction worker and a smoker of 20 years. He has a past medical history of degenerative arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which he uses tiotropium inhalation. He denies any use of recreational drugs.  On physical examination  the patient appears ill-appeased  his BMI is 28  blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg  pulse of 98 bpm  temperature of 38.7 °C. Cardiac examination revealed a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border and a previously undiscovered cardiac murmur. Other significant findings include splinter hemorrhages in fingernails  conjunctival petechiae  and a swollen  tender left knee. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.  His EKG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Lab tests show increased inflammatory markers with a white blood count of 13 000/µl and C-reactive protein of 10mg/dl. Blood cultures have been drawn and he has been admitted for further evaluation under the impression of infective endocarditis. High-resolution transthoracic echo will be performed to verify the condition of the heart valves. "
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,28,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jose Santiago  a 60-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of persistent fever  severe night sweats  new-onset shortness of breath  and unintended weight loss over the past month. He also mentions the appearance of red spots on his hands and feet recently.  He has a documented history of longstanding uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type-2  diagnosed 15 years ago  but has been noncompliant with his medications. Additionally  he had aortic valve replacement surgery due to severe aortic stenosis approximately 3 years ago. The patient denied any other history of cardiovascular disease.  Mr. Santiago has a known history of intravenous drug use over the last 20 years but has been sober for the past 2 years. He is currently unemployed and lives alone. He does not have any known drug allergies. He is a life-long smoker with a 30 pack-year history. His father died in his early 60s with a heart attack  and his mother had type-2 diabetes mellitus.   On physical examination  he appears chronically ill. Cardiac examination reveals a murmur best heard at the left sternal border and the lung examination has rales at the bases. Splinter hemorrhages are observed under his fingernails and petechiae on his lower extremities. Systolic blood pressure measures 110 mm Hg and diastolic 70 mm Hg  and his heart rate is 95 beats per minute.  The presenting symptoms align with the potential diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis but would need confirmatory diagnostic tests  including blood cultures and heart imaging. Patient's history of intravenous drug use and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus provide potential predisposing factors. An interdisciplinary team's immediate action is necessary to manage this high-risk patient.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,29,Patient Presentation == A 60-year-old Caucasian male  longtime smoker  presents to the emergency department complaining of intermittent fevers and night sweats for the past 6 weeks. He also mentions marked loss of appetite  weight loss  and occasional shortness of breath recently. On questioning  he admits to a history of intravenous drug use in his 20s and 30s  although he has now been in recovery for over 15 years. He has a known history of mild aortic stenosis  moderate pulmonary hypertension  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and is currently on appropriate medication for these conditions.  On clinical examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 101.5°F  blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg  pulse 105 bpm  and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur that is best heard in the right second intercostal space. Also noted are Osler's nodes in his hands and feet and Janeway's lesions on the palms and soles.   Given his history of malaise  anorexia  and fever along with new murmurs and typical vascular and immunological phenomena  there is immediate concern for infective endocarditis  warranting further urgent investigation and care.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,30,Patient Presentation:  Ms. X is a 67-year-old African American female who presents to our clinic for evaluation of a 3-week history of intermittent fever  nausea  and fatigue. A retired caterer  she has a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well-controlled with Metformin  and aortic stenosis diagnosed two years prior during a routine visit with no subsequent intervention.  Recently  she noted unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds over the past two months. She denies any travel history  recent surgery  use of recreational drugs including IV drugs  or any recent procedures. Ms. X is a widower  lives alone  and is consistent with her medications with no known drug allergies. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease  her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 69.  On physical examination  she has low-grade fever  mild pallor  purple colored lesions on feet (Janeway lesions)  tender  nodular swellings on pads of her fingers (Osler's nodes)  and a new cardiac murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Other systems were essentially within normal limits. Lab results showed mildly elevated ESR  CRP  and neutrophilic leukocytosis.  Based on her clinical presentation  risk factors  and physical exam findings  a high suspicion of possible native-valve infective endocarditis was made. Approval was obtained for further workup including blood cultures and an echocardiogram.  In this patient’s scenario  the demographics are accurately represented  in accordance with the literature. According to medical literature  older adults are more susceptible to infective endocarditis and African-Americans have been shown to have a relatively higher risk. Also  individuals with a past medical history of valvular heart disease  in this case  aortic stenosis  have an increased risk. Her symptoms including intermittent fever  fatigue  weight loss  and the observed Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes on physical examination correlate well with classic signs of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,31,Patient Presentation:  A 64-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss over the last three weeks. Additionally  he reports night sweats and shortness of breath on exertion  which have progressively worsened over this period. He has a past medical history significant for intravenous drug abuse which was a problem about 20 years ago and has been clean ever since. He also has mild hypertension that is controlled with diet and occasional use of medication.  On examination  the patient appears ill and fatigued. His blood pressure is 138/90 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 per minute  and temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. A cardiac examination reveals mild tachycardia and a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. He also exhibits petechiae on his palms and soles  and a Roth spot on fundoscopy. His lung fields are clear to auscultation and he has no evidence of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly on abdominal examination.  The patient and his wife confirm a lack of recent dental procedures or other invasive procedures and deny any known heart diseases or conditions. He does not have any allergies and is not currently on any medications. His family history is notable for coronary artery disease in his father  who passed away at the age of 75.  Given the findings on examination coupled with the patient's past medical history  there is a strong clinical suspicion for native valve infective endocarditis. The patient is admitted for further diagnostic tests including blood cultures  complete blood count  EKG  and echocardiography. Pending the results  empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected infective endocarditis is begun.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,32,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 58-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  profuse night sweats  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds. His body temperatures have been fluctuating with documented spikes up to 103.0°F. He also reports general fatigue  and dyspnea on exertion that has been progressively worsening over the past week.  He has a known 20-year history of intravenous drug use  with the last known use about 2 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for Hepatitis C infection  chronic back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease  and occasional episodes of cellulitis. He does not have any known cardiac history and has been relatively healthy until this episode.  He lives alone and denies any recent travel or exposure to animals. He has been unemployed for the past five years and currently survives on disability benefits. He has had multiple visits to the local soup kitchen due to financial constraints. He has a 30-pack-year history of cigarette smoking but denies any alcohol or other substance use.   On examination  he appears cachectic and generally ill. He exhibits poor dentition and multiple skin scars indicative of intravenous drug use. Cardiac exam is notable for a new diastolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical exam is only remarkable for low-grade fever and tachycardia.  Given his history and presentation  there's concern for native valve infective endocarditis  likely secondary to his intravenous drug use. Further diagnostic workup  including blood cultures and echocardiography is planned.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,33,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Lopez is a 60-year-old Hispanic male farmer  who presents today with a 2-week history of intermittent high-grade fever  chilling  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5kg. The patient also reports experiencing fatigue  weakness  and a loss of appetite. His fever has been associated with a general malaise  poor concentration  and mild shortness of breath. Upon further enquiry  he reveals a history of intermittent dysuria over the past two months and recurrent dental abscesses which he has treated with over-the-counter medications.  His medical history is significant for rheumatic fever in his youth  which resulted in moderate damage to the mitral valve and thus has lived with mitral valve regurgitation for years. His last dental treatment was about 3 months ago. He has also been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus which is controlled with metformin and lifestyle modification. He is non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. His family history is significant as his father had a heart disease.  On physical examination  he appears fatigued and in mild-to-moderate distress. Temperature is 38.4 degree Celsius  Blood pressure is 125/85mmHg  Heart rate of 110/min  and respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. His oral examination reveals poor dentition with a significant amount of dental tartar  caries  and inflammation. Cardiac auscultation reveals a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur at the cardiac apex. His lung fields are clear to auscultation. Palms show Janeway lesions and there are splinter hemorrhages under a few of his fingernails. His neurological examination  however  is normal.  The above symptoms and findings are suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis  especially with his history of previous cardiac valve damage and poor dentition  and his clinical presentation of extended fever and signs of systemic infection. Further diagnostic workup  such as blood cultures and an echocardiogram  are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,34,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Brenda Knight is a 62-year-old African American female who presents to your clinic complaining of a two-week period of intermittent fever  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of about 4 kg. She reports a low-grade fever that sometimes reaches 100.5°F accompanied by chills  poor appetite  fatigue  and aching muscles.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Knight has a documented history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension  which are under management with Metformin 500mg twice daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily respectively. She quit smoking 15 years ago but has a 30-pack year history. She doesn't drink alcohol.   Social History:  She is retired after working for many years as a high school teacher. She lives alone and has a dedicated caregiver who assists with shopping and cleaning. Ms. Knight's daughter visits her weekly  while her grandchildren visit once a month. She doesn't have any recent travels or exposure to farm animal or pets.  Examination:  On physical examination  she appears generally unwell  with pale conjunctiva and slight jaundice. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new-onset murmur best heard at the mitral area  suggestive of mitral incompetency. There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. Her blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg  pulse rate is 88 beats/min  and she has a mild to moderate fever of 100.4°F.   Given her symptoms and physical examination findings  she was admitted and blood cultures were taken. The suspicions of infective endocarditis arose due to the presentation of fever and the new murmur in a patient with risk factors for this condition  ie. hypertension and diabetes. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was started pending the blood culture results.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,35,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male  known smoker with a 30 pack-year history  presented to the emergency department reporting of persistent fatigue  intermittent fevers  night sweats  significant weight loss (approximately 10% of body weight) over the 6 weeks  and a new heart murmur noted by his primary care provider.  The patient was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and has a history of IV drug use. He is on regular medications including metformin and statins. He has a family history of aortic valve disease  with his father having had a valve replacement.  Physical examination revealed low-grade fever (37.8°C)  HR 95 bpm  BP 135/85  RR 18. Cardiac examination is notable for a new pansystolic murmur louder at the left sternal border. Cutaneous examination showed several painless  erythematous lesions on his palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions  and bleeding into the skin (Petechiae) was noted on his lower extremities. Ophthalmologic exam revealed presence of Roth spots.  Labs showed increased ESR and CRP indicating active inflammation. His blood glucose level was slightly elevated  and his lipid profile was within regular range owing to his compliance with medications. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was started on empiric antibiotics for suspected infective endocarditis. Confirmation of diagnosis awaits echocardiography and subsequent blood culture results. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,36,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Jacob Diaz  a 56-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever  intermittent chills  fatigue  and malaise that have been ongoing for the last 3 weeks. Mr. Diaz also expresses concern about an unexplained weight loss of 15 lbs over the same period  despite no deliberate changes in diet or exercise.   He reports a history of intravenous drug use during his early adulthood but has been sober for the past 15 years. His wife also reports that he has a """"new"""" heart murmur  although this has not been evaluated by a physician yet. Mr. Diaz has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin  and hepatitis C. He is allergic to penicillin.  Mr. Diaz is originally from Puerto Rico and works as a mechanic. He lives with his wife and has two adult children. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years but denies any current alcohol or recreational drug use.  On examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 100.9 F degrees  blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg  pulse 90/min and respiration rate 20/min. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new pansystolic murmur. Moreover  funduscopic examination revealed Roth spots.                                                                                                                           Given his risk factors including history of intravenous drug use  presence of fever with a new murmur  recent weight loss  and presence of Roth spots  there is a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis.   Lab tests including blood cultures and an echocardiogram have been ordered to further assess the underlying etiology of his symptoms. Mr. Diaz has been admitted to the hospital for further work-up and pending culture results  he has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected infective endocarditis."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,37,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Alvarez is a 65-year-old Hispanic female with a significant history of intravenous (IV) drug use  presenting to the emergency department with complaints of fever  chills  fatigue  and weight loss over the past month. She states that she has also been experiencing night sweats and a new onset of lower back pain. She admits to ongoing illicit drug use  specifically IV heroin  but denies any recent needle sharing practices. She has no known allergies and has been mostly out of medical care for the past decade.  Ms. Alvarez reports experiencing what she described as """"heart flutters"""" for the past few days. She also reports a persistent cough but denies any other respiratory symptoms  such as chest pain or difficulty breathing. No gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported.  Her past medical history is significant for hepatitis C and recurrent cellulitis secondary to IV drug use. She lacks any medical records of recent health surveillance  immunizations or screenings. She also reports being homeless and a lack of regular access to hygienic facilities.  On physical examination  she was noted to have poor dentition with evidence of dental caries and poor oral hygiene. Upon cardiac examination  a new systolic murmur was identified.  With her background of IV drug use and new systolic murmur accompanied with systemic symptoms  there is a high suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic investigation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  is warranted."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,38,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Hawkins is a 58-year-old Caucasian female who presents with complaints of persistent high grade fever of two weeks duration  chills  night sweats  decreased appetite and significant fatigue. She has also noticed that she has become increasingly short of breath over the past week even while performing her daily routine activities.  Past medical history is significant for intravenous drug use  which she quit 5 years ago. She was diagnosed with Hepatitis C related to her IV drug use 6 years ago. She has a known history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which she manages with oral medications. She has not had any surgical interventions in the past. Ms. Hawkins is a smoker  with a 25 pack-year history. She also consumes alcohol moderately.  Family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases as her father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 62. Her mother is alive  with a history of hypertension and type II diabetes.  Her vital signs are stable but she does have a slight fever at 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Physical examination revealed a new heart murmur. The patient was pale  with some weight loss noticed. Fundoscopic examination showed Roth spots and further examination showed Osler's nodes on her palms and soles  as well as Janeway lesions.  Given her history of IV drug use  the new murmur  and physical exam findings  Ms. Hawkins' presenting symptoms are concerning for native-valve infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,39,Patient Presentation  A 45-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use and hepatitis C presents to the clinic with persistent fever  chills  unintentional weight loss  and malaise over last one month. The patient also noted the presence of small painful nodules on his fingertips and occasional chest pain. He has not sought medical attention for these until now. He is homeless and reports drug relapse last month after six years of sobriety. He denies any known drug allergies.  On physical examination  the patient is febrile with a temperature of 38.7 C  heart rate is 96 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute  blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination shows a new harsh mid-systolic murmur at left sternal border. Skin examination reveals some reddish-purple painless spots on his palms.   Lab tests reveal leukocytosis and elevated ESR and CRP levels. Blood cultures have been drawn and sent to the lab.  Given his presentation and his risk factors – history of intravenous drug use  homelessness  and hepatitis C  a suspicion of infective endocarditis is warranted. The next step would be to get a transthoracic echocardiogram to support diagnostic evidence of the condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,40,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Edwards is a 67-year-old African-American woman presenting to the office with a 4-week history of progressive  low-grade fevers  malaise  and a weight loss of about 7 lbs.   Social History:  She has a past history of intravenous drug use but has reportedly been sober for more than 20 years. She lives alone and is a retired school teacher. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol excessively. There is no history of recent travel  dental procedures  or contact with sick individuals.  Medical History:  Notably  she has a past medical history of rheumatic fever as a teenager and was diagnosed with mitral valve stenosis in her late forties. She has been on no medications and her vaccinations are up to date. Additionally  she has mild hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. She does not have any known drug allergies.  Physical Exam:  On physical examination  she appears fatigued. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 99.9°F  blood pressure of 138/85 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. A new mid-systolic murmur is appreciated on auscultation. She has several very small  painless red and purple spots on her palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions.   Plan:  Given her history and clinical findings  undiagnosed native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected. Her doctors plan to perform further diagnostic tests  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  to confirm the diagnosis.   Discussion:  Ms. Edwards' demographic details  including age  race  and past medical history of rheumatic fever and mitral stenosis put her at a higher risk for infective endocarditis. The combination of prolonged  unexplained fever  new onset of murmur  and evidence of vascular phenomena (Janeway lesions) in this clinical context strongly suggest infective endocarditis. The plan is to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism to guide further management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,41,Patient Presentation:  Mr. A is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presents to the emergency department with recent onset of unexplained fatigue  intermittent fever  and night sweats. He has been previously healthy  with no known past medical history. He has a history of dental problems  had a tooth extraction approximately six weeks ago. He is a smoker with a 20-pack-year history and denies any drug use. On physical examination  he is slightly underweight  febrile  and appears ill. He has a new systolic murmur noted on cardiovascular exam. Skin examination reveals scattered petechiae. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. His blood cultures are positive for Streptococcus viridans. He's been diagnosed with infective endocarditis  likely secondary to poor dental hygiene and dental procedure leading to bacteremia. The smoking history suggests a general lack of attention to health promoting behaviors  aligning with the more common finding of infective endocarditis to be found in individuals who have poor dentition or those who do not receive regular dental care.   This demographic aligns as the proportions of IE patients vary considerably by race and ethnicity  with the largest group from white ethnicity  followed by Hispanics. Men made up the greater part of the population across all age groups and in all regions. Middle-aged patients  particularly those aged 45–64 years  had the highest disease rate of IE.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,42,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Richardson is a 64-year-old African American female  who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an ongoing fever of one to two weeks duration  associated with chills and fatigue. She reports experiencing a worsening shortness of breath over the past few days  particularly upon exertion.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatic heart disease diagnosed in her 30s and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has no history of drug abuse. She has been recently diagnosed with severe mitral valve regurgitation and has been advised to undergo surgery. However  she has been non-compliant with her medication regimen and medical appointments due to caring for her ailing husband at home.  On physical examination  she is lethargic  febrile with a temperature of 38.4°C  and mildly tachycardic with a pulse of 101 beats per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals an early diastolic murmur. Both the spleen and liver are palpable and tender. Unusual skin findings include an erythematous linear streaks on her palms (Janeway lesions) and painful erythematous nodules on her fingertips (Osler's nodes).  Her overall presentation combined with her past medical history of rheumatic heart disease  diabetes  and recent mitral valve pathology  make native-valve infective endocarditis a highly possible diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,43,Patient Presentation: Mr. John Baker is a 62-year-old African-American male  a smoker with a history of injection drug use and congestive heart failure  presenting with fatigue  fever  and heart murmur. He reports episodes of persistent  low-grade fever over the last two weeks  unexplained weight loss  night sweats  and increasing fatigue. Additionally  he reports episodes of dyspnea on exertion and increased swelling in his lower extremities. He admits to sporadic adherence to his heart failure medications due to financial constraints. He denies recent antibiotic use.  Recent past medical history includes staged leg amputations secondary to peripheral arterial disease. His vital signs on admission revealed a temperature of 100.5°F  blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg  heart rate of 92 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He is currently unemployed and lives alone. He has a history of substance abuse  with multiple episodes of discontinuing rehabilitation efforts. He is not on regular follow-up with a primary care provider.  On examination  the patient appears cachexic. Cardiac auscultation reveals a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur and a gallop rhythm. There are splinter hemorrhages present in the nails of his upper and lower extremities  and initial echocardiography reveals vegetations on his native mitral valve.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,44,Subject is a 45-year-old Caucasian male presenting with fever  fatigue  and an irregular heart rhythm. He also reports recent weight loss and night sweats. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use  particularly heroin  and was diagnosed with hepatitis C several months ago.  During physical examination  tenderness was noted in his spleen and Osler's nodes were present on his fingers and toes. A heart murmur was also audible upon cardiac auscultation. As per patient history  he had experienced a few intermittent episodes of fever over the past month but dismissed them as unimportant.  Further inquiry indicated that he had been using drugs via the same needle without swapping or sterilizing between uses. His experience with fever  coupled with his prolonged IV drug misuse  prompts suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,45,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony  a 60-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with complaints of persistent fever of two weeks duration  fatigue  night sweats  and unintended weight loss of about 10 pounds over the last month. He denies any cough  chest pain  shortness of breath  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  He was released from prison 15 days ago after serving time for multiple drug charges. His history is significant for heroin use for which he had been receiving methadone maintenance therapy prior to imprisonment but had relapsed for a short period before his recent release. He also has a known history of rheumatic heart disease and had been non-compliant with penicillin prophylaxis.  On physical examination  he displayed signs of poor dentition. Cardiac examination was significant for a new systolic murmur heard best at the apex which radiated to the axilla. Janeway lesions were noted on the palms and soles  and painless  erythematous Osler’s nodes were seen on his fingers. No peripheral edema  jugular venous distention or hepatosplenomegaly was noted.   Initial investigations including full blood count  inflammatory markers  kidney function tests  liver function tests  and chest X-ray were requested. Blood cultures were also obtained  given the clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis. Echocardiogram was ordered to confirm the diagnosis.    In view of his symptoms  history  and clinical presentation  the provisional diagnosis of infective endocarditis  likely as a result of Staphylococcus aureus infection secondary to intravenous drug use  was made. The patient was admitted for close monitoring and empiric treatment was started with intravenous antibiotics pending blood culture results.   Healthcare teams including cardiology  infectious diseases  and addiction medicine were consulted to manage the patient's endocarditis  underlying heart disease  and substance abuse disorder.   The patient was also educated about the importance of consistent penicillin prophylaxis for his rheumatic heart disease to prevent recurrent endocarditis events and the potential for fatal complications if non-compliance persisted. Methadone was restarted to manage his opioid dependence. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,46,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 62-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use (IVDU)  hypertension  and type II diabetes mellitus. He was brought to the emergency department by his son  complaining of worsening malaise  low-grade fever  and generalized body aches and sweats for the past three weeks. The patient also reported unintentional weight loss  shortness of breath on exertion  and loss of appetite.   On examination  he was found to be febrile with a temperature of 101.2 F  had a new murmur upon cardiac examination  and exhibited multiple needle puncture scars visible on his arms. His other vital signs were stable. Blood cultures were drawn and are currently pending.  He denied any recent visits to the dentist  surgery  or any urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. He admitted sporadic drug use in the past but denied any recent usage. He is compliant with his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases including his father who had a myocardial infarction at age 55.   The patient's clinical condition along with his notable IVDU history raises a strong suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. He has been admitted for further necessary imaging and management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,47,A 63-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with a three-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  weight loss  and progressive weakness. He has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2  hypertension  and a 30-pack year smoking history.  His history further reveals that he had a dental extraction done about 4 weeks ago. His social history reveals a sporadic use of illegal IV drugs in his 20s  but ceased approximately 35 years ago. He does not have any history of intravenous drug use recently. He reports no travel or any sick contacts. On physical examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Cardiac examination reveals a new murmur noted over the mitral area.  The patient's medical history  physical examination findings  and predisposing factors suggest a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  likely due to a dental procedure he had recently  since these usually predispose to streptococcal species infections.  This case is an example of the demographics which most commonly present with infectious endocarditis  as according to literature  the disease is most prevalent amongst males  middle-aged and elderly populations  and those with pre-existing heart conditions  diabetes  or a history of drug use  making this a typical patient presentation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,48,Patient is a 62-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department complaining of a persistent fever for the past 7 days  associated with exertional shortness of breath and generalized fatigue. He also reports intermittent mild  sharp chest pains not related with exertion along with pale color in fingers and toes when exposed to cold  swollen feet  and unintentional weight loss. He does not complain of nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain  change in bowel or bladder habits  rash  or joint pain. Denies any recent travel  insect bites  animal contact  unusual food or drink  and sick contacts. No recent dental procedures or surgeries.  Past medical history is significant for intravenous drug use  with the most recent use reported 3 weeks prior. He has been in a methadone program for the last 10 years but admits to occasional relapses  the most recent being several weeks ago. He also has a history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus and high blood pressure. Patient reports non-compliance with medications due to financial difficulties. Further  he reports a known history of mitral valve prolapse.  Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father. He does not smoke cigarettes and consumes alcohol socially. He is divorced and lives alone. He is unemployed but is actively looking for work. His only known drug allergy is to penicillin  causing a rash.    Based on the symptoms and his history of mitral valve prolapse and intravenous drug use  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected.  
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,49,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  who presented with a 2-week history of gradually worsening fever  night sweats and fatigue. He has noted a loss of appetite with an accompanied weight loss of about 10 pounds during the same period. He does not report any respiratory symptoms  urinary symptoms  rash or joint pains.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU) but he has been in recovery for the last 10 years. He has a past medical history of Hepatitis C infection which was successfully treated. He also has a known history of a bicuspid aortic valve. He has been living with this condition and has been on a regular follow-up with his cardiologist without any significant events or hospitalizations until now. He has never had surgery.  Social History: He is a retired construction worker  currently living alone. He does not drink often but used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day for about 30 years and quit 5 years ago.   Family History: His both parents suffered from coronary artery disease. His father had a percutaneous coronary intervention at the age of 55 and his mother had cardiac bypass surgery at the age of 58.  On the examination  patient appeared ill and tired. He was febrile with a temperature of 101.5 F  heart rate 96 beats per minute  normal blood pressure  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular exam revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space. There were no visible skin lesions  Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  Roth spots  or splinter hemorrhages under his nail beds.  This clinical presentation prompts an evaluation for native valve infective endocarditis  given his known cardiac structural abnormality (bicuspid aortic valve)  his constitutional symptoms (fever  malaise  anorexia  weight loss)  his past history of IVDU  and the new cardiac murmur heard upon auscultation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,50,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian male presents with a 2-week history of fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He has an intermittent fever not associated with chills or rigors. His maximum recorded temperature at home was 102 F. He also reports an intermittent  non-productive cough and occasional shortness of breath while performing his daily activities.  He has a history of intravenous drug use in his early adulthood and he quit 35 years ago. He is a retired construction worker with no significant history of exposure to carcinogens  dust or any similar agents. He has not undergone any dental procedures recently. He was previously fit and well  with no history of cardiac disease  hypertension  diabetes  or any chronic illness. He quit smoking 20 years ago and consumes alcohol socially. The patient lives with his wife in a suburban house and denies international travel or any recent changes in his lifestyle or diet.  Examination reveals frailty  weight loss  pallor  mild pitting edema of the lower extremities  and digital clubbing. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates a new  soft diastolic murmur heard better at the aortic area. The remainder of the examination is mitigative. Given his past history particularly IVDU  the new murmur  and his constellation of symptoms  a suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis was raised.    Relevant Past Medical History:   The patient has history of intravenous drug use in his earlier life but has been clean for the past 35 years with no other significant past medical history. He is a non-smoker and does not have history of diabetes or hypertension. He denies having any known cardiac issues in the past.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,51,Patient Profile:  Mr. Sanchez  a 58-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department with complaints of high-grade fever  chills  malaise  and shortness of breath  particularly on exertion  which has been progressively getting worse over the past two weeks. He also reports weight loss and decreased appetite. There is no history of recent travel  but reports a sporadic cough with occasional sputum production.  Occupation: Janitor at Public School  Lifestyle: Smoker (15 cigarettes/day for the last 30 years)  low level of physical activity  alcohol use moderate.   Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez has a known mitral valve prolapse  which is managed with monitoring and lifestyle modifications. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) managed with inhaled steroids  and hypertension controlled with lisinopril.   Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having had a myocardial infarction in his early 60s.  Medication: Metformin  Inhaled steroids  Lisinopril.  Immunization history: Routine vaccinations are all up to date except for pneumococcal vaccine.  Physical Examination: He is febrile (Temperature  101.3°F)  tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22/min  Blood Pressure 130/85 mmHg  and pulse is 92 beats/min.  There is a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. The chest is clear to auscultation  but there are some crackles in the lower zones bilaterally. There appears to be a petechial rash on his extremities  but no osler nodes or janeway lesions.  This case would warrant further investigation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  to confirm the diagnosis of possible infective endocarditis in this patient with native valve disease.  He will likely need intravenous antibiotics  and possibly surgical intervention  based on the findings of these investigations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,52,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU)  chronic Hepatitis C  and untreated dental disease  presenting with a 3-week history of fatigue  low-grade fever  and unexplained weight loss. He reports experiencing night sweats and on-and-off small joint pains during this period. He denies any recent dental procedures  IV drug use  or needle sharing in the past 6 months.  The patient lives in an urban setting and has been abstinent from IVDU for the past 6 months. His Hepatitis C was diagnosed 10 years ago and he has been intermittently compliant with antiviral therapy. He has no known allergies. Previous blood tests revealed mild anemia and elevated liver function tests  consistent with his chronic hepatitis C. He is currently unemployed and lives with his girlfriend. He has limited health-literacy skills and intermittent access to medical care.  He admits to being a chronic heavy alcohol drinker up until 6 months ago when he also quit alcohol consumption along with drugs. He is a non-smoker and denies any travel history. His current medications include sofosbuvir for Hepatitis C.  On examination  his vital signs reveal a low-grade fever of 38.2°C  heart rate 90 beats/min  blood pressure 120/70 mmHg  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. He appears fatigued. Oral examination reveals poor dentition. Cardiovascular examination identifies a new grade 3/6 diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lungs are clear to auscultation and he has good peripheral perfusion. Examination of his joints reveal mild tenderness over his hands and knees but no visible or palpable lesions.  Given his history  physical examination and the characteristic symptoms  there is a suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. An EKG is ordered and blood cultures are drawn prior to initiating empiric antibiotic therapy. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,53,Patient Presentation:  Francis  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the Emergency Department complaining of fatigue  shortness of breath  night sweats  low-grade fever  and unintentional weight loss over the past six weeks.   Francis reports an extensive history of drug abuse  especially intravenous (IV) drug use  but claims to have been clean for the past five years. He is a tobacco user and consumes alcohol casually. In terms of relevant medical history  he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C  likely from his history of IV drug use. His history also reveals previous hospital admissions for episodes of pneumonia and sepsis.   Francis has not been compliant with regular healthcare follow-ups and his immunizations are not updated. He does not have known heart conditions and his family history is not significant for cardiac diseases.  This prolonged and non-specific presentation  along with his medical history  raises the suspicion of infective endocarditis  likely native-valve given his lack of prior cardiac surgery or prosthetic valve.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,54,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of intravenous drug use and untreated dental decay. The most common causative organism of native valve endocarditis are Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus  both of which often arise from oral or skin sources  respectively. The patient was previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C due to intravenous drug use  however  he claims to have been clean for the past year. Despite this  he cannot remember the last time he visited a dentist.  He arrived at the clinic reporting symptoms of malaise  weight loss  and night sweats. He stated these symptoms have been in progress for several weeks. The patient has also experienced low-grade fever and a new onset of heart murmur. He describes having intermittent shortness of breath and generalized fatigue. He noted that the symptoms were gradually increasing  causing him to seek medical attention.  The patient does not produce any ongoing symptoms of drug withdrawal. He appears oriented and cooperative  but he looks chronically ill and unusually weary. Physical examination reveals petechiae in the conjunctiva and nail beds  Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  and Roth spots in his eyes. A cardiac examination revealed a new systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla  suggesting mitral regurgitation.  With the patient's age  history of intravenous drug use  oral neglect  and presenting symptoms  the suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis rises. His medical history of Hepatitis C and intravenous drug use put him at a higher risk of endocarditis due to possible skin or blood contaminations. Further investigations including blood cultures and an echocardiogram will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Joseph Alvarado is a 60-year-old Hispanic male presenting to the clinic with concerns about persistent  low-grade fevers over the past four weeks. In addition to the fevers  Mr. Alvarado has noticed increasing fatigue  night sweats  and reports an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds in the same period. He also complains of a new-onset  diffuse myalgia.   Mr. Alvarado has a significant medical history  including longstanding poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he manages with metformin  and a 20 pack-year history of smoking. He also reports a history of intravenous drug use in his 20s and 30s  but states that he has been sober for over 20 years.  On physical examination  Mr. Alvarado is noted to be febrile with a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. He exhibits pallor  and there are splinter hemorrhages noted in his nails. On auscultation  a new murmur is heard over the left upper sternal border. An echocardiogram is ordered  which shows vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  His blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus  a likely result of his prior intravenous drug use. His Hemoglobin A1c is found to be 9.0%  suggesting poor glycemic control over the past few months.    Note: The demographic details provided align with population-based studies indicating that infective endocarditis is more common in males  in individuals with a history of intravenous drug use and those with diabetes. Endocarditis also has a bimodal distribution  with one peak in young adults who use intravenous drugs and a second peak in older adults  particularly those with a history of heart disease or diabetes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,56,Subject is a 50-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. A. He works as a construction worker and has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU)  which he quit 5 years back. He presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  night sweats  and weight loss. Mr. A has a previous medical history of Hepatitis C  presumably related to his past IVDU.  In the past few weeks  he noted increasing fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion.  He also experienced a loss of appetite leading to substantial weight loss. Mr. A observed a new-onset rash on his extremities that he described as tiny reddish-purple spots.  He has had no recent dental procedures done or any known prior history of heart disease. However  he used to have spontaneous bleeding gums for which he failed to seek medical attention.   The family history is non-contributory  with no known genetic conditions or any heart diseases. He is a former smoker  having quit at the same time as his drug use. He occasionally consumes alcohol but has no known food or drug allergies.  Physical examination revealed the presence of a new cardiac murmur  Janeway lesions  and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. These are all suggestive of infective endocarditis. Further investigations  including blood cultures and echocardiogram  are warranted to confirm the diagnosis. It is suspected that Mr. A's history of IVDU and poor oral health may be significant contributing factors to his current condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,57,Patient Profile:  Mr. Johnson  a 45-year-old African-American male  reports to the emergency department with complaints of fever  chills  malaise  and a new onset of heart murmur which has persisted for the last three weeks. He also reports experiencing unintended weight loss and occasional night sweats.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a long history of illicit drug use and has previously been hospitalized for drug overdose. He admits to using intravenous drugs  primarily heroin  and has been through several detox and rehab programs over the years without success. His other significant past medical history includes Hepatitis C infection  which was diagnosed five years ago and is currently being managed. He also has a history of recurrent skin abscesses  thought to be related to his intravenous drug use. He does not have any known allergies.  Vital signs:  His vital signs on arrival are: Temperature: 38.4°C  Blood pressure: 105/70 mmHg  Pulse rate: 112 bpm  Respiratory rate: 18 breaths/minute  and Oxygen saturation: 94% on room air.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination reveals pale and slightly jaundiced skin  with multiple needle track marks seen on both arms. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. There are no visible signs of any extracardiac manifestations of infective endocarditis such as Osler nodes  Janeway lesions  or Roth spots. The rest of the physical examination is essentially unremarkable.  Given Mr. Johnson's history of intravenous drug use and other features consistent with infective endocarditis  he was immediately admitted for further evaluation and treatment. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis and anemia. Blood cultures have been sent to the lab and transesophageal echocardiography is planned to check for vegetations and other signs of endocarditis. Antibiotics have been initiated according to the guidelines. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,58,A 63-year-old African American male presents with symptoms of fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss over the duration of 3 weeks. He also complains of shortness of breath  chest discomfort  swelling in his feet and loss of appetite. He describes a dull ache in his right side  below the ribs. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use in his past but reports being clean for the last 15 years.   His medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic hepatitis C infection  which is stable and managed with medication. He also has a known history of mitral valve regurgitation diagnosed 10 years ago for which he is on watchful waiting  and a 40-pack-year smoking history. He has known hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medications  and his current medications include metformin  lisinopril and atorvastatin.  On physical examination  the patient appears in mild distress and diaphoretic. There's a noticeable heart murmur on cardiac auscultation. There are a cluster of painless  erythematous lesions on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions) and a few small painful nodes (Osler's nodes) on his fingers  suggesting peripheral emboli and microabscesses.  Initial lab findings show elevated ESR and CRP levels suggestive of an inflammatory response  and three separate blood cultures taken 1 hour apart have tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus.   This patient's demographic details  history of mitral regurgitation and presentation are coherent with those of a typical patient presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,59,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Franco Joseph  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  unexplained weight loss  and generalized malaise. He reports a low-grade fever primarily in the late afternoon and evening  sweats  fatigue  and a loss of approximately 4kg over the last month. He denies recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.  Mr. Joseph has a past medical history significant for bi-leaflet mechanical aortic valve replacement 10 years ago secondary to aortic stenosis  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. He is a retired construction worker and a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history.  On examination  his vital signs are within normal limits with the exception of a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. Physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the aortic area along with several small erythematous lesions on his palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions. His dental examinations showed several large cavities with notable dental decay.  Given the presentation and history  there is a high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis. Blood cultures have been sent  and the patient has been started empirically on antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. He is currently awaiting transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm vegetation on his aortic valve.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,60,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Hispanic male presents with a 10-day history of progressive malaise  intermittent fever up to 101.5°F  night sweats  and a recent onset of shortness of breath. The fever is associated with chills and decreased appetite but no cough or changes in bowel or bladder habits. The patient also reports a 15-pound unintentional weight loss over the past two months.   Patient Demographic and History:  The patient is a former construction worker; currently unemployed  living together with his wife and children. He is a current smoker with a 30-pack year history and occasionally drinks alcohol on weekends. He denies illicit drug use.  His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has no history of intravenous (IV) drug abuse  dental work  or recent bodily injuries. He never had a rheumatic fever or any allergies. There is no family history of heart diseases.   Patient's medications include metformin  losartan  and atorvastatin. His vital signs today show a temperature of 101.3°F  heart rate of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 134/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On examination  a systolic murmur grade II/VI was detected  and three small  painless  erythematous lesions were noted on his palms. His lungs are clear to auscultation.  Based on the clinical presentation  the working diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis  likely associated with his long history of smoking and potential progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiogram have been ordered to confirm the diagnosis. He was also advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol intake. Despite the lack of IV drug abuse or recent invasive procedures  his clinical presentation and risk factors (diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  cigarette smoking) raise a high suspicion for infective endocarditis. He was immediately started on empiric IV antibiotic therapy.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,61,Patient Presentation:  A 62-year-old Caucasian male patient presented at the emergency department with a two-week history of generalized fatigue  increased malaise  poor appetite  and a new unset of shortness of breath during daily activities. The patient reported an intermittent low-grade fever up to 100.5°F and unexplained 5kg weight loss within the last month. He also mentioned experiencing night sweats  but did not notice any skin changes or visual disturbances.  Yearly screenings  including echo-cardiography  have been unremarkable until now. The patient's pertinent past medical history includes a 10-year history of type II Diabetes Mellitus- adequately controlled with Metformin  essential hypertension- well managed with Lisinopril  and tobacco use disorder for the past 30 years though he quit smoking 5 years ago. The patient has no known drug allergies or prior surgeries.  The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease in his father  who had a myocardial infarction at 65 years of age.   He recently had a dental procedure done 1 month ago- root canal treatment  after which he did not take any antibiotic prophylaxis.  Considering the reported ongoing symptoms of likely systemic infection and the recent invasive dental procedure  the provider is suspicious of the patient possibly having native-valve infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,62,A 60-year-old Caucasian male comes to the clinic with complaints of fever (38.5 °C)  chills  and fatigue over the past two weeks. Patient also mentions experiencing a notable weight loss—about 6lbs over the past month—without any intentional diet or exercise changes. He has a history of intravenous drug use up until his early 40s and currently smokes cigarettes (half a pack daily for the last 35 years). Past medical history includes Hepatitis C  effectively treated about 15 years ago  hypertension  and a mild heart murmur detected in his 50s  but no history of valve disease. He takes Lisinopril daily for hypertension control. The patient also admits to maintaining poor dental hygiene.  Upon examination  he appears weak and has notable paleness. Vital signs report a heart rate of 98 beats per minute  blood pressure at 145/92 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Heart examination reveals a grade III/VI mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Upon further inspection  there are also minor petechiae on his anterior chest and shoulders. Laboratory blood tests have been ordered for the patient to explore a potential diagnosis  including blood cultures  given his symptoms and history  the possibility of infective endocarditis is considered. This falls in line with published data suggesting that the majority of patients with infective endocarditis are men  of white race  and often have a history of intravenous drug use. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,63,Patient Presentation:  A 62-year-old African American male patient  Mr. J  walks into the clinic with complaints of recurring fevers  unexplained weight loss of around 10 pounds over the last two months  fatigue  muscle joint pains  and night sweats. The fever is intermittent and high grade  recorded up to 101°F in the last two weeks. Mr. J is a smoker with a 20 pack-year history and is a retired long-distant lorry driver. He has a documented history of mild hypertension  for which he has been on and off anti-hypertensives. He mentions an untreated dental infection approximately 6 months ago.  Upon physical examination  there are Osler’s nodes on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on the palms and soles  and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. There's no history of invasive medical procedures or IV drug use. On basic lab studies  markers of inflammation (CRP  ESR) are elevated  and microcytic anemia is noted. Blood tests reveal positive blood cultures for Streptococcus viridans. Further Echocardiography shows vegetation on the mitral valve with mild regurgitation.   Taking account of the clinical presentation  examination findings  and investigation results  Mr. J has a diagnosis consistent with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes  presented to the hospital with a one-month history of low-grade fever  fatigue and weight loss of around 15 pounds. Upon further questioning  he also reported experiencing night sweats  loss of appetite  and occasional dyspnea.   Mr. Rodriguez is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife. He has a 40-pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol socially  but denies any use of illicit drugs. He has a family history of heart disease and diabetes. Mr. Rodriguez is compliant with his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. He reports he was diagnosed with rheumatic fever in his adolescence  but hasn't had any valve-related symptoms since.  On physical examination  he is febrile (temperature 100.7°F)  with a blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg  pulse rate of 88 bpm  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. Cardiac inspection reveals a regurgitant flow murmur. He is noted to have small erythematous lesions on his fingertips suggestive of Osler's nodes  and the examination of the retina shows Roth spots.   Based on these clinical findings  a diagnosis of possible native-valve infective endocarditis is considered. The patient is recommended to undergo further diagnostic evaluation  including blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiogram. He is hospitalized and started on empiric antibiotic therapy.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,65,Patient Presentation  Mr. James is a 58-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department  complaining of sudden onset of fatigue  mild chest discomfort  irregular heartbeat  shortness of breath  and nightly sweats for the past two weeks. He is a known smoker and has been consuming alcohol heavily for the last 10 years. Probability of drug use could not be ruled out. He also reported unintentional weight loss of 8 pounds over the last month. On physical examination  his vital signs revealed a low-grade fever (100.4°F)  tachycardia (heart rate 110 bpm)  and mild hypertension (BP 145/90 mmHg). Small red or purple spots on the skin called petechiae were also observed.   His past medical history is notable for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and chronic kidney disease for which he is under regular medication. He has a history of dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotics. His family history revealed that his father had rheumatic heart disease and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. He worked as a construction worker and has a history of occupational exposure to asbestos. He does not have any known contacting history of other communicable diseases.   Based on the clinical findings and the underlying comorbid patients' condition  the initial clinical impression is of native valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic tests including blood cultures  echocardiogram were ordered to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to assess the seriousness or complications of the disease. He was also referred for chest X-rays and kidney function tests due to his underlying diabetes and CKD. Other differential diagnoses to be ruled out are myocarditis  rheumatic heart disease  and aortic stenosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,66,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 63-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and intravenous drug use (IVDU) in his youth. He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with progressive generalized weakness and malaise  periodic fever with chills occurring over the last 2 weeks. He further reports intermittent night sweats and unexplained weight loss during this period. He denies any recent travel  animal exposures  or known tick bites. Patient reported an episode of blood-in-urine a week ago  though the symptom has not recurred.  On physical examination  the patient appears fatigued and mildly tachycardic. He has notable pallor  but no signs of jaundice or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac exam reveals a new grade III/VI systolic murmur that is most prominent at the apex. Small erythematous  tender nodules were found on his fingers and toes (Osler's nodes) and splinter hemorrhages were observed under the nails. There was no evidence of peripheral edema or ascites.  Overall  the patient's presentation  combined with his personal medical history of IVDU and chronic diseases  is suggestive of a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient was admitted to the hospital and further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiogram were ordered to confirm the diagnosis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,67,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Martinez  a 58-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department complaining of intermittent fevers  fatigue  and unintended weight loss over the past few weeks. The patient also reports a recent onset of exertional dyspnea and occasional night sweats.   Mr. Martinez has an extensive medical history which includes Rheumatic heart disease from his childhood  and he was diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes 10 years ago managed on oral hypoglycemic agents. He tells us that he missed his last cardiology follow-up appointment due to COVID-19 fears. He is compliant with his medications  does not smoke  drinks a glass of wine occasionally  and denies recreational drug use.   On physical examination  he appeared ill  with a low-grade fever (38°C) and tachycardia. Auscultation revealed a new harsh grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard over the mitral region. Subconjunctival hemorrhages were noticed on ocular examination  and nailbed splinter hemorrhages were seen  suggestive of systemic emboli.    Considering his clinical presentation as well as his significant medical history  infective endocarditis is on top of my differential list. He will need some more diagnostic workup which includes blood culture and an echocardiogram. Mr. Martinez might need to be admitted  and possibly started on empirical antibiotic therapy while waiting for blood culture results.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,68,A 67-year-old African American male  Mr. B  presents with a one-week history of persistent unexplained fevers  fatigue  and a new heart murmur. A retired engineer living in an urban area  the patient has a past medical history significant for chronic rheumatoid arthritis  for which he has taken methotrexate for the last 15 years. He also recently underwent dental extraction due to a dental caries about 2 months ago. He has a past long-term tobacco use has quit smoking ten years ago. He denies any recreational drug use.  On physical examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 38.7°C  blood pressure is stable at 118/78mmHg  heart rate is elevated at 102 bpm  and respiratory rate is normal at 18 breaths/min. Cardiac examination reveals a new diastolic murmur.   He was up-to-date on all immunizations. He lives with his wife  and their building has no reported cases of any infections. Mr. B denies traveling outside the country since retirement. His family history includes hypertension in both parents. His dietary habits are weighed towards high-protein  low-carb mostly.  No history of hospitalizations or major surgeries apart from dental procedures. He is overall  an active person who enjoys exercising regularly and has been feeling weak due to his current symptoms  an unusual occurrence. His medications include methotrexate and occasional over-the-counter NSAIDs for arthritic pain. He is compliant to his medications. He denies any known drug allergies.  Given his presentation  and coupled with his recent dental procedure  a differential diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was considered. Blood cultures were drawn  and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated. An echocardiography is scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,69,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old African American male presents to the emergency department with a 3-week history of intermittent fever spikes of unknown origin  accompanied by fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  joint aches  and a new-onset persistent cough. He was brought to the hospital by his daughter  about a week after his symptoms worsened  including apparent confusion and some difficulty speaking at times.   The patient is a retired construction worker  living in a rustic environment. He has a medical history of mild hypertension managed with diet and lifestyle modifications. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day for many years and consumes alcohol on social occasions. He also admits to having poor dental health with recurrent dental infections over the past few years; however  he has not sought dental treatment due to limited resources.  Physical examination reveals low-grade fever of 37.8°C  a heart rate of 100 bpm  and blood pressure of 140/85 mm Hg. He looks fatigued and mildly disoriented during the consultation. Oral examination shows poor dentition and multiple tooth caries. Auscultation of the heart reveals a new diastolic murmur. Neurological examination demonstrates slight dysarthria  but no other focal neurological deficits.   These findings prompted further investigations  which include blood cultures and cardiac imaging  to evaluate the possibility of infective endocarditis  taking into consideration his risk factors including poor dental hygiene and recurrent dental infections  as well as symptomatology and examination findings suggestive of the condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,70,A 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent fevers  weakness  night sweats  weight loss over the past four weeks  and newly onset dyspnea on exertion. The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse  but he has been abstinent for over ten years. Past medical history is significant for hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  and a dental procedure 6 weeks ago requiring antibiotics due to a history of mitral valve prolapse. Family history is unremarkable. He denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.   On physical examination  the patient appears ill and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs reveal tachycardia and a fever of 100.8°F. Cardiovascular exam reveals a new murmur heard best at the apex  suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Skin exam was significant for few petechiae noted on the lower extremities.   Initial laboratory results show elevated inflammatory markers  including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures were drawn and sent for testing. Considering the high suspicion for infective endocarditis  the patient was admitted for inpatient management and further diagnostic workup  including a transthoracic echocardiogram.   The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and ceftriaxone pending final blood culture results. His dyspnea improved significantly with initial management  and he remained hemodynamically stable. The case was discussed with the Cardiology team regarding further management strategy  depending on the echocardiography findings and culture results. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,71,The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired long-haul truck driver  who presents with a 4-week history of intermittent fever up to 101.6°F (38.7°C)  unintended weight loss of 15 pounds  malaise  and night sweats. The symptoms have gradually increased in severity over the past month. He also noticed blood in his urine two days before his visit to the clinic.   His history is significant for moderate dental decay  and he had a root canal performed about 5 weeks ago at a local dentist's office. He has also a long-standing history of rheumatoid arthritis for which he takes methotrexate. He has no known allergies and is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago  and he does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs. His family history is relevant for coronary artery disease in his father and brother  both of whom had heart attacks in their mid-60s.  On physical examination  he appears slightly pale and fatigued but is oriented and answers questions directed at him. He has a mild systolic murmur  pale conjunctivae  multiple splinter hemorrhages in his nails  and small spots on his hands and feet  which were indicative of Janeway lesions and Osler nodes. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C)  heart rate of 95 beats per minute  blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.   Based on the available information  a working diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis has raised and further confirmatory investigations are opted for.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,72,Patient Presentation:  I am seeing Mr. José Méndez  a 58-year-old Hispanic male  who presents to the clinic today accompanied by his wife  complaining of a two-week history of intermittent fever  unexplained weight loss of about 5 pounds in the next month  periodic night sweats  and noticeably increasing fatigue.   Past medical history revealed that he had a dental procedure approximately three weeks ago  from which he developed a tooth abscess. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2  which is poorly controlled  and chronic periodontitis. Mr. Méndez is a former smoker quit 10 years ago and does not drink alcohol. He does not have any allergies and is currently on Metformin for his diabetes management. He has no significant family history of any cardiac or autoimmune diseases.  He has had no prior history of intravenous drug use or any incidence of STDs. He has a small-income job and is insured under his wife's work insurance. His dental procedure was performed at the local county clinic since he does not have dental insurance. While Mr. Méndez did receive prophylactic antibiotics  the persistent tooth abscess and his poor oral hygiene could have served as a source for bacterial infection that might have potentially seeded his heart valves  given the temporal association of his symptoms.   On physical examination  he appears chronically ill. Temperature is 38.2 degrees Celsius. There were also Osler's nodes on his fingers' pads and Janeway lesions over his palms  indicative of end organ damage secondary to septicemia. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new-onset murmur over the mitral area. There was no peripheral edema observed. The rest of the examination was normal.  Based on his presentation  history  and physical examination findings  native valve infective endocarditis is a consideration  more common in males and those with poor dentition or invasive dental procedures. Further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,73,Patient: Mr. Raymond  a 56-year-old African American male  presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of high-grade fever  malaise  and myalgia  persisting for over a week. He reports recently experiencing night sweats and a noticeable weight loss. He notes that his symptoms have gradually worsened  prompting his visit to the ED. The patient appears ill  is notably diaphoretic  and looks chronically unwell.  His past medical history is significant for intravenous (IV) drug use  being clean for the past eight years. He also discloses a 30-year history of heavy tobacco use but claims to have quit five years prior. Raymond reveals a known history of chronic Hepatitis C infection  but HIV test was negative two years ago. He denies any known history of heart disease.   Raymond directly states that he has not recently traveled outside his local area  has not been hospitalized  undergone surgery  or received any type of invasive procedure in the past year. He denies any known dental problems in the recent past.   This history  combined with his ongoing febrile state and previous IV drug use  elevates the concern for the possibility of native valve infective endocarditis  despite his prolonged abstinence from drugs.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,74,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the clinic complaining of fatigue  low-grade fevers  and night sweats persisting for the past six weeks. The patient claims he has also been experiencing an unintentional weight loss of about 6 pounds in this time. More recently  over the last week  he describes intermittent shortness of breath and a new-onset decline in exercise tolerance.   Past Medical History:  He has a known medical history of degenerative mitral valve disease diagnosed 5 years ago  for which he has been on watchful waiting per his cardiologist. He also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin  and has a 20-pack-year smoking history  although he reportedly quit smoking fifteen years ago. There is no history of intravenous drug use.  Family History:  There is a family history of cardiac diseases  with his father who passed away at the age of 62 due to myocardial infarction. He has a brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease at 55.  Social Demographics:  The patient is retired and previously worked as a warehouse manager. He lives with his wife and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He has no travel history in the last year  and there were no recent changes in his medications  diet habits  or exercise routine.  Concern:  Given his previous mitral valve disease and diabetic status  the patient’s presentation raises concerns for possible native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic evaluation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  is necessary. The patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis and the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent possible valvular infections. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,75,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the clinic complaining of a three-week history of fever  nighttime sweats  generalized fatigue  a recent occurrence of a rash on the palms and soles  and sudden weight loss of 5 kilograms over the last month without any intention of losing weight.  His past medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus  high blood pressure  and a recorded mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation diagnosed 2 years ago. He does not have a history of IV drug use  and has no history of valve replacement surgery.   There are no known allergies. He has been on metformin and ramipril for the past ten years. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and quit 2 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and is up to date on all immunizations.   On his last visit one year ago  the physical exam was normal except for audible mitral valve """"click"""" on auscultation of the heart. A repeat echocardiogram was suggested but the patient did not follow up.  On today's physical examination  blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  heart rate is 98 bpm  temperature is 38.5C. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new grade III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex with radiation to the axilla  and scattered petechiae on his palms and soles. His oral health is poor with several missing and decaying teeth.    This patient's demographics  extended history of heart disease  and combination of symptoms might suggest a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures  ECG and a transthoracic echocardiogram have been ordered to establish diagnosis."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,76,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of intermittent fever and chills  malaise  and progressive shortness of breath. Mr. Doe is a retiree and lives with his wife. They have a pet dog at home.  Mr. Doe is a former smoker  has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and was diagnosed with aortic stenosis 10 years ago. His father also had heart disease. He has no known drug allergies. Medications include metformin and occasional over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis pain.  Mr. Doe reports a dental procedure performed about a month ago. He denies using intravenous drugs or having recent tattoos. He hasn't traveled recently and has never received a blood transfusion.  On physical examination  Mr. Doe appears fatigued and mildly in distress. His vitals on admission include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F)  heart rate 110 bpm  blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg  respiratory rate 20 bpm  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Cardiac exam reveals a new murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation and there are petechiae on his palms and soles.   This raises clinical suspicion for native valve infective endocarditis in the context of his recent dental procedure and chronic heart disease. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram is recommended.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,77,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 60-year-old African American male  presenting to the emergency department with a week-long history of persistent fever  chills  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. Recently  he also began experiencing shortness of breath and a mild  dull chest discomfort.  John has a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease following a streptococcal infection in his childhood. He also has a 20-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  and he underwent a dental procedure 2 weeks ago.  On physical examination  Mr. Smith looks generally unwell and has a high-grade fever of 39.3°C. Auscultation of the heart reveals a new holosystolic murmur in the mitral area. Additionally  a few petechial rashes are seen disseminated on his lower extremities. His oral hygiene is noticeably poor.  Following suspicion of infective endocarditis  further workup reveals positive blood cultures growing Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram confirms large vegetation on his mitral valve  strengthening the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. He’s admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment and further evaluation for possible valve replacement surgery. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,78,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 50-year-old African American male who arrived at the clinic stating that he's been experiencing a fever of 101.5°F  chills and night sweats for the past two weeks. Besides the fever  he has also been experiencing shortness of breath and unexplained weight loss. He rates his fatigue as a 6 out of 10 over the past few days. On physical examination  he presented with a heart murmur. He appeared fatigued  but the rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.  His past medical history is significant for a bicuspid aortic valve discovered about 5 years prior. Besides this  he was generally a healthy social worker who stated he had no recent travel history  no illicit drug use  no history of sexually transmitted diseases  or hepatitis. He does not smoke or drink alcohol and his family history was non-contributory.  This patient's high persistent fever  night sweats  heart murmur  and the fact that he has a bicuspid aortic valve places him at high risk for native valve infective endocarditis. Other symptoms like fatigue  weight loss and shortness of breath can also be manifestations of this condition. This clinical scenario is suggestive of an infective endocarditis case.   Literature shows that the mortality rate for endocarditis is higher in African Americans  therefore early detection and intervention for Mr. Smith's case could greatly improve his prognosis. Considering his risk factors and presentation  further investigations would be required to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment for infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,79,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Anita  a 60-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the hospital emergency department. She has been feeling progressively tired for the last week and reports a constant  low-grade fever for about 5 days. Anita was previously diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in her youth and has had a history of intravenous drug use in her 40's (no current substance misuse). She also has a known mitral valve prolapse.  Over the last 6 months  she’s lost a considerable amount of weight and has reduced her alcohol consumption due 'just not enjoying it anymore'. She dismissed the fatigue and weight loss as part of ageing  but the persistent fever has concerned her. She insists she hasn't been overseas nor has she been in touch with anyone ill recently.  Initial examination showed BP 144/90 with a resting heart rate of 105 bpm. Physical examination reveals pallor  splinter hemorrhages in her nails  and a new murmur on auscultation. Blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers.  Given her history and presenting symptoms  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected in Anita. An echocardiogram is ordered to confirm.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,80,Patient Presentation  Ms. Jones is a 63 year-old African American female patient presenting to the ER with complaints of a new onset fever  chills  malaise and progressive fatigue over the last two weeks. History indicates a change in heart murmur  anorexia and weight loss. Past medical history is significant for long-standing untreated rheumatic heart disease  with known mitral valve regurgitation. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is originally from a low-income neighborhood  and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  With regards to her family history  her father died of complications from heart disease. On clinical examination  she has pale pallor  petechiae over extremities and conjunctival hemorrhage. Cardiac examination reveals a previously known systolic murmur and there is a new found diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. Fundoscopy examination reveals Roth spots. She is hemodynamically stable but looks chronically ill.   Given the overall clinical presentation  differential diagnosis includes native valve bacterial infective endocarditis. Urgent complete blood work including blood cultures  ESR  CRP and echocardiography to identify vegetation over valve is suggested. Ms. Jones has been admitted to the hospital for close monitoring  supportive care and the initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,81,Patient Information: A 62-year-old Asian male  living in a urban area  with a history of intravenous drug use  Chief Complaint: Persistent fever for the last two weeks  loss of appetite  weight loss  and fatigue  History of Present Illness:  The patient reports having fever persisting for a couple of weeks despite taking over-the-counter medications. The fever is of moderate intensity  reaching to a maximum of 38.5°C  and is associated with night sweats. Additionally  he is experiencing loss of appetite  weight loss of ~5 kg over a month  and increased fatigue. He also complains of occasional night cough and has noticed some red spots on his skin recently.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use  and positive for hepatitis C. No history of diabetes  hypertension or congenital heart conditions. No allergies known to any medications.  Family History: Father had coronary artery disease and passed away in his early 70s. Mother is alive and well.  Social History:  Patient potentially lives alone as a divorcee  works as a software engineer  has a history of intravenous drug use though he states he is trying to quit. Smokes half a pack a day for about 20 years.  Review of Systems: On further inquiry  the patient also admitted to experiencing occasional chest pains and palpitations.  Physical Exam: Patient displays mild pallor. Observable petechiae on his lower and upper extremities. Bilateral basal rales observed on chest auscultation. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur. Remainder of the examination is within normal limits.  Clinical Impression: The presence of persistent fever  new murmur  and history of intravenous drug use raise a suspicious for native-valve infective endocarditis. Immediate blood cultures followed by transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate antimicrobial therapy are suggested. The rash on his extremities may be Janeway lesions  signs of septic emboli  which is consistent with infective endocarditis. The weight loss and fatigue speak to the chronic nature of disease  possibly due to long-term effects of septicemia and recurring fevers.  Plan:  The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further diagnostic tests and more immediate control of symptoms. A seriousness of the condition was explained to the patient and he has given consent for hospital admission. The infectious disease team will be consulted for further management. A transthoracic echocardiogram and blood cultures will be obtained immediately.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,82,Patient Presentation:  Mr. B is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the cardiology clinic with a complaint of 2 weeks of persistent  unexplained low-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats. He also reports occasional shortness of breath and a newly developed intermittent heart murmur which was reported during his recent visit to a general practitioner. He denies any recent dental procedures or other invasive procedures.  Mr. B has a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use in his twenties  but states he has been clean for several years. His other medical history includes controlled hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. Family history was unremarkable for any heart disease.  On physical examination  he appeared unwell. His temperature was 100.4°F  with a regular pulse of 110 beats per minute  a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac exam revealed a new systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Rounding out the physical examination were findings of minute  painless  red spots underneath the skin of his fingers (Osler's nodes) and on the palms of his hands (Janeway lesions) - both suggestive of endocarditis.  The patient's clinical picture  symptoms  and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  which is a life-threatening disease. Blood cultures have been taken and started on empirical antibiotic treatment awaiting culture results. He was admitted to the hospital for further management including imaging studies to assess any other potential sites of infection or complications. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,83,Patient Presentation:   Mr. J is a 53-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of high-grade fever  malaise  and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He admits to having a history of intravenous drug use but has been clean for the past two years. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  type II diabetes  and chronic hepatitis C infection  which are all well-managed with medication. On examination  he is found to have Osler's nodes on his fingers and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. On auscultation  a new-onset murmur is noted.   His social history reveals that he is currently unemployed  lives alone  and smokes about half a pack of cigarettes a day. He denies any recent travel  close contacts with infectious diseases  or recent surgeries or procedures. There is no history of any known heart problems or rheumatic fever. His family history is non-contributory.   Given his symptoms  and past medical and social history  there is a high suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations including blood cultures and an echocardiogram are planned to confirm the diagnosis.  Note: The typical demographic representation of patients with infective endocarditis tends to be male  middle-aged  often having a history of intravenous drug use  and frequently associated underlying conditions such as diabetes or hepatitis C infection. African Americans are over-represented among people who inject drugs in the United States  thus higher risk for native valve endocarditis has been reported.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,84,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  presenting to the hospital with complaints of persistent fevers  fatigue  chills  and an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds in the last 5 weeks.   The physical examination reveals Janeway lesions (painless erythematous lesions) on the palms. Osborne's sign (visible undulating line in the artery of the nail bed) is noticed  along with Roth's spots (retinal hemorrhages) on funduscopic examination. Fever of 101.3 F is noted. A new pan-systolic murmur of grade 3/6 is heard at the left sternal border.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use (primarily heroin)  which puts him at an elevated risk of bacterial endocarditis. He also has type II diabetes  but the patient confirms not taking any medication for it. He is a smoker with a 20 pack-year history and consumes alcohol socially. He has no known allergies.  Conclusion:  The patient's history of substance use  combined with the clinical signs  and symptoms suggest a likely case of native valve infective endocarditis. Further investigation including blood cultures and echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for any potential complications.  Note: The median age of people with infective endocarditis in developed countries is about 60 years old and two thirds of patients are men. Predisposing cardiac conditions are present in more than 50% cases with mitral valve prolapse  aortic valve disease  degenerative valve disease  and congenital heart disease being the most common. Other significant risk factors are intravenous drugs and poor dental health.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,85,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old non-Hispanic white male presents to the clinic with symptoms of generalized fatigue  intermittent fever  and unintentional weight loss over the past three weeks. He also complains of night sweats and anorexia.  Additional Details:   The patient works as a plumber. Social history shows he is a nonsmoker  consumes alcohol at social events only  and denies any illicit drug use. Family history is non-contributory.  Past Medical History:  He has a medical history of rheumatic fever which he suffered during his teenage years and was treated accordingly. He developed moderate aortic stenosis two years back. He also has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed five years ago  which is being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents.  Current Medications:  His medication list includes Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes and occasional intake of over-the-counter NSAIDs for arthralgia.  On physical exam  he is febrile  with the blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  and heart rate of 96 beats per minute (regular). Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh systolic ejection murmur over the right second intercostal space  which radiates to the neck and is suggestive of aortic stenosis. Controlled oral candidiasis is also observed on intraoral examination.  Given the patient's symptoms and his rheumatic heart disease history  the presentation is suggestive of probable infective endocarditis on native valves  and further diagnostic workup like blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are ordered.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,86,A 60-year-old African American male patient  Mr. J  presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of malaise  fevers  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds. He denies any cough  chest pain  shortness of breath  or changes in bowel or urinary habits. He has been recently discharged from a hospital two months ago after undergoing dental extraction.  This patient has a significant past medical history of intravenous drug use but has been in recovery for the past five years. He also has a history of chronic hepatitis C  untreated stage II hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He currently smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol occasionally. His medications consist of metformin for diabetes and amlodipine for hypertension. He is inconsistent with his medication regimen and often misses doses. He does not have any known drug allergies.  On physical examination  his blood pressure is 150/95 mm HG  pulse is 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute  and temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Cardiac examination reveals a new murmur on the mitral area. He also exhibits Osler's Nodes on his fingers and toes and Janeway Lesions on the palms and soles.  Given his history and physical findings  there is strong suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis  potentially secondary to poor dental hygiene or non-compliance with the prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis recommended during his recent dental extraction. Further tests and management are needed to confirm the diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,87,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian Male  presenting with a 2-week history of intermittent high-grade fever accompanied by persistent fatigue and marked weight loss. For the last few days  he has been having intense night sweats and a loss of appetite. He also mentions an increased discomfort and cloudiness in his vision.  Patient's past medical history reveals that he was a long-term intravenous drug user but has been sober for the last 3 years. He has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and has undergone a mitral valve repair surgery 5 years ago.  Social history revealed that he works as a construction worker with exposure to dust and airborne particles. He is a chronic smoker with a 30-pack year history. On examination  pallor is present with the patient appearing acutely ill. Cardiac examination reveals a new-onset murmur heard best at the apex of the heart.   There is evidence of splinter hemorrhages under the fingernails and Janeway lesions are visualized on the palms and soles. The funduscopic exam reveals Roth spots. His vital signs are: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  heart rate of 120 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  oral temperature of 39°C  and oxygen saturation around 94% on room air.  Recent blood results show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with normal white blood cells (WBC) count  suggestive of an ongoing systemic inflammatory response due to possible infection. Given his symptoms and clinical findings  a probable diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered. This needs significant investigation like echocardiography and blood culture for confirmation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,88,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Amaechi Nnabueze  a 62-year-old African male  visits the hospital complaining of fatigue  chills  night sweats  shortness of breath  and unexplained weight loss for the past 2-3 weeks.   Relevant Medical History: Mr. Nnabueze  previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2  for which he monitors his blood sugar level regularly and takes metformin. He has a 25-year history of IV drug abuse but has been in a recovery program and sober for one year.  Examination: On physical examination  there were signs of nail bed hemorrhages and Osler nodes on his fingers and toes  suggesting embolic events and immune-mediated phenomena. A grade II/VI systolic heart murmur audible at the left lower sternal border was also noticed.  Laboratory finding: Blood cultures taken showed Streptococcus viridans. Given his clinical condition  echocardiogram findings  and blood culture results  the diagnosis of infective endocarditis of native valves was made.   Note: According to literature  the male to female ratio for infective endocarditis is 2:1  with African individuals being disproportionately affected. The high prevalence among Africans is believed to be in part related to higher rates of rheumatic heart disease. Moreover  diabetes is also a risk factor for developing infective endocarditis. In the U.S.  there's a higher rate of infective endocarditis among individuals with a history of IV drug use. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,89,Patient Presentation  Patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male  with a history of intravenous drug use  presenting with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  and unplanned weight loss. Denies any recent travel or contact with sick individuals. His past medical history is significant for intra-venous drug use  Hepatitis C  and HIV  for which he is following treatment.  Last used intravenous drugs about a month ago  but denies any needle sharing. He has been in recovery for past few years  but experienced multiple relapses. He is unemployed  lives alone  and has unstable housing conditions. No known allergies.   On physical examination  temperature is 100.4 F  pulse 90/min  blood pressure 92/60 mmHg  respiratory rate 20/min  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. There are small erythematous lesions on his palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions. Auscultation of heart reveals a new murmur on the left lower sternal border  suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation. No osler nodes are noted.   This history and clinical presentation lead to a preliminary diagnosis of infective endocarditis  likely due to his high-risk behavior of intravenous drug use. Further investigation including blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiogram were planned for confirmation. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,90,Patient Presentation:  A 61-year-old African American male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use and untreated diabetes mellitus presents with a one-month history of fever  malaise  and unintentional weight loss. He also reports a new onset persistent cough over the past 2 weeks.   On physical examination  he appears ill  tired  and is notably underweight for his height. Vital signs show a persistent low-grade fever at 100.4℉  blood pressure at 135/85 mmHg  heart rate at 100 beats per minute  and respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute. His dentition is poor  and he admits to not visiting a dentist for several years. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur heard best at left lower sternal border. Neurological examination reveals an unsteady gait but no focal deficits. Small  dark  linear hemorrhages are present beneath the nails of his fingers and toes.  Labs are significant for anemia  elevated inflammatory markers (ESR: 70mm/hr  CRP: 80 mg/L)  and blood cultures reveal growth of Streptococcus viridans. His HbA1c is 9.5%  indicating poor glycemic control.   Echocardiography reveals vegetations on the mitral valve  pointing towards a diagnosis of native-valve bacterial endocarditis  likely resulting from his chronic IV drug use and poor oral hygiene. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,91,Patient Presentation:  Gender: Male Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. J  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  visits the clinic complaining of recurrent low-grade fever (up to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) with accompanying intermittent chills and night sweats for the past three weeks. He also reports a lack of appetite  fatigue  and weight loss of approximately ten pounds during the same period due to reduced appetite and general malaise. He further notes experiencing moderate exertional dyspnea and a persistent mild-to-moderate headache.  Past Medical History:   Mr. J has a known history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease due to diabetes mellitus type 2 for the past 10 years. He has hypertension which is controlled with medication. Furthermore  he underwent a balloon mitral valvuloplasty ten years ago for symptomatically significant mitral stenosis. He is under regular medical follow-ups and is compliant with his medications  including metformin  lisinopril  and amlodipine.   Social History:  Mr. J recently retired. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 15 years ago. He occasionally drinks alcohol. He is living with his wife and has not traveled recently. His vaccinations  including the pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines  are updated.  Family History:  There's a family history of cardiovascular diseases - father had coronary artery disease and mother had hypertension. There's no family history of autoimmune or hematological diseases.  This patient's age  gender  caucasian ethnicity  and past medical history of cardiac and renal disease are inline with typical demographic characteristics found in literature associated with patients with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Given his symptoms and past medical history  he is being evaluated further with suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. β-hemolytic streptococcal blood cultures  Staphylococcal cultures  CBC  ESR  CRP  EKG and transthoracic echocardiography are ordered.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,92,Patient Information:  Age: 55-year-old  Sex: Male Occupation: Construction Worker Lifestyle: History of intravenous drug use (last 10 years  currently in recovery). Race: White (according to literature  Infective Endocarditis is most common in white individuals.)  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a three-week history of intermittent  low-grade fever (up to 100.4° F)  night sweats  weight loss  and fatigue.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history positive for Intravenous Drug Use (IVUD)  Hepatitis C (currently under treatment)  and is a known case of valvular heart disease  which was diagnosed 5 years ago. The patient is currently under the management of a cardiologist and has been advised surgery for his valve replacement but has been deferring it. He doesn't have any known allergies. He denies any alcohol consumption but admits to smoking about a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 25 years.  Physical Examination: Vital signs within normal limits except for mild tachycardia. Examination reveals venipuncture marks consistent with a history of intravenous drug use. Janeway lesions (non-tender hemorrhagic lesions on palms and soles) and Osler nodes (painful nodules on the pads of the fingers) are seen. Auscultation reveals a regurgitant murmur indicative of valvular regurgitation.  Investigations: Blood tests indicate leukocytosis and elevated CRP. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram reveals the presence of vegetative growth on the tricuspid valve.  Impression: Based on the clinical presentation  past medical history  and laboratory findings  a diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis is made. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,2,93,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Ms. M.  is a 70-year-old Caucasian woman who came to the hospital complaining of low-grade fever  intermittent  unusual sweating  and malaise for the last three months. She also reported experiencing unintentional weight loss and an unexplainable feeling of fatigue in the same period. She recently noticed red  painful sores on her fingers and toes and distinct dark red/brownish spots on her palms and soles.  Details of her past medical history revealed that she has a history of rheumatic heart disease after being diagnosed at the age of 12. Additionally  she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 5 years ago and has been taking anticoagulant medication ever since. The patient doesn't have any history of IV drug use or any immunosuppressive conditions. However  she recently underwent a dental procedure without any antibiotic prophylaxis.   Overall  her longstanding history of heart disease  presence of atrial fibrillation  and recent dental procedure  combined with the new onset of generalized symptoms like fatigue  low-grade fever  sweating  and skin lesions collectively raise suspicion for infective endocarditis. Given her medical history and current symptoms  blood cultures and an echocardiogram are recommended for further evaluation.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,5,Title: Infective Endocarditis - A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction Today we'll be discussing a case of native-valve infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves caused typically by bacteria. Native valve endocarditis refers to infection of a patient's own  unaltered heart valves.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mr. R  is a 52-year-old Caucasian male  which fits within the demographic mainly affected by native valve infective endocarditis based on current literature. The condition commonly afflicts middle-aged to older adults  with a higher prevalence in males.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. R has a history of type 2 diabetes managed with medication and lifestyle modifications. He also has a history of intravenous drug abuse – a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis. He's been in methadone maintenance treatment for the past five years.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  He presented to the hospital with a two-week history of malaise  low-grade fever  and a new heart murmur. He also exhibited signs of Osler’s nodes on his hands and feet  petechiae on his legs  Janeway lesions  and splinter hemorrhages under the nails – classical systemic presentations of infective endocarditis.  Slide 5: Diagnosis  His blood cultures tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus  pointing towards MRSA-associated infective endocarditis due to his history of intravenous drug use. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the presence of vegetations on his mitral valve  corroborating the diagnosis.  Slide 6: Treatment  Mr. R was administered IV antibiotics - vancomycin and ceftriaxone for a 6-week course. Due to the large vegetations affecting his heart function  he underwent successful surgical removal of the infected valve and valve replacement surgery.  Slide 7: Follow-up  His post-operative recovery has been steady with regular follow-ups being scheduled for monitoring his cardiac status and the control of his diabetes.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case illustrates the potential severity of infective endocarditis  especially in patients with a past medical history of intravenous drug use. Early detection and prompt treatment are critical to minimize complications  enforce the vital role of heart function assessments  and underscore the necessity for life-long disease management in individuals with increased risk profiles.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,7,Title: A Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Patient Demographics We present the case of a 62-year-old African American male patient  Mr. A. Based on literature  infective endocarditis (IE) is more common among males in their 60's and African Americans tend to be disproportionately affected due to a variety of systemic factors - socioeconomic  healthcare access  etc.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. A has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) during his youth  though he has been clean for about 20 years. He is hypertensive and has stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). He also has a history of rheumatic heart disease with moderate valvular disease. These comorbidities increase his risk for developing IE  particularly given the valvular heart damage from rheumatic heart disease.  Slide 3: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE) A week prior to admission  Mr. A experienced upfront symptoms of fever and fatigue  later developing into more alarming signs like petechiae  Osler's nodes  and Janeway lesions. After a serological study  he was found to have Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia  and an echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the native mitral valve.  Slide 4: Further Investigations Blood cultures revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Absence of illicit drug use  normal immunity status  and echocardiographic findings provoked us to consider Mr. A's history of rheumatic heart disease as possible gateway leading to native-valve IE. Further investigations were directed towards leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response.  Slide 5: Management and Prognosis IE  especially with a highly virulent organism like S. aureus  in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease is a grave condition. After confirming the diagnosis of native-valve IE  Mr. A was initiated on empiric antibiotic therapy and closely monitored for any signs of heart failure or embolic events. The need for surgery will depend on the patient's sequential clinical and echocardiographic evaluations.  Slide 6: Conclusion This case highlights the significance of comprehensive past medical history and underlines the importance of early detection and management for improving patient survival in infective endocarditis. Further  it emphasizes the ongoing need for focused strategies to reduce the rate of IE among African Americans and other vulnerable patient groups.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,9,Slide 1: Introduction   Title: A Case Study of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 2: Demographics   Our patient  Mr. J  is a 60-year-old Caucasian male born in the United States. He is married and has two adult children. He is retired and enjoys golfing and reading in his spare time. He lives in a suburban area with his wife and has good access to healthcare facilities.  Slide 3: Demographic Representation   The choice of a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient aligns with previous studies indicating that endocarditis typically affects males more than females  with Caucasian males being predominantly affected  and that the age of onset is typically seen in older adults.  Slide 4: Past Medical History   Mr. J has a past medical history significant for rheumatic heart disease. He suffered from a bout of acute rheumatic fever when he was a child  which damaged his heart valves and increased his risk of developing infective endocarditis. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulant medication.  Slide 5: Relevant History   Mr. J had dental work done two weeks before the onset of symptoms. He reported a history of non-sterile needle use when he was a younger adult but has been sober for over 25 years.  Slide 6: Case Overview   In light of the patient's age  gender  and history of valvular disease combined with recent dental work  the patient's symptoms of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  and night sweats should heighten the suspicion for the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Precise demographic characteristics and a keen eye on the comprehensive medical history enable us to detect early and manage cases of native valve infective endocarditis  such as with Mr. J  potentially driving better outcomes and increased survival rates.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,10,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a serious condition characterised by the inflammation of the endocardium. It often affects the heart valves and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite current advancements in diagnostics and therapies  the incidence of NVIE remains constant.   Slide 2: Patient demographics We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male. It is important to note that NVIE has a slight male predominance with 60% to 75% of cases affecting males. The likelihood of NVIE increases with age  with most diagnoses typically coming between the ages of 30 and 60.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use (IVDU)  which is a major risk factor for NVIE. Additionally  he has a co-morbid condition of diabetes mellitus type II and previous mitral valve prolapse. Substance misuse  particularly IVDU is associated with increased risk of NVIE  with studies estimating that people with IVDU have a 5-10 times higher risk for the condition. Diabetes and valvular heart disease are other contributing factors.  Slide 4: Presentation and Diagnosis The patient was admitted to the hospital with malaise  weight loss and fever over three weeks. Due to his medical history  blood cultures were immediately conducted  and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed which revealed large vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of NVIE.  Slide 5: Treatment and Prognosis The management plan included aggressive antibiotic therapy. Because of the large vegetations  the patient underwent mitral valve replacement surgery. However  the mortality rate for NVIE remains high due to complications of heart failure and systemic embolization  emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and aggressive treatment.  Slide 6: Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and aggressive treatment of NVIE. Risk factors like age  IVDU  and mitral valve prolapse increase the patient's susceptibility to this condition. Therefore  early diagnosis with prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics and  where necessary  surgery are crucial to improving outcomes in NVIE.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,13,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 2: Patient Demographic Information  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  mirroring literature that states that this condition often affects older people more frequently  specifically in their sixth decade of life. Males are also more likely to develop infective endocarditis as compared to females.   Slide 3: Occupational & Social History  The patient is a retired manual worker and former smoker. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption  but he has been sober for the past five years. No history of intravenous drug use.   Slide 4: Past Medical History  The patient has a significant medical history  including hypertension  controlled diabetes mellitus type II  and periodontal disease. He had a dental procedure approximately six weeks prior to his diagnosis.  Slide 5: Relevant Past Medical History & Pathophysiology  Patients with a past medical history of heart valve dysfunction or damage  whether from a congenital condition or from previous rheumatic fever  are at a higher risk for infective endocarditis. Additionally  periodontal disease and dental procedures have been implicated in spreading bacteria through the bloodstream to the heart valves. Diabetes and alcohol use can also weaken the immune system  increasing susceptibility to infection.  Slide 6: Clinical Presentation  The patient presented with a three-week onset of malaise  weight loss  and intermittent fever. Physical examination revealed a new-onset heart murmur and mild splenomegaly. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  a common causative agent of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Diagnostic Procedure & Results   An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Slide 8: Treatment & Prognosis  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent mitral valve replacement surgery. He is expected to undergo prolonged antibiotic therapy and regular follow-ups with his cardiologist to minimize the risk of complications in the future.  Slide 9: Conclusion   Infective endocarditis is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality  requiring early detection and aggressive treatment. Understanding the risk factors and being aware of possible nonspecific presenting symptoms in vulnerable populations can aid in early detection and improved outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,14,**Title:** A Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Demographics and Introduction Our patient  Mr. Johnson  is a Caucasian male aged 65 years. The increased prevalence of native valve infective endocarditis in older adults is due to degenerative changes that occur in heart valves as part of the natural process of ageing.  Slide 2: Past Medical History A known case of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension  Mr. Johnson also has a history of dental treatment procedures without any prophylactic antibiotics. He was treated for H. Pylori-induced peptic ulcer disease 4 years ago. Diabetes and previous dental procedures have been documented as risk factors for native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 3: Present Complaints Mr. Johnson presented with one week of worsening malaise  intermittent fever  and night sweats. Self-recorded blood glucose levels have elevated recently. A low-grade fever with concomitant signs and symptoms often raises suspicion towards infective endocarditis.  Slide 4: Physical Examination On examination  he had a diastolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. There were unexplained petechiae on his palms and soles  and Janeway's lesions on pupils. These are classic signs in native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 5: Investigations Upon initial investigations  there was leukocytosis suggestive of an ongoing infection  and ESR was also raised. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a vegetative growth on the Mitral valve  highly suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan The treatment plan included intravenous antibiotic therapy as per blood culture sensitivity results under infectious disease guidance  aggressive glycaemic control  continuation of antihypertensive therapy  lifestyle modifications  and appropriate prophylaxis prior to future dental procedures. Valve surgery was not considered immediately due to the absence of heart failure and the patient being stable.  Slide 7: Case Summary This case highlights the higher susceptibility of native-valve infective endocarditis in older adults  particularly those with diabetes  a history of untreated dental procedures  and diagnosed valve conditions. Early detection through critical interpretation of signs and symptoms is crucial  as delayed diagnosis could have severe implications. The treatment primarily involves managing the bacterial infection  with potential surgery based upon the patient's clinical status.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,27,"Title: """"A Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis""""  Slide 1: Introduction Today  we present a relatively common yet high-risk case of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). Our focus is on a significant demographic group representative of this health issue as reported in the latest literature.  Slide 2: Case Demographics Our patient  who we'll refer to as Mr. A  falls in line with the typical demographic associated with NVIE. He is a 61-year-old Caucasian male  a smoker with a history of intravenous drug use. While infective endocarditis also occurs in young individuals with congenital heart disease  the literature suggests that NVIE most frequently occurs in males  aged between 50-70 years  with a medical history of intravenous drug use or poor dental health.  Slide 3: Medical History Mr. A has a previously diagnosed Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)  a condition statistically linked to a higher chance of acquiring NVIE. His background of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (Stage 3) presents additional complications. He has a past record of intravenous drug usage; however  he has been sober for the past ten years.   Slide 4: Presentation and Symptoms Mr. A presented with a 3-week history of unintended weight loss  fatigue  low-grade fever of 100.4°F  and nightly sweats. He reported shortness of breath and chest pain  which escalated with physical activity. He had no reported change in his urination habits  and denied headache or changes in vision or hearing.  Slide 5: Conclusion With the privilege of hindsight and confirmed blood cultures  Mr. A is a textbook representation of NVIE. His case underlines the importance of considering NVIE in differential diagnoses  particularly in patients presenting with similar age  background  medical history  and nondescript  generalized symptoms.  Slide 6: Learnings Remember - NVIE is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality even with treatment  requiring early diagnosis and aggressive therapy. An understanding of the demographic and clinical profile of patients with NVIE  as exemplified by Mr. A  is vital for quick  accurate diagnosis  and intervention.   (Note: Depending upon the time available for presentations  additional slides can be added to address the diagnostic procedures  lab findings  treatment plan  outcome  and strategies for patient education/prevention regarding NVIE.)"

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,31,Title: A Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Overview Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Today  we'll discuss a case representing the typical demographic and clinical profile of these patients  as outlined in medical literature.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 59-year-old Caucasian male  as the majority of native-valve endocarditis cases tend to be in middle-aged to elderly males. He is a resident in an urban area  which entails increased exposure to bacteria causing endocarditis due to the higher population density.   Slide 3: History of Presenting Illness The patient presented with a 2-week history of fever  fatigue  and weight loss. He also reported a new onset of back pain. On examination  he had a new regurgitant murmur  signaling possible valvular disease.   Slide 4: Past Medical History He has a history of mild hypertension  a common co-morbidity in patients with IE. However  he denies any prior history of illicit drug use  surgical interventions  dental procedures  or infectious diseases  which are significant risk factors for the development of IE.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Approach Upon suspicion of IE  we ordered blood cultures  which returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus  a common causative organism in native-valve IE. An echocardiogram revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the mitral valve  confirming our diagnosis.  Slide 6: Management and Follow-Up Following Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines  the patient was started on empiric antibiotic treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin. Surgery was not immediately necessary as there were no complications like heart failure or persistent sepsis. The patient will require careful follow-up to monitor treatment response and detect potential complications early.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case is representative of a typical native-valve IE patient in mainstream literature. Increasing awareness about early diagnosis and management can significantly improve patients' prognosis  reducing long-term complications and improving quality of life. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,32,Title: A Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a serious cardiovascular infection with significant morbidity and mortality.  Slide 2: Demographics: Prevalence and Population at Risk  According to the literature  NVIE affects approximately 15 000 – 20 000 people per year in the United States. Incidence rates increase with age  with highest rates seen in those above 60 years. Although NVIE can affect all demographics  there is a slightly higher risk in males  presenting a male-to-female ratio of 2:1.   Slide 3: Case Presentation: Patient Information  Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  presenting with malaise  fever  and night sweats.   Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has a significant history of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis for which he has been taking methotrexate. He also has a history of moderate alcohol abuse but has been abstinent for the past 5 years. He has no history of IV drug use  heart surgery  or congenital heart disease. There is also no history of recent dental procedures or invasive medical interventions.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation Given the patient's systemic symptoms  advanced age  and the presence of a known risk factor - rheumatoid arthritis treated with an immunosuppressive agent  a differential diagnosis of NVIE was considered  highlighting the need for further diagnostic investigations.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,39,Title: A Case Study on Native-valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Introduction Infective Endocarditis is a rare yet life-threatening infection and inflammation of the inner layer of the heart  most typically affecting the heart valves. For this presentation  we delve into a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 2: Demographic Details Our patient is a retired  72-year-old Caucasian male living in a suburban area. He lives with his wife and is a nonsmoker. Historically  Infective Endocarditis has been observed more frequently in males and is uncommon in people under 50 unless they have a history of intravenous drug use.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a known history of Hypertension  managed with antihypertensive drugs. He is also known to have mild Hyperlipidemia. He had a pacemaker implanted six years ago due to third-degree atrioventricular block. No previous history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease  intravenous drug use  dental infections  and no recent surgical procedures could be traced.  Slide 4: Recent Symptoms & Visit to the Clinic The patient presented with persistent  low-grade fever for nearly three weeks. Accompanied by generalized weakness  a decreased appetite  and some weight loss. He also complained about a new-onset regurgitating type chest discomfort.  Slide 5: Examination & Diagnosis Initial physical examination revealed heart murmur consistent with mitral valve regurgitation along with Janeway lesions on palms and soles. Lab investigations showed elevated ESR  CRP  and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis was confirmed with an echocardiogram  showing vegetations on the native mitral valve.  Slide 6: Management Plan Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Cefazolin was initiated  considering the patient's age  organism causing infection  and susceptibilities. Valve repair surgery was discussed due to severe mitral insufficiency but deferred considering the patient's overall condition and choice.  Slide 7: Conclusion The need for active surveillance  early recognition  and prompt intervention in infective endocarditis is crucial due to its potentially fatal outcomes. In a largely aging population like our patient's demographic  any persistent signs of infection coupled with symptoms suggestive of valve dysfunction should warrant an investigation for endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,43,Title: Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction This case study profiles a patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Our objective is to familiarize ourselves with the patient's demographics and past medical history relative to this condition  as reported in existing literature.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  reflecting the fact that infective endocarditis is most frequently reported among males and tends to occur at a median age of about 57.8 years. The patient's background includes mid-level socioeconomic status and a history of minimal alcohol consumption.   Slide 3: Common Risk Factors  The patient’s past medical history reveals twice-daily intravenous drug use  a predominant risk factor for developing endocarditis  particularly in a native valve. It's vital to note  at least 10% of patients with infective endocarditis use intravenous drugs.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  another independent risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis. Moreover  he has a past history of hypertension and aortic valve disease  both of which can contribute to the development of endocarditis.  Slide 5: Previous Cardiac History Our patient underwent aortic valve replacement 10 years ago but developed stenosis over time  which increases the risk of infective endocarditis. Postoperative complications after valve replacement surgery are a challenge and need careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up.  Slide 6: Symptomatic Presentation Long-term symptoms include fever  anorexia  weight loss  and persistent fatigue. Other acute manifestations were chills  arthralgias  and systemic embolism signs  suggesting infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Blood Culture and Echocardiogram The patient underwent blood cultures  which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus  a common causative agent in infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram showed vegetation on the native aortic valve.  Slide 8: Conclusion Recognizing infective endocarditis in patients with a medical history like our subject’s is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. Appropriate antibiotic regimen and cardiac monitoring are key to better outcomes in these cases. By understanding this demographic  we can better implement preventive education and interventions.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,50,Title: A Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection of the endocardial surface of the heart that primarily affects the heart valves. Associated with significant morbidity and mortality  this condition is most prevalent among males and the elderly.  Slide 2: Case Introduction Today  we will be discussing the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. A  which follows the demographic patterns seen in published literature.  Slide 3: Demographic Overview Mr. A aligns with the typical age and gender demographic for native-valve IE  with men over 60 being the most frequently affected according to literature.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Mr. A has a history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) without regurgitation  no other congenital heart defects  and no history of intravenous drug use. He also has a known history of moderate alcohol consumption and stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both MVP and CKD are known predisposing factors to IE.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms Mr. A presented to the hospital ER with a 3-week history of intermittent fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  fatigue  and a recent onset of confusion. These are all non-specific but common symptoms of endocarditis.  Slide 6: Clinical Assessment Upon physical examination  Mr. A exhibited finger clubbing  Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  and a new murmur suggestive of mitral valve regurgitation - classic signs of IE.  Slide 7: Diagnostic Evaluation Confirming IE involved a combination of blood cultures  which came back positive for Streptococcus viridans; an echocardiogram showed vegetation on the mitral valve  consistent with the diagnosis.  Slide 8: Conclusion Mr. A’s case serves as an important reminder of the potential severity and systemic nature of native-valve IE  as well as the demographic trends of the disease. His past medical history and presenting symptoms are common in IE cases and underline the importance of considering IE as a differential in similar patient presentations.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,51,Title: A Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Introduction Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a serious infection of the heart's native (original) valves. NVIE is most common in older males with a history of degenerative valve disease  intravenous drug use  or a previous history of infective endocarditis.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics The patient in consideration is a 66-year-old Caucasian male  representative of the high incidence rate of NVIE found amongst older individuals and males in literature. He's retired and lives in a suburban area.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a past medical history significant for mitral valve prolapse – a degenerative valve disease  and previous heart surgery conducted about 7 years ago. He also has a history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and hyperlipidemia but these are well-controlled.  Slide 4: Lifestyle Factors The patient is not an intravenous drug user and abstains from alcohol or smoking. His BMI is slightly elevated at 26  indicating mild overweight.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms The patient reported a two-week history of intermittent low-grade fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also complained of dyspnea on exertion and occasional night sweats.  Slide 6: Clinical Investigation Initial blood cultures indicate the presence of streptococci  the most common causative agent for NVIE. An echocardiogram showed vegetations on the mitral valve  supporting our diagnosis.   Slide 7: Conclusion Finally  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He was immediately started on an antibiotic treatment regimen  subject to further speciation and susceptibility testing of the cultured bacteria.   Slide 8: Future Considerations Due to his advanced age and history of heart surgery  treatment will need to be carefully monitored to prevent further complications. The potential for valve replacement surgery will be assessed as his treatment progresses. Lifestyle modifications  such as weight management and regular physical exercise  will be advised to promote overall health and reduce future risks.   Note: This is a fictional case for educational purposes. Treatment planning should be based on individual patient conditions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,52,Title: Case Study of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart which typically affects the cardiac valves. Demographically  it is common in males aged 50-70  often with a history of intravenous drug use or pre-existing cardiac conditions.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Patient X is a 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use and moderately severe mitral valve regurgitation  living in an urban environment. He has a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and is a regular smoker.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Patient X was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 twenty years ago  being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of smoking for thirty years  leading to Mild-to-Moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. His history as an intravenous drug user puts him at a high risk for diseases like Hepatitis C  for which he had been treated ten years ago. His mitral valve regurgitation was diagnosed five years ago and has been managed non-operatively with medication.  Slide 4: Present Illness  Recently  the patient has been experiencing recurrent bouts of fever  malaise  and night sweats  predominantly nocturnal  associated with weight loss. He also complains of shortness of breath that has progressively increased over the past two weeks.   Slide 5: Clinical Examination & Diagnosis  Physical examination reveals pallor  clubbing in fingers  and pre-existing cardiac conditions  including a heart murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  and Transthoracic Echocardiography showed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of NVIE.  Slide 6: Discussion & Relevance   It is crucial to be vigilant about NVIE in patients like ours with a history of intravenous drug use or prior mitral valve pathology. Quick diagnosis  accurate treatment  and control of predisposing factors can improve outcomes and reduce the high mortality rate associated with NVIE.  Slide 7: Management Plan  Patient X should immediately start on intravenous bactericidal antibiotics. Cardiology consultation is also needed for ongoing care  and surgery will be considered if complications like heart failure arise  or if the infection does not clear.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case highlights the importance of recognizing the risk factors and clinical features of NVIE  and the need for a prompt  multidisciplinary intervention to reduce its high morbidity and mortality rates.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,53,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. The disease predominantly affects men (60-70% of cases)  with a peak age incidence between 30-60 years.  Slide 2: Demographics Patient X  a 40-year-old Caucasian man  presents persistent fever and has lost a significant amount of weight over the past two months.   Slide 3: Past Medical History He has a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use  having been clean for five years. Additionally  the patient has history of heart disease  specifically aortic valve regurgitation  but no prosthetic valves.   Slide 4: Current Presentation  Recently  the patient has been struggling with malaise  night sweats  and occasional shortness of breath. On examination  he showed signs of Osler's nodes (painful nodules on the pads of the fingers and toes) and Janeway lesions (painless  flat  erythematous spots on the palms and soles).   Slide 5: Diagnostic Results Blood cultures return positive for Staphylococcus aureus  a common causative bacterium in native-valve IE  particularly amongst intravenous drug users. An echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the patient's native aortic valve.  Slide 6: Discussion Patient X's history of heart disease and intravenous drug use significantly increase his risk for native-valve infective endocarditis. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in his bloodstream  his clinical signs and symptoms  and the echo findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of IE.  Slide 7: Treatment Plan  The patient will likely require hospitalization for 4-6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. A multidisciplinary discussion  including a cardiothoracic surgeon  will be important to assess whether surgical intervention is required to treat the patient's aortic valve disease and endocarditis.   Slide 8: Conclusion and Discussion Early recognition and treatment of IE is critical in improving patient outcomes. This case highlights the importance of considering endocarditis in patients presenting with systemic symptoms and a relevant past medical history  especially those with previous valve disease or a history of drug use. The presentation concludes with a discussion on treatment approach and the crucial role of multidisciplinary teams in managing these patients.   Thank you  for your attention.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,63,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Case Presentation: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient  Slide 2: Demographics and Epidemiology Infective endocarditis (IE) commonly affects adult men over the age of 60  with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. This case focuses on the fictitious but representative patient  Mr. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  living in the United States.   Slide 3: Preliminary Information  Mr. J is a retired engineer  non-smoker  and socially drinks alcohol. He reports no recreational drug use  which is crucial since intravenous drug use is a significant risk factor for IE.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Mr. J's documented history includes systolic heart failure and aortic valve stenosis  yet no prior surgeries. These underlying cardiac conditions increase his risk for native-valve IE  as damaged valves present preferred sites for bacterial adherence.  Slide 5: Current Presentation  Mr. J visited the ER with complaints of fatigue  unintentional weight loss  and low-grade fevers over the past few weeks. Symptoms like these  which are often nonspecific  can delay the diagnosis of IE.   Slide 6: Examination and Investigation  Upon examination  Mr. J had a systolic murmur audible at the right upper sternal border. The initial lab tests were significant for elevated inflammatory markers (ESR  CRP) and slight normocytic anemia.  Slide 7: Intravenous Treatment and Blood Cultures  Mr. J was started empirically on broad-spectrum antibiotics  after having blood cultures drawn. The blood culture confirmed the presence of Streptococcus viridans  a common causative organism in native-valve endocarditis.   Slide 8: The Challenge of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Given his demographics and heart history  Mr. J's case represents a typical profile for a native-valve IE patient. The subtle clues in his presentation underline the challenges in diagnosing IE promptly and highlight the importance of considering IE in patients with atypical symptoms yet significant cardiac history.   Slide 9: Conclusion  Thorough understanding of demographics and distinct clinical presentations can facilitate early detection of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  a serious cardiac disease requiring immediate intervention to prevent complications such as stroke  heart failure  or even death.   Slide 10: References Selected references pertaining to the study and demographics of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,64,Title: A Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Case Identification  Joseph Anderson  a 57-year-old African-American male farmer from a rural area  has presented with a two-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  fatigue  mild headache  and unexpected weight loss.   Slide 2: Demographics and Incidence   Infective endocarditis historically has a higher incidence rate in males when compared to females. The disease is most common in individuals aged 30 to 60 years old and the incidence appears to increase with age. Statistics from the literature indicate a higher prevalence among African-Americans.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr. Anderson was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his childhood  for which he underwent surgical correction. He has a 10-year history of controlled hypertension and is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption. He had a dental procedure performed approximately a month ago.   Slide 4: Preconditions and Risk Factors    It is important to note that Mr. Anderson’s previous heart condition places him at a higher risk for infective endocarditis. Moreover  the recent dental procedure can also be a potential source of bacteria causing infective endocarditis. Individuals with such predisposing factors and exposure should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of the disease.  Slide 5: Medical Examination   Upon detailed examination  Janeway lesions were present on the palms and soles. His temperature was averaged at 38.5°C (101.3°F). Labs revealed anemia  raised ESR  positive blood cultures  and echocardiography identified vegetations on the native values.  Slide 6: Diagnosis and Treatment  The presentation  history  and medical investigations led to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Mr. Anderson was promptly started on antibiotic therapy  as per the current infective endocarditis management guidelines. Regular monitoring of his clinical and hemodynamic status will determine the need for possible surgical intervention.  Slide 7: Key Takeaway   Early recognition of infective endocarditis  especially in patients with predisposing factors  is crucial for timely initiation of appropriate treatment and prevention of potential complications. Diverse demographic representation in case studies allows for a better understanding and management of the disease in various population subgroups.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,65,[Slide 1]  Title Slide:  Presentation: A Case Study on Native-valve Infective Endocarditis   Presenter: [Your Name]  [Slide 2]  Title: Introduction  Infective endocarditis is a potentially lethal disease that has undergone major changes in both host and pathogen. The epidemiology of infective endocarditis has shifted and it now affects an older patient population  with common risk factors being degenerative valve disease and health care exposure including intravascular device-related infections.  [Slide 3]  Title: Patient Demographics  Male Gender  62 years old  African American race  Detailed investigations have corroborated that native-valve infective endocarditis is more frequent among older adults aged above 60. Literature also indicates a slightly higher prevalence in males and the African American race.  [Slide 4]  Title: Past Medical History  Our patient has a pertinent past medical history of: - Degenerative Valve Disease - Type II Diabetes - Hypertension - Long-term intravascular catheter use due to dialysis for chronic kidney disease   [Slide 5]  Title: Presenting Complaint  The patient presented with a 1-week history of low-grade fever  increased fatigue  exertional dyspnea  and a new heart murmur.   [Slide 6]  Title: Clinical & Laboratory findings   Our patient has classic symptoms  and blood cultures confirmed the presence of bacteria -Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram showed vegetations on native valves indicating Native-valve Infective Endocarditis.   [Slide 7]  Title: Conclusion  Our patient faces a common but serious infectious disease related to his age  his degenerative valve disease  and chronic intravascular devices for dialysis. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are vital in reducing the potentially life-threatening complications.  [Slide 8]  Title: Treatment Plan  Treatment includes a course of specific antibiotics and surgical treatment in some cases. We should also consider specialized care for the management of co-morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension.  [Slide 9]  Title: Case Discussion & Lessons  Here we discuss essential points from the case  what we can learn from it  and how to apply these learnings to future similar scenarios.                            
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,66,SLIDE 1: Introduction  Title: Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  We present a case of a 60-year-old white male patient with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  SLIDE 2: Demographic Representation & Background  Historically  infective endocarditis has been most commonly observed in men aged between 60-65 years. Our patient is a part of this demographic majority. Infective endocarditis is also more prevalent in individuals with a history of IVDU. White individuals are disproportionately affected by this condition.  SLIDE 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a lengthy medical history  including:  - History of Intravenous Drug Use: This is a significant risk factor for native valve endocarditis. - Chronic Hepatitis C: This is a common co-morbidity in patients with a history of IVDU. Hepatitis C can contribute to a greater risk of bacterial endocarditis. - Diabetes Type II: Another risk factor for endocarditis  this may potentially contribute to immune system dysfunction.  SLIDE 4: Present Illness & Diagnosis  The patient presented with symptoms including fever  chills  and fatigue for two weeks. Physical examination revealed a new murmur and additional findings consistent with endocarditis  such as Osler's nodes and Janeway lesions. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram displayed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  SLIDE 5: Treatment & Outcome  The patient was initiated on intravenous antibiotics in the hospital. He required surgical intervention due to the large vegetations on the mitral valve. The patient's recovery was complicated by septic pulmonary emboli arising from the infected valve  a common complication for individuals with this condition.  SLIDE 6: Discussion & Conclusion  Endocarditis remains a critical concern in public health  especially for those with predisposing risk factors such as IVDU and diabetes. Rigorous infection control  surveillance  and treatment strategies for populations at risk can lead to early diagnosis and improved outcome.  By anchoring medical education in real-world cases like this  we can better understand the variety of patient experiences and the influence of risk factors like demographic characteristics and past medical history.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,70,Title: A Presentation on a Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we are examining a case of a 61-year-old male patient  Mr. Brown who presents with native-valve infective endocarditis. This condition predominantly affects males aged 50-70 per the literature  which is consistent with Mr. Brown's profile.  Slide 2: Demographics    Mr. Brown is Caucasian  retired  comes from middle socio-economic status  and lives within a suburban setting. Literature indicates that infective endocarditis has a higher prevalence amongst Caucasians.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr. Brown has a history of degenerative heart valve disease  was a smoker for 25years but quit 10 years ago  he occasionally consumes alcohol  and leads a moderately sedentary lifestyle. His family history indicates heart disease in his parents.  Slide 4: Past Medical History (Additional factors)    None of Mr. Brown's regular medication include immunosuppressants. He had a dental procedure performed two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms without antibiotic prophylaxis  which can be a risk factor.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation   Mr. Brown has been reporting symptoms including fever  chills  night sweats  fatigability  loss of appetite  and unexplained weight loss over the past week  which is considered a typical presentation in clinical practice.  Slide 6: Physical Examination    On physical examination  Mr. Brown’s heart sounds revealed a new murmur suggestive of affected heart valve. No visible signs of heart failure were found and there were no peripheral stigmata of IE.   Slide 7: Diagnostic Measures   Subsequent blood cultures confirmed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus – a common causative organism in native-valve infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetations consistent with infective endocarditis.   Slide 8: Current Status and Treatment Plan   He is currently admitted to the hospital and managed with IV antibiotics as per standard protocols for native-valve infective endocarditis. His response to treatment is being closely monitored.  Slide 9: Conclusion   We present this case to highlight the need for timely diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy in endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,71,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction   Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardial (interior) surface of the heart  typically affecting the heart valves. Although a rare disease  native valve infective endocarditis poses challenges in diagnosis and management. Given its complicated nature  it merits close study.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our case focuses on a 56-year-old Caucasian male  as literature reveals that males are more prone to this ailment and most cases occur in those aged 50-70 years.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of moderate  untreated dental decay but not any invasive procedures. He has hypertension managed by medications  and he drinks alcohol socially but does not use intravenous drugs - two factors often associated with native valve disease.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms   The patient presents with two weeks of fever and malaise. He also described a recently developed murmur. He has no significant weight loss  night sweats  nor any neurologic  respiratory  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  Slide 5: Physical Examination   Upon examination  a systolic murmur was noted. The patient had no physical stigmata of infective endocarditis (eg: Osler's nodes  Janeway's lesions  petechiae) or splenomegaly.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Measures  Blood cultures were taken  revealing Streptococcus mutans - a bacteria commonly associated with dental pathologies. An echocardiogram was carried out  showing thickening and vegetations on the mitral valve  supporting a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Discussion  According to the Modified Duke Criteria  these findings meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering infective endocarditis as a differential diagnosis in patients exhibiting fever  new murmurs and potential points of pathogen entry like dental caries.  Slide 8: Treatment & Management  The patient should be treated with targeted antibiotics as per local sensitivity patterns for S. mutans  generally including Penicillin or Amoxicillin with added Gentamycin. In case complications like heart failure or systemic emboli develop  surgery may be needed.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,77,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in An Elderly African American Male  Slide 1: Introduction This presentation aims to discuss a case involving an elderly African American male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 75-year-old African American male  a retired mechanical engineer. Citizenship status is American-born. He is on Medicare insurance  lives in an urban setting along with his wife. He's a non-smoker  and occasional alcohol drinker. This demographic is crucial as it has been reported that African Americans have a higher rate of infective endocarditis due to previous medical conditions such as rheumatic fever  valvular heart disease  etc.  Slide 3: Past Medical History His past medical history includes controlled hypertension for the last 20 years  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years. An episode of acute rheumatic fever in childhood was also recorded.  Slide 4: Infective Endocarditis History About six weeks before hospitalization  the patient began to feel fatigue  low-grade fever  and loss of appetite. His condition deteriorated over time  with the development of persistent high-grade fever and unintentional weight loss. Additionally  he noticed a new-onset cardiac murmur on examination.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings Lab tests performed on initial hospital admission showed raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus Viridans  a common agent for native-valve endocarditis. An echocardiogram illustrates vegetative growth on his mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  Slide 6: Impacts of Medical History on Current Diagnosis Earlier occurrences of rheumatic fever predisposed him to this condition  combined with his age and compromised immune system due to Type 2 Diabetes  which made him more susceptible to the infection.  Slide 7: Conclusion The patient's demographic and medical history is a textbook case of how native-valve infective endocarditis can manifest. It also emphasizes the importance of early detection and management of potential predisposing factors  such as rheumatic fever  in reducing the risk of developing this disease condition later in life. With timely diagnosis and treatment  we could prevent its potential complications  including heart failure  and systemic embolization. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,78,"Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis is an infection caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and settling in the heart lining  a heart valve  or blood vessels. Overall  infective endocarditis is rare in healthy hearts. It is more common in males than females and can occur at any age but is most common in adults 30-60 years old.   Slide 2: Case Mr. James  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  presented with a weeks-long course of unexplained fever and fatigue. Mr. James is an accountant with a past medical history of congenital heart disease  specifically bicuspid aortic valve  which puts him at a higher risk for developing infective endocarditis.   Slide 3: Pre-existing Conditions Mr. James also has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed by diet and daily Metformin  and is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago.  Slide 4: Symptoms and History Mr. James reported an initial history of low-grade fever and malaise  later developing into night sweats and unintentional weight loss over the last two weeks. He denied chest pain  cough  dyspnea  nausea  vomiting  urinary symptoms  joint pains  or skin lesions.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination On clinical examination  Mr. James has a body temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius and blood pressure of 128/87 mmHg. Heart auscultation revealed a systolic murmur at the aortic region  ophthalmoscope examination showed Roth spots  and Osler nodes seen on palms and soles.  Slide 6: Diagnosis The suspected diagnosis based on his clinical presentation was native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). This was confirmed by positive results for NVIE via echocardiography  which showed valvular vegetations  and three positive blood cultures of streptococcus viridans.  Slide 7: Conclusion Mr. James fits the demographic and medical history profile of a typical NVIE patient. Timely detection and treatment of such an infection are crucial due to potentially fatal outcomes. Follow-ups should be enforced with patients at risk to ensure monitoring and management of further infectious complications.    References:  - Infective Endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,79,Title: A Case on Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection mainly affecting the endocardial surface of the heart and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Men are more prone to this disease  and it occurs primarily among older adults.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Let's take the case of Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male. Given that the median age for people with IE is approximately 60 years and the incidence is higher among men  our patient falls into the high-risk demographic.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and aortic stenosis. A history of valvular heart disease like aortic stenosis and other chronic health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension are significant risk factors for IE.   Slide 4: Lifestyle  Mr. Smith has a history of alcohol and tobacco use  with occasional intravenous drug use till about 15 years ago. These are noteworthy as they are contributing risk factors to the disease.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms  Mr. Smith presented with a two-week history of persistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats. He has also been experiencing new-onset of shortness of breath.  Slide 6: Clinical Presentation   On physical examination  he demonstrated some key clinical signs of IE - a heart murmur suggestive of aortic valve insufficiency  Osler's nodes (painful nodules on his fingers)  and Janeway lesions (painless red lesions on his palms and soles).  Slide 7: Diagnosis  His blood culture showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus  a common organism responsible for native valve IE. This  coupled with the presence of vegetations on his aortic valve in a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)  confirmed our diagnosis.  Slide 8: Treatment  Mr. Smith was initiated on long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy per guidelines  alongside managing his chronic conditions. He is also being evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery for possible future valve replacement.  Slide 9: Conclusion  Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy are essential in managing native-valve IE to prevent severe complications like congestive heart failure  embolic events  and death. We should also focus on modifiable risk factors and patient education to prevent a recurrence.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,91,Title: Case Study of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction The purpose of this presentation is to review the case of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection of the inner layer of the heart caused by bacteria  affecting a person with no previous heart valve damage.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian man  as per the demographic distribution for infective endocarditis. The literature suggests middle-aged to older adults  particularly males  are most commonly affected. The patient lives in an urban setting in the United States and has a history of intravenous drug use.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Medical history is significant for chronic hepatitis C  attributed to past IV drug use. Non-compliance with medication has been noted. The patient also has a 20-year history of tobacco usage but quit five years ago. There is no known history of rheumatic fever  congenital heart disease  or prosthetic valves. No prior episodes of infective endocarditis were reported.  Slide 4: Infective Endocarditis History Our patient was found to have native-valve infective endocarditis after being admitted to the hospital with unexplained fever  fatigue  and weight loss. The patient had a fever of 101.8°F and complained of myalgia. He had previously been treated for pneumonia a month ago but didn't show complete recovery.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci  and echocardiography detected vegetations on the mitral valve. These findings are consistent with infective endocarditis. Clinical presentation and lab findings meet Duke's criteria for diagnosis.  Slide 6: Treatment & Follow Up  Our patient was started on IV antibiotics after the diagnosis was confirmed. Long-term management includes life-long avoidance of IV drug use and completion of antibiotic course. Follow-up will include regular echocardiograms and patient education regarding the importance of medication and treatment adherence.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case highlights the clinical presentation  diagnostic process  and management of infective endocarditis in the context of a patient's demographics and medical history.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,92,Introduction: Today we'll be discussing a clinical case of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) in a middle-aged patient.  Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 50-year-old Male  Demographics: Mr. Smith is a 50-year-old Caucasian male  an accountant by profession living in a suburban neighborhood. According to the literature  infective endocarditis has a higher incidence in males aged 30 to 60 years and in the Caucasian population.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and had suffered a minor stroke three years ago. These are significant as diabetes and hypertension may have resulted in micro-damage to the vascular endothelium  making it more susceptible to bacterial invasion. Furthermore  strokes can occur as a serious complication of infective endocarditis due to septic emboli.  He has a 20-year history of cigarette smoking  averaging one pack a day - a habit that has increased his risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases. He has shown no signs of intravenous drug use or any relevant dental history  both of which are common causes of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Clinical History: Over the last few weeks  Mr. Smith reported experiencing fluctuating fevers  chills  weakness  and unexplained weight loss. He noticed the appearance of small red or purple spots (Petechiae) on his skin and inside his mouth. A heart murmur was also observed during the medical examination  which was previously undocumented.  Based on these presentations  suspicion was high for possible infective endocarditis. Mr. Smith was immediately referred for further investigations. He went through a set of blood cultures and an echocardiogram – both standard procedures for diagnosing endocarditis.   This case represents a common presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis with predisposing factors such as diabetes and hypertension. It reinforces the need for prompt recognition and management of this serious condition  with its potential for severe complications such as stroke. It’s crucial for healthcare providers to maintain a high index of suspicion for IE in patients with a similar clinical presentation and risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,93,Title: A Case Study of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Slide 1: Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a serious infection of the endocardium (inner heart lining) that primarily affects the heart valves. This case study presents a profile of an individual most likely affected based on demographic data from the literature.  Slide 2: Demographics   Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male.  - Gender & Age: NVIE has a higher prevalence in males (about 2:1 male to female ratio) and is more common in the 60-65 age group. - Ethnicity: Literature implies a slightly elevated risk for Caucasians. However  all ethnicities can be affected.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   - Previous Cardiac Conditions: The patient has a history of mitral valve prolapse  a common risk factor for NVIE. - Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU): No history of IVDU is present. Although a significant risk factor  IVDU-associated NVIE is more common among younger age brackets.  - Dental Procedures: The patient underwent invasive dental procedures without prophylaxis  which contributively risked NVIE.   Slide 4: Recent History   In the past few weeks  the patient has presented symptoms including fever  chills  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss  all suggestive of NVIE. He also experienced shortness of breath  hinting at possible heart failure  a complication of NVIE.  Slide 5: Conclusion   This case illustrates the demographics and medical history frequently associated with NVIE. Early recognition  diagnosis  and management are crucial to improving patient outcomes.  End of Presentation.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,95,Title: A Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Infective endocarditis is a critical infection of the endothelial surface of the heart  primarily impacting the heart valves. Today  we present an archetypal case that mirrors the common demographic representation of this disease.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Meet Charlie  a 59-year-old Asian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use. Asian males around the age of 60 are underrepresented in many arenas but are overrepresented in the instance of infective endocarditis  particularly where there's a history of illicit drug use.  Slide 3: Background Charlie previously worked as a construction worker but has been unemployed for the last few years. He's a smoker with a 15-pack year history  and has been a chronic intravenous drug user for the past 25 years.  Slide 4: Previous Medical History Five years ago  Charlie was diagnosed with Hepatitis C due to his drug use. He also has a history of right-sided heart failure  adding to his increased risk for infection.  Slide 5: Presentation  Presenting Symptoms: Charlie came to the emergency department with complaints of persistent fever  night sweats  fatigue  and a new murmur noticed in a routine check-up.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on these findings  suspicion for infective endocarditis was high. Confirmation was made via blood cultures  identification of typical microorganisms (S. aureus)  and echocardiographical findings.   Slide 7: Disease Prevalence  and Impact Native-valve infective endocarditis  though rare  has severe complications and a high mortality rate  especially in older males with illicit drug use history. Charlie's case is representative of the epidemiological data.  Slide 8: Treatment and Prognosis Charlie was started on targeted antibiotic therapy following culture result  aiming for a total duration of 6 weeks. He presents a high-risk case  with potential for complications due to his age  co-existing medical conditions  and the late diagnosis.  Slide 9: Conclusion Charlie's case offers a potent reminder of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by infective endocarditis. Proper education and healthcare interventions can help prevent and manage such complicated situations for highest risk groups.   Slide 10: Questions and Discussion Time for any questions and further discussion regarding the diagnosis  management  complications  and preventive strategies of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,96,Title: A Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Patient's Demographics:  - Gender: Male - Age: 55 years old - Race: Caucasian   Past medical history: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and was identified as having Hepatitis C infection.  Slide 2: Past Medical Findings - The patient had multiple hospital admissions related to his IV drug use. - He has a known history of mild heart murmur  which  in prior evaluations  was deemed physiologic and no significant heart disease was noted.    Slide 3: Presenting Complaint The patient presented to the emergency department with persistent fever  fatigue  headache  and a new murmur on physical examination.  Slide 4: Clinical Investigations & Findings - The physical exam revealed signs associated with Endocarditis i.e.  Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions. - Lab tests: Positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus  Elevated ESR and C-Reactive Protein  - Electrocardiogram: High-degree atrioventricular block - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): evidenced vegetations on the native valves.  Slide 5: Final Diagnosis Based on the Durack Criteria (Duke’s Criteria)  with 2 major (positive blood cultures with microorganism consistent with IE and evidence of endocardial involvement on TTE) and three minor criteria (fever >38°C  risk factor- IV drug use  and vascular phenomena) the patient was diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).  Slide 6: Treatment The patient was treated in accordance with AHA guidelines which include an intravenous course of antibiotics like Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for around 6 weeks. The new atrioventricular block necessitated the placement of a permanent pacemaker. The patient's cardiac function was closely monitored.  Slide 7: Patient Outcome Patient's condition improved gradually over a span of 6-8 weeks. He finished his antibiotic course and was enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program to avoid relapse of infection.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case highlights the need for early diagnosis and treatment of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  especially in patients with a history of IV drug usage  as it significantly contributes to the disease's morbidity and mortality.  Slide 9: References All the citations and references used for assembling this presentation are indicated here.    Note: Although Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis can affect various populations  it is more prevalent in male patients  especially those with a history of intravenous drug use  poor dental health  and conditions like rheumatic heart disease and congenital heart abnormalities. This case study intends to represent an appropriate demographic based on existing medical literature.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,97,Slide 1: Introduction  Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  which can include one or more heart valves  the mural endocardium  or a septal defect. It predominantly affects older adults with certain risk factors  including rheumatic heart disease and intravenous drug use.  Slide 2: Case Presentation  Patient's Profile: A 65-year-old African American male   Past Medical History: A consistent history of poor dental health and a recent dental extraction. He also has a past medical history significant for rheumatic heart disease from childhood with resultant mitral valve regurgitation.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented with a 2-week history of a fever of unknown origin  chills  night sweats  and a recent weight loss. He also complained of feeling generally unwell and extremely fatigued.   Slide 4: Physical Examination   Physical exam was notable for a temperature of 100.8°F  a new-onset heart murmur  conjunctival petechiae  and palpable spleen.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Procedures   Blood cultures drawn showed growth of Streptococcus viridans  a common pathogen in IE related to dental processes. The diagnosis of IE was confirmed further by trans-esophageal echocardiography showing vegetations on the mitral valve indicative of IE.  Slide 6: Demographics and IE  Infective endocarditis is most common in males in their late 50s and 60s. African Americans are overrepresented in cases of infective endocarditis  accounting for a significant burden of the disease compared to the white population.  Slide 7: Risk factors and IE   Poor dental health triggers bacteremia  increasing the risk for endocarditis. Furthermore  previous history of rheumatic heart disease with resultant valvular disease is a well-established risk factor for the development of IE.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case emphasizes the importance of strong suspicion for IE in patients with previous valvular disease and poor dental health presenting with prolonged fever and new-onset heart murmur. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,3,98,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 2: Patient's Demographic Data  Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. The prevalence of infective endocarditis is higher among males and the risk increases with age  especially after 60.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  He has a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use in his 20s and 30s  although he's been sober for the past 15 years. He also suffers from chronic rheumatoid arthritis  for which he takes immunosuppressant medications. He does not have any known heart defects or previous heart surgeries.  Slide 4: History of Present Illness  He was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever  muscle ache  fatigue  and shortness of breath for two weeks. These symptoms are consistent with infective endocarditis  an infection caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart lining  a heart valve  or a blood vessel.   Slide 5: Relevant Clinical Findings  On examination  he was febrile with temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius  heart rate 90 beats per minute  and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. Also detected were a new murmur on auscultation  Janeway lesions on palms and soles  and Osler nodes noted on his fingers and toes.  Slide 6: Relevant Investigation and Diagnostic Procedures  Blood cultures were taken  which grew Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram showed vegetations on the native mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Discussion  Our patient's demographic data and past medical history put him at a higher risk for developing infective endocarditis. Moreover  his clinical presentation and diagnostic tests further support this diagnosis. His intravenous drug use in the past  even though he's been sober for years  still places him at a higher risk for infective endocarditis.   Slide 8: Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients that present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and fatigue  particularly if they have a past of intravenous drug use and a new heart murmur. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in reducing mortality rates associated with this condition.

It has been discovered that he is an intravenous drug user  having used heroin for the past five years. There is no history of previous heart disease  but he does have a history of Hep C. He reports experiencing a new onset of murmur  and joint aches and pains. On physical examination  he had a body temperature of 38.8 °C  heart rate of 110 beats/minute  and a regurgitant murmur heard at the mitral area. A few tiny red spots (petechiae) were noticed on the conjunctiva and spots on the palms (Janeway lesions) were also noticed. Examination of the peripheral pulses showed a difference in volume between the two arms. His weight was noted to be 10 lbs less than his last doctor visit six months ago. Cardiac ultrasound showed evidence of vegetations on native mitral valve suggestive of endocarditis. Blood cultures have been drawn. Further work-up underway to confirm diagnosis and decide on treatment plan.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,10,A 67-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of diabetes and kidney disease presents with a 2-week history of fever  dyspnea  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also reports experiencing night sweats and has identified multiple painful red nodules on his fingers and toes. He denies any recreational drug use. Patient has poor dental hygiene with visible dental caries. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. On examination  he is found to be febrile with a heart rate of 110/min and his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. Cardiac examination reveals a new regurgitant murmur at the mitral area. The initial assessment indicates possible native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,11,A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug abuse and chronic homelessness presents with symptoms of fever  weight loss  and fatigue. On auscultation  a new-onset regurgitant murmur is discerned. He also exhibits small hemorrhages on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions) and tender nodules in his fingers (Osler's nodes). The patient's medical history includes Hepatitis C  which is common in intravenous drug users. He has not been adherent to standard medical care and doesn't have any known allergies. There is laboratory evidence of increased inflammation markers including ESR and CRP  along with a positive blood culture indicating bacteria in the bloodstream which suggests native valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,12,A 61-year-old Caucasian male  with a medical history significant for intravenous drug use (IVDU) and hepatitis C  presents with a three-week history of intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. Upon further questioning  he discloses experiencing discomfort in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen and occasional night sweats. He denies any recent dental procedures and has not been hospitalised recently. His physical examination reveals a new-onset regurgitant murmur noted upon cardiac auscultation and palpable purpura on his lower extremities  suggestive of immune complex deposition. These findings combined with the patient's history of IVDU and hepatitis C raise the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,13,A 60-year-old  Caucasian male with a history of IV drug use and Hepatitis C  presents with a one-month history of moderate fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and unexplained 5 kg weight loss. He also complains of a new murmur  noticed by him and confirmed by physical examination. The patient also has petechiae in his conjunctiva and over his legs  and Osler's nodes present on the tips of his fingers. His condition is consistent with symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,14,A 62-year-old male patient with a history of intravenous drug use presents with symptoms of weight loss  night sweats  and generalized weakness lasting over the past month. Past medical history reveals years of chronic hepatitis C infection and untreated dental caries but no other significant infectious or cardiac episodes. He reports decreased appetite  subjective fevers  and a new-onset  mild-to-moderate intensity  constant chest discomfort  which doesn't worsen on effort. On examination  he appears cachectic  has poor dentition  and moderate splenomegaly  with oral temperature registering at 38.5°C (101.3°F). Murmurs are noted on auscultation of the heart  and multiple needle track marks are seen on the forearms. Preliminary blood tests show anemia and elevated ESR. Blood cultures have been drawn and the patient is being evaluated for likely native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,15,A 56-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use presents with a two-week duration of fever  malaise  and weight loss. He reports increasing fatigue  poor appetite  and unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over two weeks. He also complains of a new-onset regurgitant murmur on physical examination  accompanied by petechiae on the conjunctiva and splinter hemorrhages on the nails. Patient has a known history of Hepatitis C  which is common among intravenous drug users. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,16,A 44-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presents with a 1-month history of intermittent fever  night sweats  chills  weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms  and fatigue. He describes experiencing short-lived episodes of chest discomfort but denies any pronounced chest pain. Further  he reports noticing several small  painless red-purple skin spots on his extremities. He does not have a history of rheumatic heart disease  dental procedure  or congenital heart disease. He is not on regular medication  denies smoking  and does not consume alcohol. His family history is non-contributory. Physical examination reveals low-grade fever and a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Examination also reveals petechial rash on his lower extremities and Osler’s nodes on his fingers.   This presentation is consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis  with possible involvement of the tricuspid valve due to the patient's history of intravenous drug use. The absence of joint pain and previously established heart disease alongside the acute onset of symptoms suggest a native valve  rather than a prosthetic valve infection. His generalized symptoms of fatigue  weight loss  fever  and night sweats further contribute to the suspicion of infective endocarditis  while the presence of Osler’s node and petechiae supports this diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,5,17,A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use  uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and moderate alcohol consumption presents to the emergency department with general malaise  weight loss  and fever. He also reports a new murmur  and has experienced episodes of night sweats over the past two weeks. He has no prior surgical history or allergies. On physical examination  there is evidence of splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails  as well as Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes. His temperature is 38.5°C  BP is 100/70 mmHg  and his heart rate is regular but rapid. Relevant laboratory results include elevated WBC  C-reactive protein  and ESR  indicating systemic inflammation. Blood cultures are taken and pending.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,1,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: - Male patient - Age: 65 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired - Living situation: Lives alone - Social habits: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol use - Geographic location: Urban area  Past Medical History:  - History of mitral valve prolapse - Recent dental surgery two months ago - History of periodontal disease - No known drug allergies - Previous hospitalization for pneumonia five years ago - Familial history of heart disease - High blood pressure controlled with medication - Underwent angioplasty three years ago  Presenting Symptoms: - Persistent fever for the past 10 days - Shortness of breath - Night sweats - Fatigue - Weight loss - Small  painful red spots on palms and soles - New onset of heart murmur   Provisional Diagnosis:  Based on the presenting symptoms  past medical history  and demographic characteristics  the most likely diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis.  Justification: Elderly patients with a history of valvular heart disease and recent invasive dental procedures  symptoms of persistent fever  new onset of murmur and signs of systemic embolization are at a higher risk of developing infective endocarditis. This diagnosis aligns with the recommendations in the literature and the demographics described in the epidemiological studies on infective endocarditis  which show a higher prevalence amongst elderly males with a history of heart disease.    Risk Factors: - Presence of mitral valve prolapse - Recent dental surgery - Age  - Male gender - History of invasive heart procedures - High blood pressure  Plan:  This patient needs immediate hospital admission for further diagnostic investigations such as blood cultures and echocardiogram. If confirmed  urgent empirical antibiotic treatment should be started until the causative organism is identified. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation should be arranged for potential valve replacement if required. Additional supportive care measures and modification of risk factors are equally essential in his management.

Hypertension: Diagnosed 7 years ago. Controlled with medication. 3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 5 years ago. Managed with statins. 4. Previous dental procedure: Patient underwent a dental extraction a couple of weeks ago.  5. History of smoking: Patient is an ex-smoker  quit smoking 15 years ago. 6. Alcohol: Minimal alcohol consumption  roughly one glass of red wine a week. 7. Exercise: Engages in light physical activity  walks for about 30 minutes every day. 8. Diet: Mostly follows a balanced diet.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents with fever  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  and general malaise. On physical examination  he appears fatigued and has signs of heart murmurs on auscultation. His blood tests reveal evidence of inflammation and elevated C-reactive protein levels.  This patient's presentation is consistent with infective endocarditis  potentially caused by an infection that could have been introduced during his last dental procedure. His chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension might have made him more vulnerable to this type of infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,4,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male with no known history of intravenous drug use. The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis diagnosed five years ago which has been managed conservatively. His past medical history also includes diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are well controlled with medication. He is a retired construction worker  currently lives alone  and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption.  Chief Complaint: The patient is presented with a three-week history of intermittent fever  malaise  night sweats  and a recent onset of unexplained weight loss. The fever has been moderate to high and is not associated with any chill or rigors. He reports a decrease in appetite and likes to lay down most of the time. Lately  he has also noted a new onset of shortness of breath when doing some light physical activity.  Context: Endocarditis generally affects individuals between the ages of 30-60 years. The patient's age is consistent with the typical demographic of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis. As reported in literature  men have a two-fold increased risk compared to women. The patient's previous medical history of aortic stenosis  diabetes  hypertension  and his moderate alcohol consumption habit are additional risk factors that might have predisposed him to acquiring infective endocarditis. The patient's profession – construction worker – does not have a direct role in the etiology of the disease but contributes to a potential physical stress load.  Past Medical History: This is crucial for identifying potential predisposing cardiac conditions. Our patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis which is a known predisposing cardiac condition for native-valve infective endocarditis. Furthermore  poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is linked with an increased risk of several infections  including endocarditis. Well controlled hypertension does not increase the risk directly  but it is often associated with other cardiovascular risk factors.    Problem Representation: 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of aortic stenosis  diabetes  and hypertension presents with a 3-week history of fever  malaise  night sweats  weight loss  and shortness of breath. Given his previous cardiac condition  these symptoms are suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,5,Problem Representation:  Demographic Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male patient presents himself to the emergency department.  Ethnographic Information: The patient is native English speaking  heterosexual  affiliated to Christian religion. He has a Bachelor's degree and works as a mid-level manager in a corporate firm. He lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife and has two adult children who live separately. He is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of IV drug use during his early years  which has ceased for the last 25 years. He has been diagnosed and treated for hypertension over the past 10 years. He also reports occasional toothaches in the past few months  for which he has not sought any professional treatment. His family history includes a father with a history of early onset coronary artery disease and a mother who died in her seventies due to a stroke. He is currently taking antihypertensive medication and has no known allergies.  Current Presentation:  The patient presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent fever  chills  unexplained weight loss  and malaise over the past two weeks. He also mentions experiencing night sweats  fatigue  and aching muscles and joints. Recently  he has identified noticeable rashes or spots on his palms or soles. The primary concern that led to his visit is a new onset of heart murmur that he correlated with his pulse.  Relevant Findings:  On evaluation  the physician identifies irregularities in heart rhythm and the presence of a heart murmur. Preliminary lab reports indicate elevated ESR and C-reactive protein levels while the chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary infiltration with possible signs of mild congestion. Physical examination also reveals splinter hemorrhages under the fingernails  Osler's nodes (painful nodules on fingers or toes)  and Janeway lesions (small  painless  red or purple spots on the palms or soles).   The clinical and lab findings suggest a probable diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis possibly due to the patient's previous vulnerability with IV drug usage and neglect of consistent dental health. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and perhaps a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be considered for confirmation  along with blood cultures to identify the offending microorganism. A multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiologist  infectious disease expert  and a dentist will likely be involved in determining the best plan for treatment and management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,6,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 61 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Marital Status: Married Place of Residence: Urban area Insurance: Medicare   History:  Chief Complaint:  Mr. John Doe presents with a 2-week history of persistent fever  fatigue and unintended weight loss. He also complains of on and off discomfort in the left side of his chest and shortness of breath. He expressed experiencing night sweats and a decrease in appetite.  Medical History: 1.

Medication: Beside his hypertension medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily)  he does not take any other regular medication. Occasionally  he takes over the counter pain medication for arthritis.  Family History: His mother had Heart Disease and his father had Type 2 Diabetes. His father passed away from complications related to Diabetes at 65 years.  Social History: He lives with his wife. He is a retired teacher. He is a former smoker. He drinks alcohol socially  roughly 4 drinks per week. He has no known drug use.  Review of Systems: Positive for fever and chills  fatigue  unintended weight loss  decreased food consumption  chest discomfort  and shortness of breath. Negative for rash  cough  hemoptysis  nausea and vomiting  abdominal pain  changes in bowel habit.  Physical Examination: Vitals: T 38.5°C  BP 135/80 mmHg  HR 98 bpm  regular. RR 16 bpm  SpO2 98% room air. Cardiovascular: Irregular heart beat with a systolic murmur noted. Respiratory: Normal sounds heard bilaterally. Rest of the exam is within normal limits.  Problem Representation: A 61-year-old male  with significant past medical history including Rheumatic Fever and hypertension  presents with 2 weeks of persistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  chest discomfort  and difficulty in breathing. These symptoms  in combination with heart murmur and a previous history that includes Rheumatic Fever  are strongly suggestive of possible infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic investigations are required for confirmation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,7,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 48-year-old white male. He lives in an urban/town setting and works as a blue-collar worker.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a two-week history of a high-grade fever associated with chills  fatigue  and easy tiredness. He also reports body aches  night sweats  and a loss of appetite leading to weight loss.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU) for 15 years  last episode 3 days ago. He admits to sharing injecting equipment. There is also a background history of moderate Alcohol Use Disorder  Smoking (10 pack-years)  and Hepatitis C (currently in treatment).  Family History: His mother and father both have hypertension and his father had a Myocardial Infarction at the age of 63.  Social History: He lives alone  has been divorced for 5 years  and has two children who live with their mother. He works as a mechanic full time  but has taken a sick leave due to his current illness. He does not exercise regularly and his diet is mainly fast food.  Relevant Findings on Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears chronically ill and underweight. Fever of 101°F  mild tachycardia (110 bpm)  and blood pressure is normal. Cardiac examination reveals a diastolic murmur at the left sternal edge. There is also evidence of needle track marks in antecubital fossa.  Preliminary Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history  physical exam findings and risk factors present  a preliminary diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis secondary to IVDU is suspected.  Further Evaluation: Blood cultures should be done before initiating antibiotics. Transthoracic echocardiogram (or if necessary  a transesophageal echocardiogram) should be performed to identify endocardial involvement. Other diagnostic procedures include a complete blood count  ESR  CRP  and tests for kidney and liver function. Considering the patient's IVDU history and accompanying Hepatitis C diagnosis  liver function tests  Hep C viral load  and monitoring for other bloodborne infections would be necessary. For his cardiac risks  cholesterol and lipid profile would be worthwhile. Review his Hep C management progress and his alcohol and IVDU to address possible rehabilitation or interventions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,8,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 58-year-old male patient  identified as Caucasian based on representative demographics  enters the clinic reporting symptoms relating to fevers  fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past several weeks. He has a history of intravenous drug use  currently ceased but was an active user for over 10 years. He also has a reported history of smoking and excessive alcohol use but has been sober for the last 6 years. Patient's family history includes hypertension in both parents. He also reports a diagnosis of Hepatitis C as a result of prolonged intravenous drug use  for which he received treatment about 3 years ago.   Medical History:  1. Intravenous Drug Use: He was an active user for about 10 years but has been clean for the past 6 years.     2. Hepatitis C: Diagnosed and treated 3 years ago  since then liver function tests have been within normal limits.  3. Smoking: A history of heavy smoking but has quit 6 years ago.  4. Alcohol Abuse: History of alcohol abuse but maintained sobriety for the past 6 years.  5. Hypertension: Genetic predisposition due to both parents suffering from the disease.  Relevant Examination Findings:  1. Clinical signs consistent with congestive heart failure including dyspnea  orthopnea and nocturnal dyspnea.  2. Positive blood cultures indicating an infection.  3. Presence of irregular heart rhythm on cardiac auscultation.  4. Presence of anemia and elevated white blood cell count as shown in laboratory test results.  5.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,9,Patient Profile: - Sex: Male - Age: 70 years old - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Presenting Symptoms: - Prolonged fever with night sweats - Shortness of breath - Fatigue - Recent weight loss - Dark urine  - Persistent cough  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago - History of dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotic treatment - No history of intravenous drug use - No history of valvular heart disease or heart surgery - Diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago - Family history of heart disease  Social History: - Lives alone - Doesn’t smoke  occasional alcohol use  - No history of recreational drug use - Has a pet dog  Narrative Description:  Mr. B  a 70-year-old Caucasian retired teacher presents with prolonged fever  night sweats  shortness of breath  fatigue  recent weight loss  dark urine  and persistent cough. His past medical history reveals a diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago. He has had dental procedures performed without prophylactic antibiotics. Mr. B is a non-smoker but drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a pet dog which he lives with. He has been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago and has a family history of heart disease. His lifestyle includes no history of recreational drug use or intravenous drug use. Mr. B has never had heart surgery or been diagnosed with valvular heart disease.   This type of profile captures a patient demographic and likely medical history observed in typical cases of native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  affecting individuals typically with pre-existing cardiac conditions  high-risk behaviors  or immunocompromised states. Rheumatoid arthritis  diabetes  and a history of non-prophylactic dental procedures are all risk factors predisposing Mr. B to this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Smith is a 45-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use and current smoker. He is unemployed  has low socio-economic status  and is living in poor sanitary conditions.  Presenting Complaint: He has been feeling unwell for about three weeks  experiencing symptoms such as fatigue  malaise  weakness  fever  chills  and excessive sweating  especially during nights. In the last few days  he has noticed some weight loss  loss of appetite  and occasional chest pain.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith's medical history includes several episodes of IV drug-induced septicemia  Hepatitis C  and a recent hospital admission for pneumonia. He has no known allergies. His family history reveals that his father had heart disease and his mother had type 2 diabetes. His alcohol and drug use history confirms ongoing intravenous drug use.   Conclusion: Given the patient's social  behavioral  and medical history  including substance abuse and recent infection  there may be a higher suspicion for infective endocarditis.   Background Literature Research: Infective endocarditis (IE) often affects individuals between the age of 30 and 60 and is more common in males. It shows a higher association with people living in poor conditions  having lower socio-economic status  and those with a history of substance abuse  especially intravenous drug use. A history of valvular heart disease or congenital heart diseases  presents a higher risk of getting IE  but our patient only has a family history of heart disease  so this doesn't necessarily increase the likelihood in this case. Connections have been found between IE and bacterial infections like septicemia and pneumonia  and viral infection such as Hepatitis C  all of which our patient has had in the past.  This profile accurately represents demographics seen in literature and clinical practice. Ongoing monitoring and further investigations would be warranted to confirm diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis and to manage the patient's overall health condition effectively.

Social History: He reports a 2-pack-a-day smoking history for 40 years and admits to drinking alcohol socially. Retired for five years  he lives with his wife and has two adult children.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appears fatigued  has slight pallor  and his temp is 38.2 C. His pulse is irregular  blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg  and respiratory rate is 20 bpm. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  Problem Representation: A 60-year-old heavy smoking and alcohol using Caucasian male with a history of type 2 diabetes  moderate COPD  and a known bicuspid aortic valve presents with symptoms suggestive of potential infective endocarditis  including unexplained weight loss  fatigue  chills  night sweats  and an intermittent fever.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,12,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Patient is a 45-year-old white male with no known drug allergies living in an urban setting in the United States.  Medical History: Patient has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) which ended approximately 10 years prior and a subsequent diagnosis of Hepatitis C  which was treated and has been undetectable for several years. The patient drank regularly until about 8 years ago and has been sober since. He has had no previous surgeries and no known family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient is a smoker  averaging about 1.5 packs per day for the past 20 years.  Presenting Complaint: The patient comes in complaining of 4 weeks of progressive fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  shortness of breath  and a low-grade fever.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the patient is found to have splinter hemorrhages in the nails  Osler's nodes (painful nodules on pad of fingers)  Janeway lesions (painless lesions on palm or sole)  and Roth spots in the retina. A heart murmur is heard upon auscultation.  Relevant Tests: Lab tests reveal a significant rise in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). A blood culture also shows evidence of bacteria common to infective endocarditis such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram is conducted and vegetations are found on the heart valves  consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Risk factors identified for this problem: The patient has several risk factors for developing native-valve infective endocarditis. These include a history of IVDU  active smoking  a previous stint with Hepatitis C  and the fact that the patient is male and middled aged. The presence of an untreated dental infection could be a possible source of bacteria causing bacteremia leading to endocarditis. Other potential sources could include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Therefore a detailed examination and/or testing to rule out these potential sources might be required.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,16,Patient Profile: - Name: John Doe - Age: 53 - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Construction worker  Problem: John presents with several symptoms indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis which include fever  chills  fatigue  aching joints and muscles  night sweats  shortness of breath  palpitations  weight loss  and small spots on his skin and under his fingernails. A new or changed heart murmur is also noted during his physical examination. The intensity and duration of his symptoms have been gradually increasing  leading him to seek medical attention.  Relevant Past Medical History: John had a history of intravenous drug use in his early adulthood. He also has a medical history of untreated dental cavities and has always been in poor oral health. Further  he has a history of rheumatic fever in his teens which predisposes him to bacterial endocarditis. Moreover  he was diagnosed with chronic heart valve disease a few years ago. John also has diabetes which could make his infection even more complex due to potential complications.  Smoking and Alcohol: John is a heavy smoker and regularly consumes alcohol in substantial amounts.  Family History: Positive family history of heart diseases  with his father having died from a heart attack.  Medications: John is on insulin therapy for his diabetes. He also takes aspirin regularly to manage his chronic heart disease.  Allergies: No known allergies.  Review of Systems: John has a history of fatigue  weight loss  and loss of appetite. He also mentions episodes of coughing and decreasing exercise tolerance. On cardiac review  a murmur was noted. He also complained of increasing dyspnea.  Demographic breakdown: According to literature  infective endocarditis is more commonly seen amongst males. It is also seen more among individuals with a history of intravenous drug use and/or poor dental hygiene. The median age at diagnosis is around 50 to 60 years old. It is also associated with certain occupations  such as construction work  that have a heightened risk of injury and thereby providing a portal of entry for bacteria.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,17,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 66-year-old white Caucasian male presents with native-valve infective endocarditis. Studies show that the incidence of infective endocarditis is higher in males and in people over 60 years old  which is consistent with our patient profile.  Presenting symptoms: The patient reports a history of fatigue  low-grade fever  loss of appetite  unintentional weight loss  and night sweats for the past several weeks. He also describes a new heart murmur that wasn't there during the last medical check.   Past medical history: He has a significant past history of intravenous drug use in his youth but has been clean for over twenty years. He also indicates the existence of some dental procedures in the last six months with no antibiotic prophylaxis. His baseline health status includes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past decade. His medications include metformin and a daily aspirin. Stopped smoking ten years ago but has a 30-pack year smoking history.  Epidemiological history:  Since retirement  he has limited his social activities and had no recent travel history or exposure to animals that could potentially carry zoonoses.  Family history:  Non-contributory  no known genetic disorders or immediate family members with similar symptoms.  Relevant laboratory and imaging findings: Moderate anemia and elevated inflammatory markers were noted during initial laboratory investigations. Blood cultures are pending  and an initial transthoracic echocardiogram shows vegetation in the mitral valve suggestive of endocarditis.   Based on preliminary evaluations  further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy. The patient's previous intravenous drug use and recent dental procedures represent potential sources of infection leading to his current presentation. His chronic conditions  including type 2 diabetes and hypertension  may also influence his treatment plan and potential outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,18,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: A 60-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis.  Presenting Complaints: The patient has been experiencing persistent fever for the past two weeks  with intermittent chills and night sweats. He also reports fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and poor appetite.   Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are both being currently managed with oral medication. He is a non-smoker with a history of occasional alcohol consumption. No history of recent dental procedures or use of intravenous drugs but underwent knee replacement surgery 6 months ago.   Examination: On physical examination  the patient has a new heart murmur. He has several small  painless  erythematous lesions on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions).   Investigations: Lab tests reveal leukocytosis and increased inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein  ESR). Blood cultures are currently being processed. An echocardiogram showed vegetations on the aortic valve suggesting infective endocarditis.  Hypothesis: The patient's clinical presentation combined with preliminary investigations suggest a likely diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. The bacterial infection may be the result of a bloodstream infection post knee-replacement surgery.  Management: Antibiotic therapy will be initiated empirically until definitive blood culture results can guide more specific treatment. Cardiology consultation for close monitoring of cardiac function and possible surgical intervention for the infected valve  if it becomes necessary  should be considered. Patient education for infection prevention strategies will also be part of the management plan.  Risk Factors: The patient's history of heart disease and diabetes may have increased his risk of developing infective endocarditis. Age and the recent surgery are also significant risk factors.   Social History: The patient lives with his wife. He is a retired banker and engages in regular physical activity like walking and swimming.   Family History:  The patient's family history includes coronary artery disease in his father and hypertension in his mother. No known family history of valvular heart diseases or infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,19,Patient Profile:   Name: John Doe Age: 61 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint:   Fatigue  fever  weight loss  and night sweats for the past 4 weeks. Also complaints of shortness of breath.  Medical History:  1. Past history of intravenous drug use more than 15 years ago. 2. Prior diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. 3. History of frequent dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotics.  Social History:  1. Smoker  1 pack a day for 30 years. 2. Alcohol use – previously used heavily  now occasional 3. Works as an independent builder and lives with his wife.  Family History:  1. Father died at the age of 80 due to ischemic heart disease. 2. Mother died from breast cancer at the age of 76. 3. One brother  alive  with no significant cardiovascular or other diseases.  Physical Examination:   On examination  presents with pallor  mild peripheral edema  and Petechial rashes noted on the lower limbs. He has a regurgitant murmur best heard in the mitral area on auscultation. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg  pulse rate is 100/min  and respiratory rate is 22/min.  Relevant Investigations:  1. Blood cultures are positive. 2. Echocardiogram shows vegetation in the mitral valve. 3. Full blood count shows raised inflammatory markers  anemia. 4. Chest X-ray shows no signs of congestive heart failure.  Problem representation:  A 61-year-old male smoker with a past of mitral valve prolapse and intravenous drug use presents with a four-week history of fever  night sweats  fatigue  shortness of breath  and weight loss  suggestive of systemic infection or inflammation. Physical examination and investigation findings including the presence of a mitral regurgitant murmur  positive blood cultures  raised inflammatory markers  vegetation in the mitral valve suggest a probable diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. Early intervention is crucial given the worsening symptoms and the potentially fatal nature of the illness. His past history of intravenous drug use places him at risk  and repeated exposure to dental procedures without antibiotic prophylaxis could have been a precipitating factor.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,20,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  54-year-old caucasian male born and living in a suburban area in the United States  employed as a construction worker. He is a smoker and is fond of moderate alcohol consumption.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a high-grade fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit which he has had for the past two weeks. He has been experiencing dyspnea  night sweats and unintentional weight loss. He also complains of anorexia  malaise  and a new onset of a heart murmur.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of bi-leaflet Mitral Valve Prolapse(MVP) diagnosed 5 years ago. He has been regularly under follow-up and was doing well until recently. The patient also has a history of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU) but ceased usage around 2 years ago. His other medical history includes moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to long-term smoking and partially treated Dental Caries. The patient is not diabetic  does not have a history of rheumatic fever or hypertension and isn't undergoing any form of immunosuppressant treatment. He does not have a family history of cardiac diseases.   Completed Investigations: On clinical examination  his vitals were stable except for tachycardia. Janeway lesions were observed on the soles of his feet  and splinter hemorrhages were found under his nails. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed vegetation on the mitral valve leaflets.   Hypothesis: Based on his symptoms  past medical history  and investigations  this patient is likely presenting with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). The fact that he has been experiencing these symptoms for over two weeks and having known MVP along with the evidence from the TTE highly indicative of this condition. His past IVDU could have exposed him to Staphylococcus Aureus  Pseudomonas Aeruginosa  or Candida  which are known causes for NVIE. His untreated dental caries could represent another potential source of bacterial pathogens that can lead to NVIE  possibly due to Streptococcus mutans.   Assessment:  This 54-year-old male patient presents with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with NVIE. His history of untreated dental caries  known MVP  and prior IV Drug Use could have been potential sources of bacteremia leading to NVIE. The TTE results also support the diagnosis.   Plan: To confirm the diagnosis  blood cultures should be obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy. After that  a tailored treatment plan will include a regimen of antibiotics and possible surgery  depending on the patient's response to antibiotics. The plan will also include educating the patient on maintaining good oral hygiene and regular follow-ups regarding his MVP. Possible future interventions could include the mitral valve repair or replacement if the disease progresses.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,21,Patient Profile: 1. Age: 60 years old 2. Gender: Male  3. Race: Caucasian 4. Occupation: Retired teacher 5. Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional drinker  maintains good hygiene  no history of IV drug use.   Health Status: 1. Past Medical History: The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease from childhood that was never adequately treated. He had a mild heart attack five years ago and has been on medication for hypertension for the past decade. He also had a dental procedure performed two weeks ago.  Presenting Symptoms: 1. The patient has been noticing fever  chills  fatigue  aching muscles and joints  night sweats  edema in his feet  legs  and abdomen. He also reports a new heart murmur  rapid weight loss  and loss of appetite.   Reason for Presentation: The patient was brought by his spouse who was particularly concerned about his persistent high fever and new heart murmur.  Possible Problem: Given the presenting symptoms and considering his past medical history  the patient appears to be suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection of the heart's inner lining (endocardium) or the heart valves caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and settling in the heart.  Related Factors: The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and recent dental procedures significantly increases his vulnerability to the infection. Additionally  his age and previous heart conditions also make him more susceptible to this condition.   Appropriate Physical Examination and Investigations: On suspicion of infective endocarditis  the clinician should undertake a comprehensive physical examination with particular attention to findings that may indicate infection such as a new heart murmur. Further diagnostic procedures such as blood cultures  an electrocardiogram (ECG)  and an echocardiogram should be initiated to validate the clinical suspicion.  Treatment: If confirmatory investigations reveal infective endocarditis  appropriate antibacterial therapy should be initiated and the patient may require hospitalization. In severe cases  surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged heart valves.  Patient Education: Patient and his family should be educated about the disease  its treatment  follow-up care  and the importance of maintaining good dental hygiene.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,22,Patient Profile:  Name: Alan G. Age: 50 years old Sex: Male Occupation: Construction worker  Ethnicity/Race: Caucasian Living situation: Lives with spouse in urban metropolis Socioeconomic status: Middle-class   Problem Representation:  Mr. Alan G.  a 50-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints consistent with infective endocarditis. His major clinical manifestations include marked fatigue  night sweats  persistent low-grade fever  and unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. He also reports experiencing intermittent discomfort in his chest and joints  newly noticed small red spots on his palms and soles  and shortness of breath  yet denied of having a cough or hemoptysis. He has observed changes in his nails with pain and swelling in his fingertips.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Alan G. has a history of IV drug usage through his early adulthood  but reports he has abstained for the past 15 years. He also has a known history of dental procedures done without appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. His medical history includes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  hypertension attended with pharmacological therapy. There is no history of any hereditary or chronic illnesses. He also reports he is a current smoker (20 cigarettes/day for the past 30 years). He is not known to have any allergies.   This case presents a typical patient with a clear connection to endocarditis risk factors. Epidemiological studies show that infective endocarditis predominantly affects men (~60-75% of cases). The mean age observed is ~50 years old. Caucasian individuals seem to be at a somewhat higher risk  particularly for native valve infective endocarditis. IV drug users especially have high-risk of native-valve infective endocarditis due to an increased proclivity to Staphylococcus aureus. Dental procedures without appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis also increase the risk of dissemination of microbes into the bloodstream leading to endocarditis. Other predisposing factors for endocarditis include age  male gender  and history of heart valve disease.   Thus  with vague systemic signs such as fatigue  low-grade fever  night sweats paralleled with some typical signs of infective endocarditis such as splinter hemorrhages  shortness of breath and chest discomfort  Mr. Alan G. fit well with the profile of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis. Therefore  more investigations needed for the firm diagnosis and treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,23,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: • Age: 60 years old • Gender: Male • Race/Ethnicity: White • Socioeconomic Status: Middle class • Occupation: Retired electrician  Presenting Complaint: • Persistent fever of a couple weeks duration which has not reduced despite taking over-the-counter medicines • General fatigue  weakness  and malaise • Severe night sweats causing sleep disturbances • Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss • Shortness of breath  especially with exertion • Heart murmur  Relevant Past Medical History: • History of rheumatic fever in childhood • Mitral valve prolapse diagnosed ten years ago • Mild hypertension controlled with medication • Dental procedures performed recently  specifically tooth extraction  with no prophylactic antibiotics. • Former smoker with a 20-pack year history  quit smoking 15 years ago • Regular alcohol consumption • No history of IV drug usage  Relevant Family History: • Father had a history of coronary artery disease and mother had hypertension.  Given the symptoms and background history  the clinical scenario suggests native-valve infective endocarditis  which needs to be evaluated further with appropriate investigations. Commonly  white males of 30 to 60 years of age are affected. Existence of a valve disease (like mitral valve prolapse here) or a prior rheumatic heart disease  invasive procedures without prophylactic antibiotics administration  and being a former smoker with regular alcohol consumption can predispose to infective endocarditis. Fever  fatigue and weight loss  night sweats  shortness of breath  and a new or changed heart murmur can be signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,24,Problem Representation:  Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old white male from a middle-income socioeconomic background who presents to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis. He has a history of occasional social drinking and is a non-smoker. Mr. Smith has a relevant medical history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus and a recent dental procedure about two months ago. He has no other significant past medical or surgical history  and he does not have any known allergies.  The clinical features Mr. Smith is presently showing include a low-grade fever  loss of appetite  general fatigue  and a new onset of heart murmur. He also described experiencing intermittent bouts of night sweats and unexplainable weight loss over the past few weeks. In addition  he has been having difficulty sleeping due to discomfort in the left side of his chest.   Mr. Smith's current medication regimen to manage his diabetes includes Metformin and Glipizide. However  he admits he has not been adherent with his medication regimen lately due to financial constraints.  He denies any recent travel or exposure to communicable diseases. His sexual history is unremarkable and he claims he has maintained a monogamous relationship with his wife of 40 years. He does not use intravenous drugs and has no known history of sexually transmitted diseases.  The patient's family history is notable for heart disease; his father had an episode of myocardial infarction at the age of 50  and his older brother had a stroke at the age of 60.  In his social history  he worked as an accountant until his retirement five years ago. He lives with his wife and their Toy Poodle in a well-maintained suburban home.  Mr Smith's symptoms  past medical history  and recent dental procedure point towards the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis  a diagnosis that would require urgent assessment and potentially lifesaving treatment. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,25,Patient Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  Age: 64 years old  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Living Situation: Lives alone  Social Situation: Retired engineer  smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Family History: Father had a heart attack at age 70; mother had hypertension and diabetes.  GP regular review: last seen 8 weeks ago.   Presenting Complaint:  Patient presents with the complaint of fatigue  sweating  low-grade fever ranging between 99.5°F to 100.5°F  shortness of breath  particularly with activity for the past two weeks  weight loss of about 5 kilograms over the last month. Patient also mentioned occasional chest discomfort and recently noticed dark red spots on their palms and soles.   Past Medical History:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (diagnosed in the early stage about 2 years ago)  hypertension (controlled by medication for the past 10 years).    Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient is found to have pale conjunctiva  a new systolic murmur  small painless red spots on skin (Janeway lesions)  small painful nodes in the pads of the fingers (Osler's nodes)  and nontender small red or purple spots under the fingernails (splinter hemorrhages).   Investigations:  Discovered vegetation on the mitral valve with the help of an echocardiogram. Series of blood cultures found growth of Streptococcus mutans  an organism often found in native-valve infective endocarditis patients.   Clinical Impression:  64-year-old male with a past medical history significant for COPD and hypertension presents with fatigue  low-grade fever  weight loss  a new systolic murmur  and characteristic skin manifestations  consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis. Patient's smoking history  advanced age  and male gender may have contributed to his risk. Confirmatory diagnosis was made through echocardiogram findings and positive blood cultures for Streptococcus mutans.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,26,Patient Profile: Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male from an urban area  with a history of intravenous drug use (IDU) approximately 30 years ago. He is an ex-smoker with a 20 pack-year smoking history and has been alcohol-free for the last 15 years. He is retired and lives alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his past smoking history and is on regular medication for the same. He had undergone aortic valve replacement surgery 10 years ago due to aortic stenosis.  Presenting Complaints: For the past 2 weeks  Mr. Smith has been experiencing intermittent fever with temperatures of up to 101 F  fatigue  and shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. He has also had occasional night sweats and lack of appetite for the same duration.  Family History: His father had ischemic heart disease  his mother had type 2 diabetes  and his elder brother passed away at the age of 70 due to lung cancer.  Social History: Mr. Smith lives alone but interacts with a group of older adults in his community regularly. He does not have any pets. He admits that his diet has not been nutritious due to lack of appetite  but he tries to maintain hydration.  Representation of the Problem: The clinical scenario raises the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis in Mr. Smith  considering his past history of aortic valve replacement and intravenous drug use. Symptoms of fever  fatigue  night sweats  loss of appetite  and shortness of breath on exertion supports this hypothesis. A comprehensive diagnostic work-up would be needed to confirm this.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,27,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 1. Demographics: 60-year-old Caucasian male  2. Social History: Non-smoker  Non-alcoholic 3. Family History: No significant hereditary diseases   Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with a four weeks history of persistent unexplained fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. There has been an inspection of a new heart murmur that was not previously documented.  Past Medical History: 1. Dental procedure one month back: The patient had a dental extraction  a well-known risk factor for infective endocarditis. 2. Congenital heart disease: The patient was born with bicuspid aortic valve  a condition that alters the normal flow of blood and increases the risk of infective endocarditis. 3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was diagnosed with type-II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  which has been controlled with oral medications.  Physical Examination: 1. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new diastolic murmur over the aortic area of the heart. 2. Examination of the extremities revealed Osler nodes (red  painful nodules on the fingers and toes). 3. Ophthalmic examination reinforced suspicions by revealing sight-threatening complications like Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages with white centers).  Investigations: 1. Blood culture: Multiple blood culture tests performed with at least a 12-hour interval between tests. 2. Echocardiogram: Transesophageal and Transthoracic echocardiograms to visualize heart structures. 3. Complete blood count  ESR  and CRP.  This representation is consistent with demographic data from literature  indicating endocarditis predominantly affects males  and is more common in the older adult population. The patient's congenital heart disease and dental procedure are notable risk factors. Diabetes is also an independent risk factor for infective endocarditis due to altered immunological defenses.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,28,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: John  a 53-year-old Caucasian male  has come to the emergency department with complaints of unexplained weight loss  fatigue  night sweats  and intermittent fever over the past few weeks. He has a history of Intravenous drug use (up to 5 years back). He works as a construction worker and is a resident of an urban area. He has been a moderate smoker for over 30 years and a heavy drinker. His BMI is 29 and regularly consumes fast food  but his diet lacks fruits and vegetables. He has a past medical history of a mild heart attack around 2 years ago. He had been on antiplatelet therapy post the event. His family history suggests his father died of a stroke  and his mother is a living diabetic.   Problem Detail:  John is presenting with the following symptoms:  - Unexplained weight loss - Fatigue - Night sweats - Intermittent fever  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Intravenous drug use (up to 5 years back) - Past mild heart attack (2 years ago) treated with antiplatelet therapy - Moderate smoker and heavy drinker - Unhealthy diet  overweight with BMI 29 - Family history of Cardiovascular disease and diabetes  Possible Diagnosis:  Considering his symptoms and medical history  John might have native-valve infective endocarditis. Intravenous drug use history  unhealthy lifestyle  and a history of cardiovascular disease increase his risk substantially. However  comprehensive diagnostic evaluation  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  is essential to confirm the diagnosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,29,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male - Age: 60 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Social History: - Employment: Retired factory laborer  - Habits: Non-smoker  occasionally drinks alcohol  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with persistent fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and weight loss for several weeks. Recently  the patient has experienced shortness of breath and has noted swelling in his ankles.  Past Medical History: - History of having poor oral health  especially recurrent tooth infections and treatment - History of intravenous drug use during his youth  which ceased 30 years ago - History of previous hospitalization for colon surgery two years ago  Physical Examination: - Appearance: Pale and fatigued - Temperature: 38.5°C (101.3°F) - Heart Examination: Irregular heartbeat detected  a murmur heard on auscultation - Examination of extremities showed peripheral oedema  Based on current symptoms and past medical history  coupled with the physical examination findings  a comprehensive and systematic investigation should be launched  including blood cultures and echocardiography  for the possible diagnosis and management of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Recent Research and Demographics for Reference: Literature suggests that infective endocarditis predominantly affects men  with a male to female ratio of approximately 2:1 (Baddour et al.  2005). In the Western world  the age of patients with endocarditis is increasing  with a mean age in the 50s decade of life (Baddour et al.  2005). Intravenous drug use is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis  particularly in native valves. Other risk factors include poor oral health and prior hospitalizations wherein sterile procedures may have been done (Mylonakis & Calderwood  2001). The patient's presentation and past medical history match these demographic characteristics.   References: 1. Baddour  L.M.  Wilson  W.R.  Bayer  A.S.  Fowler  V.G.  Tleyjeh  I.M.  Rybak  M.J.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,30,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic Information:  - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired military officer - Residing Country: United States  Presenting Complaint:  The patient is presenting with a 2-week history of fevers  night sweats  fatigue  a new heart murmur  and unintentional weight loss.   Past Medical History:  - Moderate aortic stenosis diagnosed 5 years ago. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed with Metformin. - Past smoker  quit 10 years ago.  Recent History:  - Oral dental procedures 1 month ago.  Family History:  - Father passed away from a heart attack at age 70. - Mother has hypertension and is still alive.  Social History:  - Lives alone in a suburban neighborhood. - Son visits on weekends. - Used to enjoy golf but has had to stop because of recent lack of energy.  Physical Examination Findings:  - Tachycardia and a new systolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. - Fever of 38.5°C. - Pale conjunctiva and oral petechiae. - Splenomegaly and small painless erythematous lesions on the pads of fingers and toes.  From the data available in the literature  several characteristics of this patient align with typical demographics of native-valve infective endocarditis. His age  gender  and history of aortic stenosis are risk factors for native-valve endocarditis. Further investigations  like blood cultures and echocardiogram  are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover  his diabetes and past smoking habit may increase the risk for complications. His recent dental procedures may have allowed bacteria to enter the bloodstream  leading to endocarditis. The patient's fever  heart murmur  and skin findings could be indicative of endocarditis but can also be found in other conditions. Hence a differential diagnosis is necessary to rule out other possibilities.   References:  - Writing  A. M. (2019). Problem representation.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,31,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  as in the U.S. Caucasians have shown to have the highest rate of infective endocarditis. He is an intravenous drug user  as this group is at an increased risk. He lives in a low socioeconomic area  as epidemiologic studies have suggested that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are at a higher risk. He has a past history of alcohol abuse disorder  adding to his risk probabilities.  Past Medical History: The patient has a complex past medical history. He has a history of diabetes  which is a risk factor for infective endocarditis. He has a history of IV drug abuse  which increases his risk of bloodborne infections  including infective endocarditis. Further  his past surgical history includes a mitral valve repair surgery 10 years ago  which increases his risk for native-valve infective endocarditis.   Considering non-cardiac surgeries  he underwent a gastric bypass procedure 15 years ago for morbid obesity. Given his high BMI and potential complications post-surgery  this could contribute to his predisposition for infections.  The patient is also documented to have chronic kidney disease secondary to longstanding  poorly controlled hypertension. This  along with his diabetes  might have brought about abnormal changes in his immune response  making him more susceptible to infections.   In addition  the patient had an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 5 years ago  which was adequately treated at that time but could predispose him for a future infective endocarditis. He is not currently on any antibiotic prophylaxis.  Social History: The patient is a current smoker of 45 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. He is separated and lives alone  making it difficult to aim for a robust social support system in the disease management strategy. The patient's social history contributes to his overall risk profile and provides context for his health behaviors.   Representation of Current Problem: The patient is presenting with a 1-week history of fever  chills  night sweats  decreased appetite  and discomfort in his left flank. On examination  he has a new systolic murmur and petechiae on the palmar surfaces of his hands and conjunctiva. His blood cultures are positive for Streptococcus viridans  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Considering his deteriorating renal function and systemic signs of infection  he is at high risk for complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,32,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  1. Sex: Male 2. Age: 60 years old 3. Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian 4. Occupation: Retired construction worker 5. Lifestyle: Former smoker  alcohol occasionally  history of intravenous drug use in his younger years   Presenting symptoms:  1. Persistent high-grade fever with chills  2. Fatigue and weakness 3. Night sweats  4. Unexplained weight loss  5. New heart murmur  6. Skin manifestations such as Osler’s nodes  Janeway lesions 7. Evidence of embolic events  such as stroke or acute kidney injury  Past Medical History:  1. History of Rheumatic heart disease  2. History of mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation 3. History of previous infective endocarditis  4. History of diabetes mellitus type 2  on oral hypoglycemic agents 5. History of intravenous drug use  Endocarditis has been prevalent among Caucasian males in their early sixties  especially among those with past medical history of intravenous drug use  diabetes  or valvular heart disease including previous episodes of endocarditis. The incidence tends to increase in patients with a history of structural heart diseases  such as Rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse.  Clinical  imaging  and laboratory findings  as well as the patient's response to treatment  will further contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the patient’s health status. The demographic data and past medical history are consistent with typical patient profiles for native-valve infective endocarditis  aligning with published literature on the topic.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,33,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male from an urban setting  presenting with symptoms of fever  malaise  and weight loss. He is a smoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle  working as a financial adviser. He also has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  Past Medical History The patient has a significant past medical history of intravenous drug use in his early twenties  which has since resulted in a previous episode of infective endocarditis approximately 20 years ago. Since then  the patient has undergone treatment for drug addiction and has remained sober for 15 years. The patient also has a history of rheumatic fever in childhood  mild obesity  and type 2 diabetes managed with medication.  Family History The patient's father passed away at 70 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother  age 85  is living with controlled hypertension. There is no history of endocarditis or any other heart diseases in the family.  Presenting Complaint The patient has been experiencing moderate to severe intermittent fever for the past 10 days  accompanied by chills  night sweats  and loss of appetite. He has also lost around 10 pounds over the past three months without any dietary changes or increased physical activity. He complains of mild shortness of breath  fatigue  and lethargy. There is no cough  chest pain  or edema.   Examination On examination  he is pale with a temperature of 38.5°C  pulse 100 per minute  blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  and respiratory rate 18 per minute. Cardiac examination reveals a new murmur.  Objective The goal of this case is the diagnosis and management of a potential case of native-valve infective endocarditis  as suggested by the combination of a history of intravenous drug use  symptoms such as fever and weight loss  and the presence of a new cardiac murmur on examination.    Possible Complications Consideration should also be given to potential complications  such as heart failure and embolic events  which could impact management and prognosis.   Other considerations The patient's past medical history (including previous infective endocarditis  drug use  and current lifestyle) and demographic factors (including age and race) have been considered in constructing this problem representation.                                                                                                 References This patient presentation is in line with data from the literature which suggests that infective endocarditis is more common in males  tends to occur in middle to older age  and is frequently associated with a history of intravenous drug use and/or pre-existing heart disease such as rheumatic heart disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,34,Patient Presentation  Demographics:  John Doe  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  is a resident of an urban area. He is unemployed and has a history of homelessness. He does not smoke or drink alcohol  but has a history of intravenous drug use.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history which includes repetitive intravenous drug abuse over the last 15 years. There is a documented history of Hepatitis C infection from his past intravenous drug use. He has no known allergies. He previously experienced an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 3 years ago but completed the prescribed course of antibiotics.  Present Illness:  Over the past week  he has noticed progressive fatigue  malaise  and intermittent fever with night sweats. He also describes an appetite loss with unintentional weight loss. On examination  he appears fatigued and exhibits some finger clubbing. There is a systolic murmur best heard at the apex  which was not documented in previous medical records. Other significant findings include petechiae noted on his sclera  conjunctiva  and distal extremities. Further investigation also identified Osler’s nodes in his fingers and toes  and Janeway lesions in palms and soles.   Problem Representation: Given the background of a 55-year-old man  who is a long-term intravenous drug user  presenting with symptoms of low-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  a new systolic murmur  and classic skin and mucosal lesions  there is a high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis related to his drug abuse history and native valve status.   Literature references indicate that infective endocarditis is more commonly found in males [PubMed:26857892]. As per a study published in JAMA  the prevalence of infective endocarditis is increasing among those with drug use disorders  particularly in urban areas [PubMed:28350929]. Disease predisposition in the homeless or unemployed population is frequently associated with limited access to health care  added to substance abuse making them more prone to infectious diseases [PubMed: 28379749]. As such  these factors cumulatively portray a picture of high risk for developing infective endocarditis in this patient.   Concerning presentation  symptoms of low-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  a new systolic murmur  and classic skin and mucosal lesions; they are considered characteristic for infective endocarditis  and align with literature references [PubMed:28118680  PubMed:26868136  and PubMed:27777222]. Further evaluation and management protocols should  therefore  be expedited to confirm diagnosis and commence appropriate treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,35,Patient Characterization:  Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with fever  fatigue  night sweats  and weight loss. He has a history of intravenous drug use  which is a common risk factor for infective endocarditis. Furthermore  he also has a history of cardiac conditions including a previous myocardial infarction and heart failure. He is unemployed and lives in an urban setting in lower socioeconomic conditions. He is not currently on any regular medications nor does he have any known allergies. His family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases  with both parents having succumbed to heart-related complications.  Risk Factors:  1. Intravenous drug use (IVDU): Former history of intravenous drug use poses a significant risk since this route of drug delivery can introduce bacteria or fungi into the bloodstream  adhering to the cardiac valves and leading to infective endocarditis.  2. Age: Advanced age can result in a higher predisposition to infective endocarditis.  3. Gender: Infective endocarditis tends to be more prevalent among males.  4. Cardiac history: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and heart failure increases the risk of infective endocarditis. In particular  prior damage to the heart valves predisposes them to bacterial adherence and subsequent infection.  5. Socioeconomic factors: Lower socioeconomic background and unemployment foster living conditions conducive to health risk behaviors  disease and poor access to healthcare  increasing the chances of acquiring and poorly managing infections  including endocarditis.   Signs and Symptoms:  Presenting symptoms are consistent with infections endocarditis  including intermittent fever  fatigue  night sweats  and weight loss. Other signs to look out for would be Osler nodes (painful red nodules on the fingers) and Janeway lesions (painless red lesions on the palms or soles).   Medical History:   Previous cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and heart failure result in heart tissue damage  creating niches for bacterial or fungal colonization. His history of IVDU is indicative of lifestyle factors that could heighten the risk of exposure to infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,36,Patient Profile:   Mr. Thomas is a 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use. He lives in an urban area on the East Coast of the United States and is retired from his former job as construction worker. Thomas is currently unemployed and without health insurance. He is separated from his wife and lives alone. He has two adult children whom he sees occasionally. He is a current smoker and has a history of alcohol abuse  although he has abstained from alcohol for the past 3 years.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Thomas has a notable previous medical history that consists of intravenous drug abuse  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  and Hepatitis C infections. His COPD is mostly managed with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. His Hepatitis C infection was diagnosed five years ago and he completed antiviral treatment regimens successfully  but hasn't undergone further evaluation for hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. He's not under any current medication regime for his history of drug abuse. He is not known to have any allergies.  Present History:   Mr. Thomas has been feeling fatigued and short of breath for the last two weeks  accompanied by low-grade fever and night sweats. He reports a loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss of about 7 kilos over the last two months.   On examination  he is found to have a new murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. His pulse rate is irregular  and he exhibits localized weakness on the left side of his body hinting at possible embolic events. His temperature is 38.4 degrees Celsius.   By correlating his symptoms  history of IV drug use  and physical exam findings  Mr. Thomas likely has native valve endocarditis. Based on his specific risk factors  likely pathogens could be Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and less likely  Streptococcus viridans.   Blood cultures and echocardiogram would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative pathogen for appropriate targeted antibiotic treatment. Multidisciplinary team input would also be necessary for the management of his drug abuse and his neurological symptoms. Further investigation for potential systemic complications  such as metastatic infections and glomerulonephritis  is also necessary  considering the duration and systemic manifestations of his illness. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,37,Patient Description: Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint:  Progressing fatigue and persistent fever for the last few weeks and unexplained weight loss.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,38,Patient Profile:  Mr. John Doe  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  a resident of a high-income country with access to quality healthcare  comes in presenting symptoms akin to native-valve infective endocarditis. Given the statistical majority presented in literature  he is not a low-risk individual  but rather one who already suffers from some form of heart condition.   Past Medical History:  - At the age of 40  Mr. Doe was found to have hypertensive cardiovascular disease  requiring long-term antihypertensive therapy. His blood pressure has remained controlled within normal limits since then. His BMI is 28 which is considered overweight.   - He has a history of rheumatic heart disease diagnosed during childhood  which went untreated : a confirmed prognosis leading to an increased risk for developing endocarditis.  - He has been diagnosed with periodontal disease five years ago  which puts him in increased risk due to potential bacteremia from frequent dental procedures.  - Mr. Doe also has a dental prosthesis inserted around six months ago.  - He underwent a mitral valve replacement surgery six years ago  following a diagnosis of severe mitral valve prolapse.  Present Symptoms:  Over the past 2 weeks  he has been experiencing persistent low-grade fevers  malaise  night sweats and mild weight loss. Subsequently  he developed worsening shortness of breath  cough and easy fatigue.   Lifestyle:  Mr. Doe is a former smoker with a 20-year pack history but quit fifteen years ago. He is a moderate alcoholic  consuming two glasses of red wine daily. He maintains a diet high in processed food and red meat. His exercise habits are minimal; he only enjoys occasional walks around his neighborhood.   Family History:  - His father had a heart attack at age 62. - His mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Occupation:   Mr. Joe is a retired factory worker  during which he had been exposed to chemicals  dust  and loud noise. Currently  he is living with his wife and enjoys gardening.   Current Medications:  - Daily aspirin (low-dose) - An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension - A beta-blocker for heart disease management  No known drug allergies.  The problem representation is hence: A 57-year-old male with a history of hypertensive heart disease  mitral valve surgery  dental prosthesis  and periodontal disease presents with a two-week history of persistent low-grade fevers  malaise  night sweats  mild weight loss  shortness of breath  and easy fatigue; raising the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,39,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 54 years old  Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Unskilled worker Residential Status: Urban resident Socioeconomic Status: Low  Presenting Issue: John Doe presents with potential symptoms indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis  including fevers  shortness of breath  fatigue  aching muscles  night sweats  chills  unexplained weight loss  and small spots of blood under the nails.  Past Medical History: John has a history of intravenous drug use  last documented 5 years ago. He has previously been diagnosed with a mild form of heart disease and has irregular dental check-ups.  Epidemiological Background: The patient is representative of the typical demographic most affected by native-valve infective endocarditis  being a middle-aged Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use. Research shows that this condition is most common in this demographic group  with males twice as likely to develop the condition than females  and the age group 40-80 being most affected. Substance abuse  particularly intravenous drug use  is also a well-documented risk factor. Other contributing factors include heart disease and poor dental hygiene due to increased risk of bacteria entering the bloodstream.  Symptoms: The typical symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis that the patient is presenting with include fevers  fatigue  aching muscles  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  and signs of minor hemorrhaging. The condition is characterized by bacterial infection of the heart's inner lining or valves  resulting in general sickness and potentially serious heart complications if left untreated.  Risk Factors: Given his past medical history  this patient's risk is increased due to pre-existing heart disease  a history of intravenous drug use  and poor dental hygiene. Non-modifiable risk factors include his demographic profile (middle-aged Caucasian male)  socioeconomic status  and residence in an urban setting.  Problem Representation: The patient's symptoms along with his past medical history and demographic factors strongly suggest a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Early detection and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient prognosis. Considering the patient's past behavior and socio-economic status  a comprehensive and multidimensional approach would be necessary for efficient management of his condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,40,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 60  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Demographics: John is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who is retired and lives alone in a suburban neighborhood. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago. He admits to moderately consuming alcohol on social scenarios. John is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 and has been trying to lose weight through diet and exercise. He has no known allergies.  Relevant Past Medical History: John has a significant past medical history of Rheumatic Fever during his childhood at age 12  he has been known to have structural heart disease and was told he has a mitral valve regurgitation issue in his late 40s. Additionally  he suffered a minor stroke 5 years ago  but regained full function after several months of physiotherapy. Recently  John was diagnosed with insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus type 2  which remains poorly controlled despite medication and dietary changes. He also has Stage 2 Hypertension under pharmacological control with an ACE inhibitor.  Presenting Complaint: John presents with a 3-week history of fever  weight loss  and night sweats  which has been worsening over time. He has a recent decrease in appetite and feels tired all the time. The fever is not associated with any cough  urinary symptoms  diarrhea  or recent trips outside the country. He denies any chest discomfort  palpitations  shortness of breath  or cough.   Based on the demographic data gathered  the population most commonly infected with infective endocarditis consists of middle-aged and older adults  and the disease is also more prevalent in men than women. Additionally  factors such as a former history of structural heart diseases  Rheumatic fever  and poor control of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis.

He had a dental extraction two weeks before the onset of symptoms.   He has a history of occasional smoking but he quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially  mainly on holidays and celebrations.  He exercises regularly  following a moderate-intensity exercise program including 30-minute daily walks and light weight training thrice a week.  Present Symptoms:  Mr. Smith has been feeling fatigued and feverish for the past week. He has also experienced night sweats and weight loss over the past month.   Vitals and Exam:  On his last visit  he was tachycardic and febril with a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. A heart mumur was noted on cardiac examination  and a few scattered petechiae were discovered on his conjunctiva and extremities.   - End of Patient Profile -   Studies suggest that males  especially those over 60 years of age  are more susceptible to developing infective endocarditis. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are common comorbidities. Moreover  invasive dental procedures are known to occasionally lead to bacteremia  posing a risk for infective endocarditis. While smoking is also a known risk factor  cessation reduces this risk over time. The symptoms described  like fever  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats; along with physical signs like heart murmur and petechiae  are common presentations of infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,44,Patient Profile:   Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents with complaints of persistent high-grade fever of around 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit  excessive fatigue  night sweats  muscle aches  and unexplained weight loss over the past three weeks.   Past Medical History:  1) Diabetes Mellitus Type II– Diagnosed 10 years ago  managed with Metformin 1000mg Twice Daily 2) Hypertension - Diagnosed 12 years ago  managed with Lisinopril 20mg once daily 3) History of Smoking - 1 Pack per day for 35 years  quit 5 years ago. 4) Valvular Heart Disease: Diagnosed with aortic stenosis 13 years ago 5) Dentistry: Underwent dental cleaning 4 weeks ago  Social History:  Lives with his wife in the city; retired from job as a school teacher. He is a non-drinker.  Exposures:  Recent dental procedure (Cleaning) - May have caused transient bacteremia.   Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 71  his mother died at the age of 75 due to a stroke. His older sister is alive and has a history of ovarian cancer; she is in remission.  Risk Factors:  1) Age - Increased age is a risk factor for native valve infective endocarditis. 2) Gender - The condition is more common in males. 3) Valvular Heart Disease  4) Dental procedure - Linked with transient bacteremia  a risk factor for infective endocarditis. 5) Diabetes Mellitus - Poor control of diabetes may affect the immune system  increasing the risk of infection. 6) Hypertension - Chronic high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels making them more susceptible to infection.  Clinical Presentation:  The symptoms he is showing like fever  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and muscle aches  are consistent with infective endocarditis.   Considering the above history  the representation of the problem can be constructed. The persistent high fever with generalized discomfort in a patient with a history of valvular heart disease  recent dental cleaning procedure and presence of other comorbidities like Hypertension and Diabetes may represent a probable case of native-valve infective endocarditis. Diagnostic aspects should focus on blood cultures and echocardiographic studies according to published guidelines. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,45,Patient Representation:  Demographics: - 65-year-old Caucasian male  since studies report that older adults living in developed countries are susceptible to native-valve infective endocarditis  and the mortality rate is higher among men. - Lives alone  which might have caused lifestyle factors leading to immunodeficiency  - Personal background: Retired machinist - Education: Completed high school  some college education  Problem: Presenting symptoms include persistent fever  weakness  joint pain  new heart murmur  and unexplained weight loss over the past several weeks. The fever is associated with night sweats and has not been responsive to over-the-counter fever reducer drugs. Has recently developed petechial skin rashes.  Past Medical History: - Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease: Patient has a history of already damaged heart valves due to chronic rheumatic fever  predisposing them to the development of endocarditis.  - Intravenous Drug Use: Long history of heroin use  stopped five years ago  with no relapses. This had placed the patient at high risk for endocarditis in the past. - Dental Procedure History: Underwent tooth extraction two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. Poor oral health and recent invasive dental procedures are known to increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis. - No history of heart surgery  Family History: - Father died of a stroke; mother died of breast cancer. - No known family history of heart disease or endocarditis.  Social History: - Reportedly quit smoking ten years ago and has remained tobacco-free. - Consumes alcohol occasionally  no substance abuse. - Follows a generally healthy diet  consumes a moderate amount of red meat.  Medications: - Takes aspirin daily for previous diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease. - No known allergies to any medications.  Recreational History: - Enjoys gardening  which potentially exposes him to certain bacteria and fungi that can cause endocarditis in individuals who possess other risk factors.  This patient's profile indicates the possibility of a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  and the clinician can proceed with further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography. If confirmed  treatment should start immediately due to the high mortality rate associated with this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,46,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU).  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a two-week history of fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and a new heart murmur.  Demographics: Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is more common in males  with a median age for presentation around 57.8 years according to literature. Caucasians are more likely to develop native-valve IE  compared to other races. Past history of IVDU has been associated with an increased risk of native valve infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which they take Lisinopril. The patient also has chronic Hepatitis C  a common finding in people with a history of IVDU. A history of such illicit drug use significantly increases the chance of IE.  Social History: The patient admits to ongoing IVDU  focused on opioids. He lives alone and does not have any regular employment. He is not on any regular medications apart from his anti-hypertensives.  Occupational History: The patient is unemployed at the moment but used to work as a construction worker.  Family History: There is a family history of heart disease (father had a heart attack at age 59).  Summary Problem List: 1. Presenting complaints: New onset heart murmur  fatigue  night sweats and weight loss. 2. Past medical history: Hypertension  chronic Hepatitis C. 3. Social Risk factors: IVDU (specifically opioids)  living alone  unemployment. 4. Family history: Heart disease.  Relevance: All these factors contribute to the patient's increased risk of developing native valve infective endocarditis. Therefore  immediate and appropriate management should target both the suspected infective endocarditis and the associated complications  as well as the underlying risk factors (IVDU  Hypertension  Hepatitis C). Providing a multidisciplinary team that includes addiction specialists might be beneficial for this patient management.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,49,Patient Profile:  Demographics: Mr. X is a 65-year-old African American male who resides in an urban area within the Northeast region of the United States. He is a retired construction worker  has a relevant family medical history of heart disease and is currently on Medicare. Mr. X is a former smoker  quit smoking 15 years ago  but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He is not homeless  not an IDU (Intravenous Drug User) and doesn't have a history of incarceration.   Past Medical History: Mr. X has a significant past medical history which includes moderate to severe aortic stenosis  compensated congestive heart failure managed by his cardiologist. Additionally  he had been diagnosed and effectively treated for systemic hypertension and type II diabetes mellitis for which he takes medication regularly. He underwent surgical removal of gallstone (cholecystectomy) 5 years ago without any complications. Regular follow-ups have identified no recurrence or other complications since then.   Presenting Problem: Mr. X presents with a two-week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite and an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10lb over the last two months. He also reports four days of increasing dyspnea on exertion and mild cough  but denies chest pain  nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain  change in bowel habits  or urinary symptoms.  Relevant Social History: Mr. X is widowed and lives alone  but close to his daughter who visits him regularly and ensures that he is taking his medications properly. He has a decent support system with neighbors and community members. He denies any recent travel history.  Based on his demographic characteristics and past medical history  and given his new onset of symptoms (especially unexplained fever)  infective endocarditis should be a serious consideration. This is evidenced by his pre-existing cardiac issues (specifically his aortic stenosis and heart failure) which may predispose him to developing this condition. It's important to take prompt and effective clinical measures including blood cultures  echocardiography  and a comprehensive assessment of his overall clinical condition. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial in improving patient outcomes in suspected infective endocarditis cases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,50,Problem Representation  Demographic Characteristics:   - Age: Based on the literature  it is evident that native valve endocarditis predominantly affects older people. Therefore for this representation  the patient would be a 65-year-old individual. - Gender: The disease is found more commonly in males than in females. Therefore  the patient represented here would be a male.  - Ethnicity: There is no stated correlation to a certain ethnicity  so the patient can be of any racial or ethnic background. The chosen representation is of a Caucasian male.  - Lifestyle: The patient is a former tobacco smoker and heavy alcohol consumer. Presently  he is not actively engaged in substance use.   Relevant Past Medical History:  - Cardiovascular health: The patient has a long-standing history of aortic valve sclerosis but has not undergone any form of cardiac valve surgery before. This condition puts him at a higher risk for native valve endocarditis.  - Other underlying diseases: The patient is also known to have Type 2 diabetes  which can serve as a risk factor for various infections  including infective endocarditis. - Dental history: The patient has poor oral health with frequent periodontal infections  adding to the risk factors. - Drug Use: The patient does not have any history of intravenous drug use.  In the light of the possibility of native valve endocarditis  a comprehensive clinical assessment  including physical examination  blood cultures  and echocardiography  will need to be undertaken. The patient's management could possibly require hospitalization and a course of antibiotics  with consideration for cardiac surgery  depending on the severity of the endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,51,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 63 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Location: Suburban  Midwest United States  Past Medical History: 1. Degenerative heart disease  specifically aortic valve sclerosis  diagnosed 4 years ago. 2. History of intravenous drug use until the age of 35  has been clean for the past 28 years. 3. History of smoking (1 pack per day for 30 years)  quit 10 years ago. 4. Treated for a dental abscess 1 month ago. 5. Hypertension controlled with medication. 6. Type II Diabetes Mellitus  controlled by metformin.  Presenting Complaint: John Doe has been experiencing persistent fever of 101-102 F over the past 2 weeks. In addition  he has been suffering from fatigue  shortness of breath  and unintended weight loss. After noticing blood in his urine  he made an appointment with his primary care doctor.   Literature references show that the median age of onset for native valve infective endocarditis is 60 years and is more common in males  especially those with a history of intravenous drug use. Furthermore  invasive dental procedures can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream that can attach to already weakened or damaged heart valves  leading to infective endocarditis. This risk increases significantly in the presence of valve disease  which our patient has in the form of aortic valve sclerosis. Other known risk factors include diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression  both of which our patient has. Thus  his profile seems characteristic for the development of infective endocarditis.   Problem Representation: 63-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use  degenerative heart disease  smoking  hypertension  and diabetes presents with a two-week history of fever  fatigue  dyspnea  weight loss  and hematuria  suggestive of possible infective endocarditis. He also has a recent history of an invasive dental procedure  possibly leading to bacteremia. He faces increased risk due to his age  gender  lifestyle history  and potential bacteremia following his recent dental treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,52,Patient Representation :  1. Chief Complaint : The patient presents with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  occasional chills  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. The patient also reports shortness of breath on exertion and occasional nocturnal cough.  2. Demographics : A 60-year-old male  non-smoker  employed as a software professional.  3. Past medical history : Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has hypertension and was diagnosed with moderate native-valve (mitral valve) stenosis two years ago. He underwent dental procedures six months ago. No history of any apparent trauma or surgeries. There's no history of intravenous drug abuse.  4. Family History : There's a family history of cardiovascular diseases. The patient's father expired due to myocardial infarction at the age of 65 years.  5. Allergic History : No known allergies  6. Medication history : Patient is currently on Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Amlodipine 5mg once daily for hypertension  and Aspirin 81mg once daily for cardiovascular risk reduction.  7. Review of systems : - General: Recent unexplained weight loss - Cardiovascular: occasional palpitations  exertional dyspnea - Respiratory: nocturnal cough - Gastrointestinal/Urinary: no complaints - Neurological: no complaints - Musculoskeletal: no complaints  8. Physical examination : - Moderate distress due to fever - Chest: regular rhythm  early diastolic murmur noted - Rest of the examination is unremarkable   9. Laboratory findings : Blood cultures might reveal bacterial growth (typical organisms include Streptococci  Staphylococci or Enterococci).  10. Summary : A 60-years old male patient  with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and moderate native-valve stenosis presenting with persistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  occasional nocturnal cough and exertional dyspnea.   Keeping the demographic profile  symptoms  medical history and physical findings in mind  these may suggest a complication of native-valve endocarditis possibly due to the dental procedures performed around six months ago. Prompt diagnostic interventions should be done to confirm the condition and initiate appropriate treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,53,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  born and raised in the United States.  Presenting Complaint: He has presented with a month-long history of intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and a new heart murmur.  Social & Environmental History: Mr. Smith is a retired engineer and lives alone following the recent passing of his wife. He is a current smoker with a 40-pack/year history. He used to drink in moderation but quit alcohol 10 years ago. He has no history of intravenous drug use. He has two children with whom he has regular contact. He has regular weekly meetings with his friends at a local seniors' recreation center. He has no significant travel or exposure history.  Past Medical History: Significant medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and suffered a mild stroke 5 years ago. He compliantly follows his prescribed medications: low-dose aspirin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin.  Examination Findings: On examination  Mr. Smith has a new-onset heart murmur best heard in the mitral area  petechiae over his lower limbs  and minor splinter hemorrhages in his nails. Blood pressure records at 145/95 mmHg  heart rate at 80 bpm normal rhythm  respiratory rate 18/min  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. He appears lethargic but fully oriented to person  place  and time.  These clinical presentations along with the new onset heart murmur and positive blood cultures point toward the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis in this patient.  Studies to Confirm Diagnosis: To confirm the diagnosis  Mr. Smith will have to undergo an echocardiogram to visualize vegetations consistent with infective endocarditis along with continued collection of blood cultures to identify the causative pathogen. Additional tests to evaluate the degree and impact of his condition like full blood count  renal function tests  and an ECG will also need to be considered.  Risk factors: Advanced age  male sex  cardiovascular problems (hypertension  heart murmurs)  and unfavorable lifestyle habits (smoking) are the clinical risk factors that have likely contributed to the development of infective endocarditis in Mr. Smith. With his prior history of stroke  it also places him at risk of embolic complications if he does have infective endocarditis. His social activities also might have exposed him to microbial agents causing infective endocarditis.

Past Medical History: He has a past medical history that includes diabetes mellitus (type 2) for the past 15 years  chronic hypertension for the last ten years  and a history of gout. He also had rheumatic fever also when he was a child and has been a smoker for the past 50 years.  Medications: Mr. Smith takes Metformin and Lisinopril in their proper doses. Additionally  he takes Allopurinol for his gout  as well as Aspirin for prophylaxis against cardiovascular disease.  Family Medical History: There is a noted history of heart disease on his father's side who died of a heart attack at the age of 68. His mother and older sibling have diabetes.  Lifestyle: He is a retired engineer and lives with his wife. He smokes about one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years and consumes alcohol occasionally. He mostly stays at home due to his retirement and rarely does any exercises.  As per the literature  Caucasians  especially males  aged around 70 years are the most commonly affected by infective endocarditis  so the said problem representation is reflective of the demographics within the literature. The risk factors identified also correspond to the typical etiological factors leading to the disease like age over 60 years  male sex  existence of preexisting valvular heart disease  diabetes  and tobacco use which indeed increase the prevalence of endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,55,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is Mr. John  a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He is unemployed and living alone in a suburban area. He has a history of limited physical activity and a diet rich in processed foods.  Presenting Symptoms: He is complaining of persistent low-grade fever of 38.0 - 39.0 degree Celsius for the past two weeks. Accompanying symptoms include fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and increasing shortness of breath on exertion. He also complained about a new heart murmur he noticed himself.   Demographic Profile: He is part of the age group 51-70  which constitutes 46% of the population diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis according to literature. Being a Caucasian male  he is also part of the group with one of the highest incidences of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Medical History: His past medical history reveals he was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago but did not opt for valve replacement. He has also been managing his type II diabetes for the past 15 years with oral medication. He has had a history of periodontal disease and underwent dental extraction once  1 year ago.  Social History: He has been a smoker for the past 20 years but quit smoking 2 years ago. He has a history of occasional drinking and denies any drug abuse. He lives alone and follows a sedentary lifestyle without regular exercise.  Recent Interventions or Surgeries: He visited a dentist a month ago for tooth cleaning  but did not take any prophylactic antibiotics before the procedure.   Personal History: There is no known family history of heart disease or rheumatic fever. He maintains poor oral health and has admitted to missing regular dental check-ups.  Problem Summary: Based on the above information and considering the patient's demographic representation  relevant past medical and social history  the suspected diagnosis could be native-valve infective endocarditis  a common disease in males over 60 with previous valvular disease  diabetes  and poor dental health. Additionally  the lack of antibiotics prior to dental procedures increases the risk of bacteremia leading to infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,56,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital with the complaints of persistent fever  chills  malaise  decreased appetite  and unintended weight loss.  Presenting Conditions: On questioning  he mentions that his fever started approximately 5 weeks ago and has continued  undulating in nature  but becoming progressively worse. Alongside fever  he has been experiencing night sweats  unexplained loss of appetite  weight loss of about 15 pounds over the month  fatigue and occasionally  mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The history reveals that our patient has previously been diagnosed with diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and hypertension  for which he is on medication. He has no history of any intravenous drug use or any genetically predisposed disease. The patient also has a previous history of dental procedures.  Family History:  He does not have any significant familial medical history – his parents had hypertension  a sister who is a breast cancer survivor. There is no history of cardiac diseases or autoimmune diseases in the patient's family.  Social History: He is a retired professor  married with two children. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. The patient has no travel history over the past year  does not own any pets  and lives in suburban housing.  Medication History: The patient is on Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin as prescribed by his general physician. He is allergic to Penicillin and shellfish.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  there is the presence of petechiae on his lower legs and feet. Upon auscultation  a murmur is heard at the base of the heart – heightening suspicion for valve involvement.  Laboratory findings: Pending - Would recommend Blood cultures  Complete Blood Count  Echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  This is a problem representation of a person afflicted with native-valve infective endocarditis  where the disease typically affects older males aged 60+  particularly with a history of conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. Caucasian males are more commonly affected and this falls into the demographic characterization found within literature.   Note: The above details are a representation and not real patient data. It might be slightly different from real clinical cases depending on the regional and individual patient variations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,57,Patient Profile: - Age: 60 years - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Health Background: - Past Medical History: Type II diabetes mellitus well-controlled with Metformin  Hypertensive under control with Losartan. - Allergies: No known medication allergies.  - Family History: Mother had Lupus  Father had Colon Cancer. - Social History: Non-drinker  non-smoker. Lives alone. Active  enjoys gardening and volunteering at the local library.   Presenting Problem: The patient is presenting with a three-week history of evolutionary symptoms including weakness  intermittent fever  night sweats  diminished appetite and weight loss. He also mentions experiencing discomfort in his joints and muscles. More recently  he noticed some spots on his legs that he identified as petechiae.   Relevant Findings: - Physical exam: The patient is afebrile  heart rate is somewhat rapid  blood pressure slightly low; a heart murmur is present upon examination; Osler’s nodes are identified on his fingers and toes  and Roth spots are found during the eye exam. Petechiae are present on the lower extremities.  - Labs: Elevated WBC  ESR  and CRP. Blood cultures positive after 24 hours. Hemoglobin slightly low  could suggest anemia possibly related to chronic disease. - Imaging: Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) reveals a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   Diagnosis: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  This patient fits within the typical demographic for native-valve infective endocarditis. Current literature suggests that men are more likely to be affected than women  specifically in a ratio of about 2:1. The disease is also more common amongst older adults. The conditions leading to this concern can be tied back to his underlying cardiovascular disease (hypertension) and his advanced age. His diabetes mellitus does not help as it affects the immune system’s ability to fight infections. His clinical profile and investigative findings corroborate quite well with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,58,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Daniel Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Living conditions: Lives with wife  non-smoker  occasional alcohol intake. Insurance: Medicare  Presenting Problem: Mr. Daniel has non-specific symptoms which have been ongoing for 3 weeks  including fatigue  night sweats  loss of appetite  and weight loss. He has also noted a low-grade fever.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Chronic kidney disease stage III: Managed conservatively. 2. Prostate cancer: Treated and in remission for 3 years. 3.

Physical Examination: Vital signs: Fever of 101 F  Blood pressure: 135/85 mmHg  Heart rate: 95 bpm  Respiratory rate: 16/min  Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air. Cardiac exam: New early diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Skin exam: No signs of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions. Neurological examination: No neurological deficits.  It is suspected that the patient's symptoms may be due to native-valve infective endocarditis  which has an incidence rate of 5 per 100 000 individuals  and is most commonly seen in older males. In addition  diabetes and kidney disease are potential risk factors for this condition.   Plan: 1. Blood cultures: To confirm if there's an ongoing infection. 2. Echocardiogram: To visualize any vegetations or abscesses that would suggest infective endocarditis.  3. Consult infectious disease specialist: If diagnosis is confirmed to guide antibiotic therapy.  The above representation allows us to examine this patient's condition in the broad context of his overall health picture  and to accurately represent him in comparison to other similar patients in the literature.

Atorvastatin - 40mg once daily  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Recent investigations:   Blood tests revealed an increased white cell count and CRP. Blood cultures have been taken and are pending. ECG showed no abnormalities. Chest X-ray was normal.   Immunization History:   Up to date on all vaccines.   This profile suggests a relatively common demographic for the patient population presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis as per literature  demonstrating some of the common underlying conditions and predisposing factors such as diabetes  hypertension  age above 50  and coronary artery disease history.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,60,Patient Profile: Name: Carl Gender: Male  Age: 67  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Location: Rural Midwestern U.S.  Patient Presentation: Carl has presented with a low-grade fever  fatigue  and a new heart murmur that wasn't noticed during his last checkup a few months ago. Additionally  he also complained of unexplained weight loss  night sweats  and has noticed small blood spots under the nails.   Past Medical History: Carl is moderately overweight  with a BMI of 29. He has type 2 diabetes for the past decade which has been generally managed through dietary changes and oral medication. He suffers from hypertension and has a history of smoking about 10 cigarettes a day from age 20 to 55 at which point he quit.  He visited his dentist two months back for a tooth extraction without prophylactic antibiotics. Two years ago  he had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) due to gallstones. He does not have any known allergies to drugs.  Epidemiology Connection: According to published epidemiological studies  individuals over the age of 60 have a higher incidence of native-valve infective endocarditis. Risk is also magnified by the presence of pre-existing conditions like diabetes and a history of invasive procedures like tooth extraction or surgeries. Male gender and previous smoking history are also associated with increased risk. This patient's representation reflects these epidemiological findings.  In addition  the patient’s rural location may contribute to a delay in diagnosis due to limited access to specialized healthcare services.  Problem Representation: This 67-year-old diabetic  hypertensive  and ex-smoker Caucasian man presented with symptoms of low-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  new onset heart murmur  and petechiae in the nail beds  raising the strong suspicion of infective endocarditis  likely linked to the dental extraction a few months ago. His age  male gender  and history of smoking add to the risk. Prompt investigation and management are needed to confirm the diagnosis and prevent disease progression and its complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,61,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Name: Patient X (to maintain anonymity) Gender: Male Age: 65 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Urban area  living alone Occupity: Retired schoolteacher  Demographic Details: According to literature  males over the age of 60  particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity are more susceptible to native-valve infective endocarditis. Our patient Patient X  falls in this demographic group.   He lives alone in an urban area which mandates frequent medical follow-ups  especially considering his medical history and susceptibility to infections. As a retired individual  he has sufficient time for regular clinical check-ups  though it might be challenging due to mobility issues.   Medical History: Patient X has a past medical history of type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last 15 years and has been managing it with oral hypoglycemics. He also has chronic kidney disease stage III for the past 5 years.   He had been diagnosed with rheumatic fever at the age of 12 which led to mild mitral valve regurgitation  making him more prone to infective endocarditis.   Three years ago  he suffered from a urinary tract infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus  a common pathogen implicated in infective endocarditis.  Current Presentation: Presently  he complains of fatigue  low-grade fever  chills  night sweats  and shortness of breath. On auscultation  a new cardiac murmur was detected  indicating the possibility of infective endocarditis.   Planned Investigations: Given patient’s symptoms and past medical history  further investigations  including blood cultures and an echocardiography  are planned to confirm the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Patient's adherence to follow-up visits and medication regimen will be crucial in managing and treating this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,62,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 60 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Socioeconomic Status: Middle-class Occupation: Retired  previous job exposed him to unsanitary conditions  Main problem: Presenting with symptoms consistent with native valve infective endocarditis  Medical history:  1. Recent bacterial infection 2. History of mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation 3. Weak immune system due to Type II diabetes  4. No prosthetic implants or devices 5. History of Intravenous drug abuse 20 years ago. Sober for the last 15 years.  Symptoms: 1. Unexplained fever and night sweats for the past two weeks 2. Shortness of breath exacerbated by mild physical exertion 3. Palpitations and chest discomfort 4. Loss of appetite and associated weight loss 5. Fatigue 6. Evidence of vascular phenomena including petechiae and Janeway lesions  Physical examination: 1. Low-grade fever 2. Murmur noted on cardiac auscultation indicative of preexisting mitral valve disease 3. Shortness of breath during examination  Social history: 1. Lives alone 2. Does not smoke or consume alcohol 3. Sedentary lifestyle  Sexual history:  1. Monogamous  last sexual encounter 3 months ago 2. No history of sexually transmitted diseases  Travel history: 1. No recent travel  This patient’s history reveals multiple risk factors for native valve infective endocarditis including advanced age  male sex  prior mitral valve disease  immune system weakened by diabetes  and a past history of intravenous drug abuse. It is recommended that further diagnostic tests are performed  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram. It is anticipated that the patient will require therapeutic interventions like antibiotics and potentially surgical options.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,63,Patient Profile  Patient's Name: González  Carlos Age: 45  Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Mechanic  Medical History:   1. Prior History: Mr. González had a rheumatic fever at the age of 15 which has caused some damage to his heart valves. Since then  his doctor has regularly monitored his heart health  but no significant issues have been reported.  2. No History of Drug Abuse: Mr. González does not smoke or use illicit drugs. He also reports not drinking alcohol in excess.  3. Co-morbid Conditions: Mr. González has type-2 diabetes  which has been poorly controlled due to issues with medication adherence.   Recent Presentation:   Recently  Mr. González has been experiencing symptoms including intermittent fever  fatigue  and night sweats over the past three weeks. He also reports shortness of breath  especially when lying flat  and evident weight loss. A recent visit to the local ER revealed a new-onset heart murmur which prompted further testing  led to the suspicion of infective endocarditis.  Relevant Lab and Imaging Results:  Blood cultures report growth of Streptococcus oralis  agreeing with the suspected diagnosis of infective endocarditis. An Echocardiogram confirmed vegetations on his heart valves.  Social History:  Mr. González has four children and lives with his wife in urban housing. As a mechanic  he frequently comes into contact with dust  chemicals and other potentially harmful substances.  Assessment and Plan:  Mr. González appears to fit the demographic profile for a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis. His prior history of rheumatic fever  along with his uncontrolled diabetes  puts him at increased risk of this condition. His recent symptoms  lab results  and imaging findings strongly suggest this as an accurate diagnosis. For a successful outcome  a treatment plan encompassing management of his endocarditis and better control of his diabetes is already underway. This includes immediate hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics and follow-ups for potential heart valve surgery if required. His diabetes management will be reconsidered once the infective endocarditis is under control.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,64,Patient Problem Representation:  Patient Identification: A 60-year-old male Caucasian patient.  Chief Complaint: High-grade fever for 10 days  accompanying malaise  dizziness  and shortness of breath.  Present History: The patient has been feeling unwell for around 10 days with a high-grade fever that doesn't seem to come down with over-the-counter medications. He has also mentioned that he feels fatigued  dizzy  and short of breath  especially on exertion. Furthermore  he has also noticed the sudden onset of small  dark red spots on the whites of the eyes and inside the cheeks.  Past Medical History: He has a known case of rheumatic fever in his early 20s  for which he was treated but neglected follow-up. He also has a history of sporadic intravenous drug abuse 15 years ago  although he claims he has not used drugs for the past 10 years. No known allergies were reported.   Family History: Father died at 56 of a myocardial infarction. His mother is alive and has hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has one brother who is healthy.  Social history: He is a truck driver  a smoker with 20-pack years history  and consumes alcohol only on social occasions.   Review of Systems: He does not have any complaints of chest pain  cough  palpitations  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  rash  joint pain  or weight loss. There is no recent history of traveling  no sick contacts  and no known exposure to communicable diseases.  On the basis of the given demographic and clinical profile  the next steps would be to delve deeper into his complaints  starting with the most prominent symptom – persistent high-grade fever. Physical examination and subsequent necessary diagnostic tests  such as blood culture  ECHO  and CBC among others  will be valuable in confirming the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient's history of rheumatic fever  intravenous drug abuse  and his heavy smoking habit puts him at higher risk of this condition. It is equally critical to begin prompt treatment to mitigate the risk of life-threatening complications.   References and other sources could contain demographic distributions that may guide the representation. For instance  infective endocarditis is more prevalent in male populations  peaking in those aged between 30 and 60  which aligns with this case. Furthermore  the history related to cardiac disease (rheumatic fever) and drug use are also commonly associated with an increased risk of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,65,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  married with two adult children  and residing in an urban setting.  Presenting Problem:  The patient presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  night sweats  fatigue  and unexpected weight loss.   Relevant Past Medical History:  1. History of bicuspid aortic valve detected through echocardiogram 5 years ago - no intervention was deemed necessary at the time. 2. Patient had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction 7 years ago  treated with coronary stent placement. 3. Regular follow-up for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes a daily dosage of Lisinopril 10mg and Rosuvastatin 20mg respectively. 4. Underwent extraction of two lower molar teeth 3 months ago. 5. No history of injection drug use.  Demographic considerations:  According to the literature  males are affected more often than females  particularly those aged 61 and older (4:1 ratio). Infective endocarditis is currently most common in Caucasians  particularly in the elderly population due to increasing age and prevalence of degenerative valve disease and healthcare-associated infections. Urban dwellers seem to show higher prevalence probably due to ready access to healthcare services leading to better diagnosis.  Habitual Factors:  The patient is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate alcohol intake. Maintains a relatively active lifestyle with regular low-intensity workouts.  Family History:  Father died in his late 70s from complications related to coronary heart disease. Mother is currently in her 80s and has Alzheimer's disease. No family history of heart valve disease or endocarditis reported.  Social History:  He lives with his wife. Both children live out of state and visit occasionally. Patient retired 5 years ago from being an elementary school teacher.  Assessment:  Considering the advanced age  male gender  history of bicuspid aortic valve  recent dental procedure  and the ongoing symptoms  the patient could be at risk for native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient should undergo further diagnostic procedures including blood cultures and echocardiogram to determine necessary treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,66,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Mr. James  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presents with persistent high-grade fever of 2 weeks duration  loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. Also reports of sweating  especially at night  and generalized body malaise. An engineer by profession  he denies any recent travel or exposure to any potential infectious substances  but admits to have been a smoker for the past 30 years.  Past Medical History:   James has a known case of Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years  which is currently managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) 5 years back  for which he underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. His last cardiac evaluation was 2 years ago. James also had rheumatoid arthritis and was on prolonged steroids but had stopped the medications 6 months ago. No known drug allergies.   Family History:   Father died of a myocardial infarction in his early 60s and mother is alive with hypertension.  Relevant History:  James also reports of having dental caries for which he did not seek any medical help; inference might hold key to possible diagnosis of infective endocarditis as certain oral bacteria can cause this condition. He also has experienced joint pains and swelling for the past couple of weeks.  Social History:   James lives with his wife and two children. He works as an engineer and travel to work by car. He has been a regular smoker for the last 30 years and denies any illicit drugs or alcohol use.   Demographic characterization of James is in accordance with available demographic representation for normal native-valve endocarditis in literature  i.e.  predominantly affects males in their late 50s or early 60s  quite often smokers  suffering from a cardiac condition  diabetes or any condition warranting long-term immunosuppressants such as steroids. These conditions make valves more susceptible to bacterial infection. Thus  making diabetes  coronary artery disease  dental issues  and history of rheumatoid arthritis relevant to diagnose the case of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,67,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 60-year-old caucasian male who has a history of intravenous drug use  which is the most common risk factor for native-valve infective endocarditis. He is retired and lives alone. His daily activities include cooking for himself  a moderate walking routine and socializing with his friends at a nearby community center. He is a high school graduate and worked as a construction worker until retirement. He has Medicare for health insurance. He is known to smoke 10 cigarettes per day and is working on quitting.  Past Medical History: This patient has a significant past medical history for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a prior episode of infective endocarditis 5 years ago. His hypertension and diabetes mellitus have been controlled with medication. He also has a history of moderate renal impairment from long standing diabetes. He takes Lisinopril  Metformin  Aspirin and Insulin.  Presenting Problem: The patient has been brought into the hospital presenting with persistent fever for the past 10 days  associated with chills  sweating  discomfort in the chest  and poor appetite. He also reports fatigue  a cough that has persisted for two weeks  and increasing shortness of breath  especially when lying flat.  Initial Assessment: The initial physical examination reveals a systolic heart murmur  Janeway's lesions on his palms and soles  and Osler's nodes on his fingers. Other signs present are pallor and moderate respiratory distress. These symptoms  combined with his past medical history and demographics  suggest the diagnosis of a recurrence of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Public Health Relevance: Invasive medical procedures  intravenous drug abuse  dental procedures  and some other forms of exposure can increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis. Concurrent conditions such as diabetes and renal impairment in our patient further complicate the scenario. Infective endocarditis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates; hence  early recognition  diagnosis and management is crucial to reduce these adverse outcomes. Identification of high-risk patients  appropriate prophylaxis  and management of modifiable risk factors in time can significantly reduce the risk of endocarditis. Comprehensive patient education on good dental hygiene  controlling diabetes  not sharing needles  and the importance of regular medical follow-ups would also contribute to this end.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,68,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: 60-year-old male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Farmer  Living Conditions: Lives alone in a rural area  Presenting Problem: The patient has presented with a one-month history of persistent fever  night sweats  weight loss  and fatigue. He reports a worsening medium-intensity heart murmur and has started to experience difficulties with concentration and coordination. There have been no reported incidences of drug use  dentistry procedures  or other invasive techniques in the recent past. The patient also complains of painful red skin nodules and small tender lumps in the pad of the fingers.  Demographic Characteristics: According to the literature  the majority of cases of native-valve infective endocarditis occur in males over 50 years old  mainly of Caucasian ethnicity. The over-representation of males may be due to certain risk factors such as a history of intravenous drug use which is more common in males. However  our patient does not fit this risk factor. Literature also represents cases in farmers or individuals exposed to livestock  due to the potential exposure to zoonotic pathogens.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis and had a mechanical valve replacement two years ago. He also has a history of ischemic heart disease  hypercholesterolemia  and hypertension. There is no history of immunodeficiency disease  congenital heart disease  intravenous drug use  alcoholism  or homelessness. The patient has had occasional dental carries but has always maintained good oral hygiene.  Family History: His father had endocarditis and passed away due to congestive heart failure at the age of 70 years old. His mother has hypertension but is otherwise healthy. No reports of heart diseases in siblings.  Disease Information: Native-valve infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves and the endocardium that is not related to intravenous drug use and other direct infections. It typically occurs in individuals over 50 with a previous history of heart valve disease  rheumatic heart disease  and congenital heart defects. Underlying heart disease is an important element of risk. The main causative agents are Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species  and in some cases  organisms that are part of normal human flora.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,69,Problem Representation:  Age: 40-60 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Socioeconomic status: Low to middle income Occupation: Manual laborer  Presenting Complaint:  Patient comes in with complaints of fever for a few weeks  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and a new heart murmur.  History of Present Illness:  On further probing  the patient reports that the symptoms started with a mild fever which gradually became high-grade over the last 2-3 weeks. The patient also reports experiencing more fatigue than usual  night sweats  and unintended weight loss. He has noticed a decrease in his appetite. He is also experiencing shortness of breath upon exertion. No history of recent dental procedures  skin infections or intravenous drug use; no recent travel history.  Past Medical History: No significant past medical history is reported. There are no known allergies. The patient does not report any history of congenital heart disease. There is no history of rheumatic fever  or heart disease. The patient denies any history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Family History:  The family history is non-contributory  with no known immediate family members having cardiac or rheumatic diseases.  Social History:  The patient lives with his partner and has two children. He is a non-smoker and denies any regular alcohol use. His job involves manual labor.  Physical Examination:  The patient is febrile with a temperature of 38.5 C. On auscultation  a new heart murmur is detected. The remainder of his physical examination is unremarkable.  Clinical queries: Based on the above information  the main concern is native-valve infective endocarditis  given the constellation of symptoms and the identification of a new heart murmur. The patient's age and sex are consistent with average patients who have native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient's occupation involving manual labor could potentially lead to incidences of minor unattended trauma leading to entry paths for bacteria. The patient does not have any overt risk factors like congenital heart disease  previous valve disease  or intravenous drug use. Further investigations and hospital admission for intravenous antibiotic therapy are considered.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,70,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 60 years Gender: Men Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Plumber  Lifestyle: Moderate alcohol consumption and smoking  Presenting Problem:   John Doe has presented today with severe  unrelenting fever  chills  and generalized body aches. He has also experienced sudden weight loss  night sweats  and fatigue for the last couple of weeks. He occasionally reports experiencing shortness of breath  especially after moderate physical activity.  Relevant Medical History:   John was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse 5 years ago  for which he has been on regular medications. He also has hypertension controlled by medication  with a history of intermittent adherence to prescribed medications. He was treated for streptococcal pharyngitis three months ago. There is also a history of multiple dental procedures for which prophylactic antibiotics were inconsistently used. There is no history of intravenous drug use.  Past Surgeries: John underwent an appendectomy about 10 years ago.  Family Medical History: John's father had coronary artery disease and his mother had diabetes.  Current Medications:   - Metoprolol for mitral valve prolapse treatment and hypertension control  - Aspirin for cardiovascular health  Allergies: John says he is allergic to penicillin  which causes skin rashes.  Physical Examination:   On examination  his heart rate is high (tachycardia)  with a newly identified heart murmur. His temperature is 101°F. There are also small  tender  red or purple spots (Osler's nodes) present on his fingertips and toes  and his nails show evidence of splinter-like hemorrhages.  Blood Tests:   Blood cultures and other relevant tests have been ordered to confirm the suspicion of infective endocarditis and its probable bacterial etiology.  This patient’s case represents a fairly typical presentation of a patient with infective endocarditis. The demographic characteristics and past medical history aligns well with what is typically seen in these cases. The demographic details follow the pattern in the literature which often highlights patients with heart valve diseases  poor adherence to medications  inconsistent antibiotic prophylaxis use  and certain lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol consumption as being at higher risk for endocarditis.

Dental health history: Patient X has poor oral hygiene with multiple dental caries and a history of prior dental procedures without antibiotic prophylaxis.  History of drug use: He is a former intravenous drug user who quit 2 years ago.  Recent travel history: No history of recent overseas travel or exposure to risk factors for unusual organisms  By incorporating above information  a unique health outline of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis is created that can guide focused medical history taking  targeted physical examination  and streamline the diagnostic and management plan. Even though individually none of these factors would necessarily lead to the condition  the combination of age  gender  lifestyle choices  occupational exposure  socioeconomic status  genetic predisposition  and specifically previous valvular heart disease and poor dental health increase the risk for infective endocarditis. This suggests need of a high index of suspicion in a similar presenting case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,72,Patient Profile:   - Name: Patient X - Gender: Male - Age: 50 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Construction worker - Marital Status: Single - Smoking History: Past smoker  quit 5 years ago - Alcohol Use: Moderate drinking  2-3 times a week - Drug Use: History of intravenous drug use  Medical History:  - Past history of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infection  presented as skin abscess last year - High blood pressure  regulated by medication - History of chronic renal insufficiency - Past history of intravenous drug use  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. X is presenting with intermittent fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  loss of appetite  and unexplained weight loss for over three weeks. Along with these  he also complains of heart palpitations  a new heart murmur  and shortness of breath. Mr. X  who is a construction worker by trade  expresses concern over the fact that he has been feeling easily tired and has difficulty carrying out his daily tasks since these symptoms started. There are no noticeable changes in sleep pattern or bowel habits.  Clinical Suspicion:  With a past history of MRSA infection and intravenous drug use  and currently experiencing symptoms such as fever  chills  heart murmur  and fatigue  the clinical suspicion lies towards the possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis stratifying him as a high-risk patient for this condition.  Investigations to Confirm Diagnosis:  - Blood cultures: To identify the causative organism - Chest X-ray: To look for any signs of heart failure - ECG: To identify any abnormal heart rhythms - Echocardiography: To visualize the heart valves and check for any vegetation or abnormalities  Management Plan:  The plan would be to start empirical antibiotic therapy  pending blood culture results  to control the infection. Also  the patient's blood pressure management and renal insufficiency must be revisited  as both contribute to the overall risk factor for infective endocarditis. Importantly  efforts should be made toward secondary prevention  including counselling about harm reduction in relation to his history of intravenous drug use. More definitive management would be decided upon the final diagnosis following the full result of his investigations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,73,Patient Representation:  Gender: Male Age: 65 Race: Caucasian  Medical History:  1. Previous history of congenital heart disease  specifically a bicuspid aortic valve  repaired via surgery in the past. 2. Previous invasive dental procedures with suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis. 3. Chronic renal disease- patient has been on maintenance hemodialysis for the past 5 years. 4. History of intravenous drug use in the patient's earlier years. 5. History of alcohol abuse and resulting liver cirrhosis. 6. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus Type II  typically managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. 7. Recurrent urinary tract infections possibly due to urinary catheterization.  Presenting Complaints:  1. Fever of unknown origin for the past couple of weeks. 2. Fatigue and unintentional weight loss. 3. New murmur detected on routine auscultation suggestive of valvular disease. 4. Symptoms of heart failure like shortness of breath  edema in lower limbs. 5. Recent onset confusion and weakness in one side of the body  indicative of septic emboli or stroke. 6. Blood culture positive for Streptococcus viridans.  Given this representation  the patient's demographic profile and medical history make him a high-risk individual for native valve infective endocarditis. The pathogens causing endocarditis are usually from the Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species  the former associated with dental procedures and the latter more commonly found in intravenous drug users. The patient's diabetic condition  renal dialysis  and prior heart valve issues also increase the risk and complexity of treatment. Other potential complications like stroke or septic emboli also need urgent neurological consultation and intervention. The patient's alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis would further complicate the overall management and prognosis.

The patient also experiences occasional discomfort in the chest and shortness of breath.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of intravenous (IV) drug use and was previously hospitalized for drug-related complications. He also has a history of smoking and drinking alcohol. Has a history of poor dental hygiene leading to recurring episodes of gingivitis and untreated dental caries. Had a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease in the past and also suffers from an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia).  Family Medical History: There is a family history of cardiovascular conditions  specifically heart disease.  Social History: The patient lives in an urban setting and has poor living conditions. He has a history of unemployment and struggles with addiction.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient appears unwell  is febrile  and shows signs of malnutrition. Auscultation reveals a heart murmur. There are small red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)  the whites of the eyes (scleral icterus) are slightly yellow  and there are small tender lumps on the fingers or toes (Osler's nodes).  Problem Representation:  A patient in his late 50s with a history of intravenous drug use  poor dental hygiene  and heart disease  presents with symptoms indicative of infective endocarditis – such as persistent low-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats. Clinical signs such as a heart murmur  petechiae  scleral icterus  and Osler's nodes further support this suspicion. His social conditions and lifestyle choices - including struggles with addiction - complicate his clinical profile. Considering his personal medical history  clinical presentation  and the family history of cardiovascular disease  the focus will be on confirming the diagnosis and overseeing the management of native valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,75,Patient Profile:  Name - John Doe Age - 60 years old Gender - Male Ethnicity - Non-Hispanic White Occupation - Retired Teacher Lifestyle - Non-smoker  Non-alcoholic  Limited physical activity Residence - Urban middle-income neighborhood  Clinical History: John Doe has a past medical history significant for Rheumatic Heart Disease that was diagnosed two decades ago. This has led to the development of a mitral valve regurgitation which was identified in a regular follow-up around four years back. Although advised surgical intervention at the time  the patient declined having mitral valve replacement. Patient has been on regular medications including anticoagulants and anti-rheumatic drugs.   Current Presentation: John presents to the clinic today complaining of consistent fever for the past two weeks accompanied by fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. On further inquiry  he reports occasional chest pain and shortness of breath.  Clinical Speculation: Based on the above features combined with his past medical history of rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve pathology  there is a high suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis. This is further necessitated due to the chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of a heart murmur on physical examination.   Differential Diagnosis: Native Valve Endocarditis Rheumatic Heart Disease Flare-Up Congestive Heart Failure  Further Investigation Plan: Given the suspected diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis  further investigations will include blood cultures to identify causal organisms  complete blood count to assess the level of infection  Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein for inflammatory markers and an echocardiogram to visualize the valves and look for vegetations.   Treatment Plan: Pending test results  the initial treatment will include empirical antibiotic therapy with broad-spectrum coverage  closely monitor the patient's response  and then adjust the therapy as necessary once the pathogen is identified and sensitivities are known.   Follow-up: Patient will need to have regular cardiology follow-ups to assess the progression of infective endocarditis and also to assess the status of pre-existing rheumatic heart disease. A specialist's assessment regarding the need for a delayed surgical intervention for the pre-existing mitral regurgitation or any complication from infective endocarditis like heart failure or valve perforation would also be important.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,76,Patient Problem Representation:  Demographics: A 64-year-old Caucasian male  retired  living in a suburban area with his wife.

Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and his mother is a known case of type 2 diabetes. He has an elder sister  alive and well  with no significant illnesses.   Social History: The patient is a retired engineer  married with two children  non-drinker  but a heavy smoker.  Medications: His only regular medication is a once-daily dose of Metoprolol 50 mg for hypertension.  Allergies: No known drug allergies.   Physical Exam: On examination  the patient appears unwell. The temperature is noted to be 38.9 degrees Celsius  pulse 90 bpm  respiratory rate 18/min  and blood pressure 140/90 mmHg. Valvular heart sound suggestive of a murmur is present. Skin exam reveals Janeway lesions on his palms.  Working Diagnosis: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis – Given the history of persistent  high-grade fever coupled with a murmur heard on auscultation  history of dental procedure possibly leading to bacteremia  and peripheral signs like Janeway lesions.   Need for further Investigations: Blood Cultures  Echocardiogram (both transthoracic and transesophageal) and complete blood cortisol for a definitive diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,77,Patient Profile: Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old African-American male with presenting symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE). He lives in an urban community and worked throughout his life as an electrician.   Presenting Symptoms: John has been feeling generally unwell for the past three weeks with intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  shortness of breath and unintentional weight loss. He has also noticed some strange red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet.   Past Medical History: John is a smoker with a 30-pack-year history. He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension for which he has been on medication for the last 10 years. He also has a history of Rheumatic Fever as a child but no history of intravenous drug use.  Family History: His mother died at an elderly age due to complications from chronic heart disease. His sister has a history of stroke and his father died from prostate cancer.   Social History: John is a retiree and lives with his wife. He has never used illicit drugs  drinks alcohol socially  and has a 40-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily. He denies any recent travels or any known exposure to infectious diseases.  Physical Examination: He appears chronically ill. His temperature is 38.2 degrees Celsius. His blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  pulse 88 beats per minute  and respiration rate is 18 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination reveals a new murmur. Other physical examination findings were normal.  Laboratory Findings:  His complete blood count (CBC) indicates mild anemia and leukocytosis. Blood cultures are pending.  Considering the presenting symptoms  along with John's medical and social history  the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis is strongly suspected. His age  gender  race  and history of smoking and hypertension  place him within the demographic group often found in literature to be at higher risk.  Further diagnostic testing such as echocardiograms and additional blood cultures would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. The patient would also require education about the disease  potential complications  and lifestyle modifications necessary for recovery and prevention of recurrence.

Continuation of current medications for hypertension and diabetes. Much depending on the echocardiogram results  cardiology consultation for possible valve surgery should also be considered.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,82,Patient Profile: Patient AA is a 58-year-old white male with past medical history of chronic rheumatic heart disease and intravenous drug use.  Chief Complaint: 3-week history of fatigue  fluctuating low-grade fever  night sweats  weight loss  and a new heart murmur.  History of Present Illness: The patient started feeling unwell approximately 3 weeks ago with symptoms including fatigue  mild fever which fluctuates throughout the day  excessive sweating during the night  and noticeable weight loss. The patient's condition has continued to deteriorate  prompting him to seek medical help.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of rheumatic heart disease and has been advised on multiple occasions to visit his cardiologist regularly for examinations. However  due to his lifestyle choices  non-compliance is evident. He is also an active intravenous drug user  which increases his risk of developing life-threatening infections.   Social History: The patient admits to currently using illegal drugs intravenously. He does not have a stable home environment and often stays in shelters or on the streets. He denies alcohol or tobacco use.  Family History: There is no known family history of rheumatic heart disease or other heart diseases.   Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared to be in mild distress. Temperature was elevated mildly  with a new audible heart murmur on cardiac examination. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable.  Problem Representation or Assessment: In the context of the patient’s known underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease  intravenous drug use  and new symptoms suggestive of systemic infection including fever  fatigue  and new heart murmur  the patient appears to have a presentation consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Plan: The patient should be admitted for intravenous antibiotics and further evaluation and diagnosis. Blood cultures to identify the causative organism and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any valve damage are important next steps. Due to the patient’s complicated social situation  consultation for social work services to assist in a safe discharge plan will also be necessary. Neurology consult may be needed in case of embolic events.    NOTE: it is vital for the treatment that the patient stops using illicit intravenous drugs. He needs medical support to overcome his addiction to prevent future similar episodes. Hence  planning for referral to dedicated drug abuse counselling/therapy after hospital discharge is also important.   Demographic Representation Note: The median age at presentation for native valve endocarditis has been described in the literature as middle-aged to elderly  with a male predominance. Substance abuse  in particular intravenous drug use  is one of the noted risk factors  particularly in developed countries. Rheumatic heart disease is a known predisposing factor to infective endocarditis. This scenario depicts a typical patient with native valve endocarditis.

Problem Representation:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male former injecting drug user with a past medical history of rheumatic fever and poor oral hygiene. He presents with chronic low-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and new-onset shortness of breath. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor oral hygiene; he reports a dental procedure 6 months ago without antibiotic prophylaxis.  Clinical Suspicion: This proposed medical profile and history aligns with the typical presentation of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,86,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Stevens Age: 56 years old Gender: Sex Race: Caucasian Occupation: Corporate employee Marital Status: Married with 2 kids  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Stevens has been feeling unwell for the past several weeks  experiencing symptoms such as fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and an unexplained loss of weight. Upon physical examination and echocardiography  he is found to have a heart murmur which suggested a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Medical History:   - Mr. Stevens was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago which has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. - He has a history of hypertension for the past 7 years  controlled with a daily dose of antihypertensive medication. - He underwent tooth extraction 3 months ago.  Family History:   - Father passed away from congestive heart failure at age 62. - Mother is living and diagnosed with type II diabetes.  Social History:  - Mr. Stevens is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol socially. He has an overall sedentary lifestyle due his desk job.  - His diet is poorly controlled due to his busy schedule with frequent intake of fast food.  Relevant Clinical Examination and Tests:  Upon examination  there is a presence of petechia on his extremities and Janeway lesions. Heart Auscultation shows a new regurgitant murmur suggestive of mitral valve regurgitation. An Echocardiogram confirms presence of mitral valve vegetations. Blood cultures are drawn to identify the causative organism.  Based on a review of recent literature  this case is consistent with typical demographic and clinical findings in patients with native-valve infective endocarditis. According to existing studies  the average age of patients presenting with this condition often falls within the fifth or sixth decades. Males are more commonly afflicted than females  and the presence of an identifiable portal of entry such as a recent dental procedure is also quite common. The presence of underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension may also predispose to the development of endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,87,Patient Profile: - Sex: Male - Age: 65 years old  - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  Relevant Past Medical History: - 15 years of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes  with irregular follow-ups - Hypertension for 10 years  under medication  - Had mild stroke two years ago with complete recovery - Occasional alcohol use - Social smoker  5-8 cigarettes a day for the past 30 years - History of dental abscess 1 month ago  underwent minor dental procedure without antibiotic prophylaxis   Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a two-week history of on-going  unexplained  fluctuating fever  malaise  weakness  and an unintentional weight loss. He also reports having night sweats  and is found to have a new heart murmur on physical examination.  Problem Representation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a long history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and hypertension  who underwent a minor dental procedure a month ago without antibiotic prophylaxis. He now presents with a 2-week history of unexplained  fluctuating fever  malaise  weakness  and unintentional weight loss along with new onset heart murmur. As the patient has both the potential for a bacteremia from the dental procedure and vulnerable valvular endothelium from chronic unregulated hyperglycemia  the working diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,88,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   A 60-year-old Caucasian male  social drinker  and smoker  with no history of intravenous drug use. He works as a farmer. He has been living with his spouse and has a long-standing history of poor oral hygiene.   Past Medical History:   The patient has a significant medical history of diabetes mellitus and rheumatic heart disease. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents. He was also diagnosed with rheumatic fever during his adolescence and developed subsequent rheumatic heart disease due to raised anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers. Because of the compromised heart function  he has been on long-term oral penicillin prophylaxis. He has no history of any invasive medical or surgical procedures.  Presentation:  The patient complains of a one-month history of intermittent high-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  and night sweats. Physical examination reveals the presence of a new regurgitant heart murmur suspected to be due to valvular insufficiency. An initial set of blood cultures has been drawn and he has been started on empirical antibiotic therapy. However  fever and other symptoms persist even after seven days of appropriate antibiotic therapy.   The echocardiogram shows evidence of vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of native valve endocarditis. The blood culture result shows growth of Streptococcus viridians.  Problem List:  1. Native valve infective endocarditis (suspected  bacterial cultures positive). 2. Diabetes mellitus (managed with oral hypoglycemic agents). 3. Rheumatic heart disease (with resulting valvular pathology). 4. Poor oral hygiene (risk factor for infective endocarditis). 5. History of smoking and social drinking. 6. History of fever  malaise  weight loss  and night sweats.  7. New regurgitant heart murmur (high suspicion of valvular insufficiency due to endocarditis). 8. No history of invasive medical procedures or intravenous drug use. 9. Living in a rural area with possible exposure to zoonoses.  This problem representation covers a typical case of a patient with a native valve endocarditis. It not only includes the patient's demographic representation but also encompasses an evaluation of personal habits  job  and residential area. Moreover  it takes into account the suspected etiological agent wildly found in oral flora  and the existence of a pre-existing heart condition which correlates with literature  placing these patients at higher risk.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,89,Problem Representation:  Demographics: We are dealing with a 60-year-old male patient who is a habitual smoker and has a history of diabetes and hypertension. He is Hispanic  living in an urban environment  is unemployed and lacks means of self-care.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (properly controlled with metformin 500 mg twice daily for the last 10 years)  Hypertension (controlled with Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for the last 15 years)  and tobacco use disorder (the patient reports a habit of daily smoking 1.5 packs of cigarettes for the last 40 years. Recently quit six months ago).  Presenting Symptoms: The individual has been suffering from fatigue  unexplained weight loss  low-grade fever with chills and sweats  and has recently developed a murmur in his heart. Shortness of breath on exertion and an abnormally rapid heart rate are other symptoms experienced. Over the last month  there have been recurrent episodes of blood in urine  and new vascular lesions on the palms and soles.  Diagnosis: Given the symptoms  as well as his murmurs characteristic of new valvular regurgitation and presence of Janeway lesions  the patient has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. His diagnosis has been confirmed with positive blood cultures and echocardiography showing valvular vegetation.  Management Plan:  The patient has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy  pending results of culture sensitivity. Glycemic control is being managed with insulin  considering his severe infectious state. Smoking cessation therapy is continued. The patient will also need regular monitoring for complications of endocarditis like rokes or other embolic events  heart failure  spread of infection or abscess formation  and renal failure.   This problem representation is based on the clinically-relevant factors from literature associated with infective endocarditis. However  actual presentations may vary based on unique patient characteristics and comorbidities.

Richard also reports fatigue  night sweats  loss of appetite  and weight loss.   Past Medical History:   1. Was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus type II eight years ago  poor glycemic control despite medication (Metformin). 2. Suffered from Rheumatic Heart Disease in childhood but has not had any episodes for the past 30 years. 3. Has a history of periodontal disease. 4. Had a dental procedure done 3 weeks ago. 5. Used intravenous drugs in his youth. 6. A history of frequent infections  especially respiratory ones.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  he had splenomegaly and presence of skin lesions  suspecting Osler nodes.  Epidemiology: According to medical literature  men are predisposed to native-valve infective endocarditis more than women. It is more common among older adults (over 50 years old) and particularly in those with a history of heart disease  immune disorders  or valve damage.  Problem Representation: This patient presents multiple risk factors for developing native valve infective endocarditis including his diabetes  history of rheumatic heart disease  poor dental health  previous drug usage  and frequent infections. His current symptoms of fever  a new heart murmur  fatigue  weight loss  and the presence of Osler nodes further strengthens the likelihood of infective endocarditis. He falls within the demographic most likely to suffer from this condition and needs immediate medical intervention. His comorbidities like diabetes and previous heart disease would require careful management to ensure successful treatment. His presentation is representative of a typical person that falls within the demographic profile of those at risk for infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,94,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: A 60-year-old Caucasian male from a middle socioeconomic status.  Presenting Complaint: Patient presents with a three-week history of fever  malaise  and weight loss.  History: He reports the onset of mild  intermittent fever about 3 weeks ago  not relenting to simple antipyretics  accompanied by generalized fatigue and a significant unintended weight loss. He also reports night sweats and intermittent shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: He had undergone dental extraction 2 months ago. Otherwise  he doesn't record any significant past history  such as diabetes  hypertension  or heart disease. No previous history of intravenous drug use  blood-borne infections  or congenital heart disease.  Family and Social History: He lives alone; he was a smoker for 20 years  but quit 10 years ago. There's no relevant family history of congenital heart diseases.  Clinical findings: Upon examination  he displays a fever of 38.4°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal edge. There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. Full blood count: High white cell count; Blood cultures: Positive for Streptococcus viridans; Chest x-ray: Normal  Differential Diagnosis: Differential should include conditions presenting in a similar fashion such as lymphoma  HIV  tuberculosis  rheumatic fever and autoimmune diseases.  Probable Diagnosis: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE)  Issues for consideration: History of dental extraction promotes Streptococcus viridans bacteremia  potentially giving rise to native valve endocarditis. It's recommended hence to proceed with echocardiography to evaluate for vegetations on native valves. Introduction of antibiotics therapy specific to the cultured organism in blood should be considered. Arrangements for a consultation with the infectious disease and cardiology team are necessary.  Background: Native Valve Endocarditis (NVE) represents around 85-90% of all infective endocarditis cases. The majority of patients are male (60%)  and whilst it can arise at any age  it's more common in those over 50 years (median age is between 50-70 years). Most patients are Caucasian (80%) and of middle socioeconomic status. Other key risk factors include dental procedures which are known to cause temporary bacteremia.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,95,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male  employed as a construction worker  presents with symptoms that have developed over a period of several weeks.   Chief Complaints: The patient reports having a high-grade fever that is often intermittent but associated with nocturnal sweating. He also complains about fatigue  weight loss  and persistently feeling unwell.  Past Medical History: 1. Dental procedure around 1-2 months back  2. History of smoking and heavy alcohol consumption  3. Past medical history reveals Rheumatic fever at the age of 10  for which he underwent treatment.   Demographic Details: The patient is a resident of an urban dwelling  lives with his wife  and has 2 adult children. His diet is non-vegetarian  and he has a sedentary lifestyle. He occasionally travels for work around the country but has not reported any recent international travels.  Family History: Father had Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and died of a heart attack in his seventies. Mother died of breast cancer in her sixties. No known history of genetic disorders.   Social History: The patient reports no illicit drug use  no prison sentence  or sexual promiscuity.   According to literature  Caucasian males between ages 50-70 are at a most significant risk for infective endocarditis  especially with a background of cardiac disease  immunosuppressive therapy  prosthetic heart valves  or intravenous drug use. Increased risk has also been associated with jobs like construction work due to potential exposure to infections. Chronic alcoholism and smoking can impair immune function  rendering the patient susceptible to infections. a recent dental procedure could also lead to bacteremia  predisposing the patient to infective endocarditis.   In this particular case  the patient’s age  gender  smoking and alcohol habits  recent dental procedure  and history of cardiac disease all contribute to the risk of native valve infective endocarditis  which is consistent with the existing literature.

On Examination:  On clinical examination  he has an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border suggestive of aortic regurgitation which was not previously documented.  Relevant Investigations:  Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram shows vegetations on the aortic valve.  Problem Summary:  60-year-old high-risk individual with past intravenous drug use and significant chronic comorbidities of poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension  currently presenting with clinical symptoms  physical signs and investigations consistent with native valve infective endocarditis.  Plan:  Urgent referral to a cardiology specialist for management of suspected infective endocarditis  including initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy  cardiac evaluation for potential surgical intervention  optimizing management of chronic comorbidities  and referral to social work/services due to limited social support.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,97,Patient Profile: Name: John Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired   Chief Complaint: John presented with symptoms of fatigue  fever  and night sweats persisting for several weeks. Recently  he has also experienced shortness of breath during normal physical activities that he used to carry out comfortably.  Demographics: As per recent medical literature  infective endocarditis is more common in males  and the incidence increases with age  specifically those over 60 years old. Caucasians are also noted to be more prone to this condition.  Present Illness History: The onset of John's symptoms started with low-grade fever and fatigue about one and a half month ago. The fever was intermittent with poorly localized body aches. He later began to experience night sweats as well as a loss of appetite leading to weight loss. Recently  he has also been experiencing difficulty in breathing during normal activities.  Past Medical History: John has a history of degenerative heart disease  specifically aortic stenosis  and underwent a prosthetic valve replacement 10 years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago after 30 years of tobacco use. He also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for which he takes long-term immunosuppressive therapy.   Family History: John's family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His father died at 70 due to a myocardial infarction and his mother has chronic hypertension.  Social History:  John is a retired engineer  lives with his wife. He quit smoking 15 years back and consumes alcohol socially. He has two grown-up children who live out of town.  Given the patient's advanced age  male gender  history of heart valve surgery  long-term immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis  and the presence of typical symptoms  there is a high suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic tests such as blood culture and echocardiography may be ordered to erase all doubts and to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's condition requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications such as heart failure or systemic embolization.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,98,Patient Representation:  Background: Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  currently unemployed  residing in a suburban area. He's a former smoker with a 20-pack year history but quit smoking 10 years ago. He reports moderate alcohol consumption at social gatherings. He has been involved with intermittent intravenous drug use in his younger years but has been abstinent for the last 30 years.  Past Medical history: The patient has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that is controlled through oral medication. He also suffers from hypertension  for which he takes antihypertensive medication. He underwent dental extraction 2 weeks ago.  Presenting Complaint: He presents with acute onset of symptoms including intermittent fevers  malaise  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss for over a month. He also describes experiencing night sweats for the past two weeks and noticed several small red spots on his palms and soles recently.  Family History: His father passed away from a stroke in his late 40s  and his mother has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has one brother living with cardiovascular disease.  Social History: The patient lives alone and has a small network of friends he meets occasionally. He owns a pet dog. He admits that he isn't physically active  mostly sedentary and eats a typical Western diet.  Literaturally  patients with infective endocarditis generally tend to be older adults  male  with a history of invasive medical procedures or conditions that result in immunosuppression. Risk factors in this population may include hypertension  diabetes  and previous heart conditions. Additionally  social habits such as smoking  drug use  and a high calorie  low nutrient diet are common among this demographic. Dental procedures are a common cause of bacteremia leading to endocarditis in susceptible individuals.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,99,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 64-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for rheumatic heart disease (requiring valve repair)  intravenous drug use  tobacco use  and diabetes mellitus.  Presenting Complaint: The patient has presented to the clinic with complaints of intermittent fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and a new heart murmur noted on physical examination.  Medical Background: The patient had a history of rheumatic heart disease  which led to the need for valve repair around 10 years back. He has been noncompliant with his medications and follow-ups related to this condition. The patient also has a 15-year history of intravenous drug use but claims to have been clean for the past 3 months. Upon inquiry  he reports a 25 pack-year history of smoking but quit about a year ago. His diabetes has been suboptimally managed  indicated by his elevated HbA1c of 8.5% taken six months back.  Family and Social History: He lives alone  is currently unemployed  and states that he is abstinent from alcohol. The patient’s mother was hypertensive  but there's no family history of any rheumatic diseases or malignancies.  Examination: The patient is febrile with a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius. A new systolic murmur is heard on cardiovascular examination. There are small erythematous lesions present on the palms and soles. He is in mild distress due to weakness and the ongoing fever.  Given the above information  the patient displays classic signs and risk factors for developing native-valve infective endocarditis including the pre-existing valve disease  history of rheumatic heart disease  a history of intravenous drug use  and poorly controlled diabetes. His age  gender  and ethnicity align with literature stating that infective endocarditis is more common in older male patients  particularly in those who have structural heart disease or are intravenous drug users. Immediate hospitalization and empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted while waiting for blood cultures  along with consultation from a cardiologist and infectious disease specialist.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,6,100,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 57-year-old white male patient comes to the clinic presenting symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis. He works as a plumber and reports a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He is obese (BMI 30.5) and has a history of smoking  reflecting a pack per day history for the last 30 years. His vices include heavy alcohol consumption  approximated at six to eight standard drinks per day.  Past Medical History: The patient has a diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus which is currently managed through medication and diet with moderate control. He was also diagnosed with hypertension two years ago and is on therapy. There is an additional previous history of periodontal disease and multiple dental extractions which have been treated successfully. No known drug allergies are recorded. Furthermore  he admits he has been non-compliant with his prescribed medication regime due to financial barriers.

Present Illness: Over the past two weeks  he has been experiencing episodes of fever  fatigue  shortness of breath  and weight loss despite maintaining normal eating habits. He also reports night sweats and an erythematous rash on his lower extremities.  The combination of the patient’s symptoms  socioeconomic condition  lifestyle habits  and medical history limits his access to adequate healthcare. This presents a significant challenge in managing his current condition. Early detection and multidisciplinary management plans consisting of robust antibiotic therapy  addressing potential risk factors linked with his lifestyle  and surgical intervention when indicated may improve his prognosis.   Conclusion: This is a typical representation of a patient presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis having certain demographic and risk characteristic trends present in the patient population suffering from this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,1,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient   Introduction:   Infective endocarditis (IE) is a microbial infection of the endothelial surface of the heart  predominantly affecting the heart valves. It's an uncommon but life-threatening disease  often seen in males  elderly  and those with a history of intravenous drug use. Here  we present a case of a 75-year-old male non-drug user patient with native-valve infective endocarditis diagnosed at our teaching hospital.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information:   Mr. X is a 75-year-old African American male from a suburban area  with a body mass index of 27. He is a retired engineer with history of occasional alcohol use and no reported history of tobacco or intravenous drug use. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. X presented to the emergency department complaining of persistent fever  fatigue  and recent onset shortness of breath. He also reported unintended weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the month prior to presentation and several episodes of nocturnal sweats. There was no known history of rheumatic heart disease  recent dental work  or invasive procedures. On examination  he appeared chronically ill. His temperature was 38C  blood pressure was 140/95 mmHg  heart rate was 102 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. He had a systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers with a white blood cell count of 14 000 per microliter and C-reactive protein of 100 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no ST or T wave changes. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Therapeutic Interventions:  The patient was promptly started on intravenous infusion of nafcillin and gentamicin as per American Heart Association guidelines for native-valve Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  His symptoms progressively improved with antibiotic therapy over two weeks. Surgery was not considered due to the absence of heart failure  uncontrolled infection  or uncontrolled sepsis. Repeat cultures were negative  and the course of antibiotics was continued for a total of 6 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography at discharge showed the resolution of the vegetation. He was followed up in the outpatient department and remained asymptomatic with no signs of recurrence after 3 months.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis in elderly with unexplained febrile illness  especially in the setting of valvular abnormalities. Early diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic strategies and aggressive management can significantly improve patient outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,2,Title: A Case Report of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Patient  Patient Information:  A 70-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the Emergency Department with several weeks of fatigue  malaise  and unintentional weight loss. She had no history of intravenous drug use  no known allergies  and no family history of any cardiac diseases. The patient lives with her husband and is a retired teacher.  Clinical Findings:  On general examination  the patient was febrile (38.6°C) and had a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 130/88 mmHg. Her body mass index was 28 kg/m^2  indicating overweight. Auscultation of the heart demonstrated a new murmur over the mitral valve area  suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained which eventually grew Streptococcus parasanguinis  a bacteria commonly associated with oral flora and known to cause infective endocarditis.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed revealing a vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve along with moderate mitral regurgitation. These findings supported the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. No other source of infection was identified. Her body temperature  elevated heart rate  positive blood cultures  and imaging results fulfilled the modified Duke criteria for definite infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin per Infectious Diseases consultation for a planned duration of 6 weeks. Serial blood cultures turned negative after 7 days of therapy reflecting a good initial response to treatment. The patient’s antibiotic regimen was complicated by an acute kidney injury  most likely secondary to the use of gentamicin. The antibiotic was therefore discontinued  and her renal function improved gradually with intravenous fluid hydration.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on day 28 of therapy showed a decrease in the size of the mitral valve vegetation with residual moderate mitral regurgitation. Her condition improved gradually and she was discharged to a transitional care facility with continued intravenous ceftriaxone therapy. A follow-up outpatient visit one month post-therapy completion showed the patient to be doing well clinically with a complete resolution of her symptoms  suggesting successful management of her native-valve infective endocarditis.  Informed Consent:   Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report.  Patient’s Perspective:  The patient expressed relief at the resolution of her symptoms and the management of her condition  showing willingness to follow lifestyle modifications to prevent a recurrence.  Peer-review:   The case report has been peer-reviewed.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,3,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Male with Uncontrolled Diabetes  Introduction: This case report presents a 56-year-old Hispanic male with a history of uncontrolled type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) who presented with symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis. To the best of our knowledge  this is a rare description of native-valve infective endocarditis in a diabetic patient without any known preexisting cardiac conditions.  Case Presentation: A 56-year-old Hispanic male attended the emergency department with a two-week history of intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 lbs in 2 months. He reported a history of poorly-controlled type II DM  for which he was taking Metformin irregularly. He had no prior history of intravenous drug use or any invasive procedures  and his family history was negative for cardiac diseases.  Clinical Findings: On presentation  the patient appeared acutely ill but was hemodynamically stable. Physical examination revealed pallor  mild peripheral edema  and an unexplained new-onset heart murmur. No signs of Osler’s nodes or Janeway lesions were observed.  Investigations: Blood tests revealed leukocytosis  elevated ESR and CRP consistent with an acute inflammatory response  and uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a large mobile vegetation attached to the posterior leaflet of the patient's native mitral valve.  Diagnosis: Integrating the clinical presentation  physical findings  and results from investigations  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Management and Outcome: The patient was placed on empiric antibiotic therapy  with subsequent adjustment according to the sensitivities of the isolated organism. Blood glucose levels were managed with insulin therapy and diet control. Due to the large size of the vegetation and ensuing valvular damage causing moderate to severe regurgitation  the patient underwent surgical removal of the vegetation and mitral valve repair. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on prolonged antibiotic therapy and strict glycemic control. A six-month follow-up showed significant improvement with controlled diabetes and no signs of recurrent endocarditis.  Conclusion: This case highlights the potential for native-valve infective endocarditis in patients with poorly controlled diabetes  despite the absence of traditional predisposing cardiac conditions. Regular follow-ups to ensure adequate glycemic control could be essential in preventing such severe complications in diabetics.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,4,Title: Infective Endocarditis in a Native Valve: A Case Report  Patient Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting from his primary care physician with a recent history of unexplained fatigue  fevers  night sweats  weight loss  and a new heart murmur was admitted to our tertiary care center. The patient reported noticing these symptoms progressively worsening over the past two months.  Past Medical History: From his history  it was revealed that he had previously been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension  which were both well-controlled with metformin and amlodipine respectively. He also had a 45 pack-year smoking history  but had quit about five years prior to this presentation. Prophylactic dentistry was regularly maintained  and he had no known allergies. Additionally  the patient had no history of illicit drug use or prior cardiac disease.  Investigations and Clinical Findings: Surface echocardiography revealed a 3 cm vegetation on the patient's native aortic valve. Blood cultures were taken on admission and grew Streptococcus viridans  confirming a diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. No extracardiac manifestations of infective endocarditis were discovered on computed tomography of the head  chest  abdomen  and pelvis. His renal function and liver tests were found to be within normal ranges.  Treatment: The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics according to local hospital protocol for Streptococcus viridans  which includes penicillin G and gentamicin. Due to the large size of the valve vegetation and the associated compromised cardiac function  surgical intervention through aortic valve replacement was deemed necessary by both the infectious disease team and the cardiovascular surgery team.  Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient recovered well from the valve replacement surgery without any major surgical complications. Antibiotic therapy was continued post-operatively and the patient was discharged on a four-week course of antibiotics  with outpatient follow-up set for two and six weeks post discharge. At re-review  the patient was symptom-free with no evidence of recurrent infection. Further echocardiography showed a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve with no residual vegetation.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the significance of early recognition and effective management of native-valve infective endocarditis  highlighting the combined role of antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention when warranted. It underscores the importance of a thorough clinical assessment in patients with unexplained systemic symptoms and heart murmurs to avoid potential fatal outcomes related to infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,5,Title: A Case Study of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 55-year-old Hispanic Female  Patient Information: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic female  residing in an urban setting in New Mexico. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She works as a school teacher and has no specific occupational hazards. The patient has a body mass index of 28.3 and was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She has not undergone any surgical procedures in her lifetime.  Clinical findings: The patient presented with a fever of 102°F  chills  profuse sweating  and a persistent cough for several weeks. On examination  a new murmur was also detected. Her vitals were stable  except for an elevated heart rate.   Diagnostic assessment: Blood cultures were taken which confirmed the presence of Streptococcus bovis. An echocardiogram presented vegetation on the mitral valve with severe regurgitation  indicating native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was admitted and intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated  including penicillin and gentamicin  in accordance with guidelines for Streptococcus bovis IE. Despite therapeutic intervention  signs of heart failure began to manifest  and surgical intervention was considered. Subsequently  the patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement without any complications.  Follow-up and outcomes: The patient responded well to the surgical intervention and subsequent oral antibiotic regimen over a period of six weeks. Her post-discharge recovery was also satisfactory  with no further signs of IE. Heart failure symptoms have resolved and her ejection fraction improved. She is currently on regular follow-ups and has adhered to her diabetic and hypertensive medications.  Patient’s perspective: The patient reports feeling better with a drastic decrease in her symptoms. She acknowledges the importance of maintaining control over her type 2 diabetes and hypertension to avoid further complications.  Informed consent: The patient gave informed consent for her data to be published in a case report.  Teaching points: Native-valve infective endocarditis remains a severe disease with potential lethal complications  particularly heart failure. Early detection and appropriate management are crucial in improving patient outcomes. Regular follow-ups for high-risk individuals  like the patient with comorbidities in this case (hypertension and diabetes)  are critical to prevent and identify diseases in early stages. The student should learn to evaluate patients with persistent fever and consider IE in differential diagnosis  especially when a new murmur is detected. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,6,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male  Introduction: This case report presents a middle-aged Caucasian male with complex presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Case Presentation: Mr. AH  a 52 year-old Caucasian male insurance agent  residing in Chicago  Illinois  presented to the emergency department with recurrent fever  extreme fatigue  weight loss  and progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past two months. He denied any history of drug abuse  travel  pets at home  dental procedure  or recent surgery.  Past Medical History: The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. He does not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. There is no family history of heart disease or similar symptoms.   Clinical Examination: On admission  Mr. AH was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  heart rate of 98 beats/min  and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min. Cardiac examination revealed a grade III/VI mid-systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Lung auscultation was normal  and there were no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis observed.  Investigations: His blood examination showed elevated leukocyte count and C-reactive protein. His renal function and liver functions were within normal limits. Blood cultures were drawn and sent for analysis. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a mobile echodensity on the anterior mitral leaflet  suggestive of vegetation with moderate mitral regurgitation. Chest radiograph was unremarkable.  Management and Outcome: He was started empirically on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics  which included Vancomycin and Gentamicin. Once blood culture results confirmed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) as the causative organism  Vancomycin was discontinued  and the patient was continued on high-dose intravenous penicillin G and Gentamicin.  The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over the next few days and he was afebrile by the fifth day of hospitalization. His fatigue and shortness of breath also improved significantly.    After a course of intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks  a follow-up Transthoracic Echocardiography showed a significant reduction in vegetation size  and his clinical symptoms were completely resolved.   Conclusion: This case illustrates the complexity of diagnosing native-valve infective endocarditis. The prompt recognition of the key symptoms  the systematic approach to investigation  and the early initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy were vital in providing effective treatment for Mr. AH.

This case underscores the importance for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for endocarditis in high risk individuals who present with persistent fever  heart murmurs  and systemic signs of infection. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,8,Title: Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Male with History of Valvular Heart Disease: A Case Report  Abstract:  This case report represents a 55-year-old Caucasian male with a history of Degenerative Heart Valve Disease  who was diagnosed and managed for Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).  Case Presentation:  A 55-year-old Caucasian male  accountant by profession  non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer  presented to the hospital with a two-week history of low-grade fever  chills  general fatigue  weight loss  and a recent onset of intermittent chest discomfort. He had a noted past medical history of Degenerative Heart Valve Disease diagnosed five years prior. However  he never underwent any surgical intervention required for his existing heart condition  citing his fear of surgery and the perceived desire to manage the disease conservatively.   Clinical Findings and Diagnosis:  On examination  he was found to have a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur. Blood tests illustrated an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP). Three sets of blood cultures were obtained which  after 48 hours  identified Staphylococcus aureus as the infecting organism. A Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a 1.1 cm mobile vegetation on the ventricular side of the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis as per the Modified Duke's Criteria.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was started on empirical antibiotic therapy with Cefazolin and Gentamicin per American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines  which was continued for 6 weeks followed by a two-week course of Cloxacillin as per the sensitivities of the blood culture findings. The patient’s clinical conditions  including fever and symptoms  started to improve after a week of antibiotic treatment. The patient declined surgical treatment. After completion of antibiotic therapy  a follow-up TTE exhibited significant decrease in the size of the vegetation. The patient was subsequently discharged with instructions for rigorous dental hygiene to prevent future recurrence and was scheduled for routine follow-ups.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of appropriate timely diagnosis and management of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  particularly in patients with pre-existing valvular heart disease. Additionally  it emphasizes the patient's role in therapeutic decisions and the necessity of regular follow-up evaluations to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,9,Title: A Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient  Introduction  This report represents a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). This case study emphasizes the importance of early and accurate diagnosis  followed by appropriate management  in improving the prognosis of IE.  Case Description  Mr. X  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented with complaints of recurrent low-grade fever  generalized fatigue  and shortness of breath for approximately four weeks. The patient has a known history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both well-controlled on medications. Smoking history was noted with the patient reported being a former smoker  quitting smoking approximately 20 years back. He lives alone and he is mostly independent with his activities of daily living  but had recently found these tasks increasingly challenging due to his ongoing symptoms.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared to be malnourished and mildly dehydrated. Notable findings included pallor  low-grade fever (100.4F)  and a new onset  grade II pansystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. No other immediate clinical abnormalities were detected.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  The pansystolic murmur identified upon examination alarmed physicians to a potential heart condition  and subsequent investigations were targeted at diagnosis and assessment of potential cardiac involvements. The patient's lab results showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  signifying an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. His blood cultures were dispatched which later confirmed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus  highly suggestive of a bacterial endocarditis.  A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a thickened mitral valve with a mobile echodensity suggestive of vegetation attached to the leaflet  dramatically affirming the suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment  The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics as per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Given the identification of sizable vegetation  alongside the patient's deteriorating clinical condition  a multidisciplinary team concluded that surgical intervention for his infected valve would offer the best chance of recovery. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement surgery two weeks following initial diagnosis  with a smooth postoperative period.  Conclusion  This case illustrates the importance of clinical suspicion for IE in patients presenting with non-specific clinical pictures  especially in those with predisposing health conditions  like diabetes mellitus. Prompt initiation of investigations  correct diagnosis  and appropriate management are pivotal in treating IE effectively  thereby improving patient prognosis and quality of life. The role of interdisciplinary management is also underlined in ensuring comprehensive care for patients with IE.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,10,Title: A Rare Presentation of Streptococcus viridans Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 56-year-old African American Male  Patient Information: A 56-year-old African American Male  married  currently working as an office clerk  came to the medical outpatient department complaining primarily of the following conditions: fluctuating fever for 1 month  weakness  weight loss  night sweats  a new murmur (heard during auscultation)  and shortness of breath on exertion. The patient's family history revealed that his father died due to coronary artery disease while his mother had diabetes and hypertension. He reported smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years but denied any alcohol intake or illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient was tachycardic but stable. Further symptoms included splinter hemorrhages under the nails  Janeway lesions  and Osler’s nodes on his palms. A systolic murmur was noticed at the cardiac apex. Blood pressure was recorded at 130/90 mmHg  heart rate at 85 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and temperature at 100.5F. The rest of the physical examination didn't reveal any other significant finding.  Diagnostic Assessment: Two sets of blood cultures were drawn from different sites  both of which grew alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed vegetations on mitral valve with moderate regurgitation but no abscess or perforation. These findings aligned with the Modified Duke Criteria and led to the diagnosis of Definite Infective Endocarditis.  The patient's CBC showed mild anemia and leukocytosis. Kidney function tests  liver function tests  and electrolytes were within normal limits. An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient had been started on Empiric IV antibiotic therapy (Vancomycin and Gentamicin) while waiting for the blood culture result. Given the culture sensitivity report  the antibiotics were deescalated to IV Penicillin G and Gentamicin.   The patient's condition improved over the next few days  as indicated by a decrease in fever and reduced severity of breathlessness. A follow-up TTE after two weeks of therapy showed a size reduction in vegetation.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient completed a 4-week course of antibiotics. His symptoms improved significantly  and repeat blood cultures remained negative. He was advised to quit smoking and was given appropriate counseling. A regular follow-up monthly plan was arranged to monitor the patient's clinical and echocardiographic progress.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed his gratitude and satisfaction with the outcome of his treatment after his discharge. He also affirmed his intention to heed his physician’s advice concerning smoking cessation and maintaining regular follow-up visits.  Informed Consent: Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,11,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 55-Year-Old African-American Male  Introduction: We present the case of a 55-year-old African-American male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Studies show a slightly higher incidence of infective endocarditis among African-American populations  with males manifesting more severe symptoms.  Case Description:  A 55-year-old African-American male  working as a construction worker  presented with a two-week history of fatigue  fever  night sweats  and atypical chest pain. The patient had a history of intravenous (IV) drug use in his 20s but had remained sober for over 25 years. He had a known history of hypertension  for which he was taking hydrochlorothiazide  and a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed through oral hypoglycemic agents.  On examination  the patient appeared ill and had a low-grade fever. He presented with rashes consistent with Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  as well as Janeway lesions in his palms and soles. Cardiac examination revealed a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation.   Investigations:  Laboratory investigations revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl and elevated inflammatory markers with a C-reactive protein of 93 mg/L. Prolonged blood cultures (3 sets) were positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  Transthoracic echocardiogram showed large vegetations on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. The remaining valves appeared normal. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of left-sided  native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) according to infective endocarditis treatment guidelines. Despite medical treatment  the patient remained symptomatic with persistently positive blood cultures after one week. It was decided to proceed with surgical intervention considering the large vegetations  severe valve damage  and persistent bacteremia.   The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement surgery and continued on postoperative antibiotics for six weeks.   Discussion:  This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing infective endocarditis  that may occur even in patients without recent IV drug use. It additionally highlights the role of surgical intervention when medical therapy alone fails.   Conclusion:  Despite being a relatively rare condition  early recognition of infective endocarditis symptoms  especially in at-risk populations  is essential in managing this potential life-threatening condition. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when faced with suggestive clinical features and should promptly initiate appropriate antibiotics and necessary intervention as required.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,12,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report  Patient Profile: A 50-year-old Hispanic male  resident of New York City  working as a school bus driver with no known travel history outside the United States.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented in the Emergency Department reporting a 2-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  malaise  and a weight loss of 10 pounds. He also complained of persistent fatigue and mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The patient had a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet. He had been diagnosed with hypertension five years ago and was taking antihypertensive medication. There were no previous hospitalizations  surgery or allergies reported. The patient quit smoking twelve years ago  and denied illicit drug use  but admitted to drinking alcohol socially.  Clinical Examination: On examination  the patient looked moderately ill  with a low-grade fever of 100.5°F. A systolic murmur was detected over the left lower sternal border. The rest of the physical examination  including a detailed neurological examination  was unremarkable.  Lab Tests and Imaging: Several blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Complete blood count showed anemia and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were significantly elevated. A transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a vegetation on the mitral valve  with moderate mitral regurgitation. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered and it did not reveal any abscesses.  Infective endocarditis was diagnosed based on the Duke Criteria with 2 major criteria (positive blood cultures and echocardiographic findings of vegetation) satisfied.  Case Management and Outcome: The patient was promptly initiated on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and gentamicin  tailored down to penicillin monotherapy based on antibiotic susceptibility results. After 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment  he showed significant clinical improvement with resolution of fever  normalization of inflammatory markers  and weight stabilization. Repeat blood cultures were negative  and the patient was subsequently discharged home on strict follow-up with infectious diseases and cardiology clinics.  Conclusion: The early diagnosis and prompt  appropriate management of this case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with clinical features of prolonged unexplained fever  cardiac murmur  and markers of systemic inflammation  even in the absence of any history of intravenous drug use or structural heart disease. This report adds to the literature highlighting native-valve infective endocarditis in middle-aged individuals with underlying non-cardiac comorbidities.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,13,Title: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 65-Year-Old Male: A Case Report   Introduction:  This case report describes a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient who presented with native valve infective endocarditis.  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old retiree living in Birmingham  Alabama with his wife. He is a former construction worker with a 45-pack-year smoking history and had quit smoking ten years prior. His past medical history included hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Clinical Findings:  The patient first came to the medical attention complaining of generalized malaise  fever  and unintentional weight loss of around 5 kg over a period of one month. He reported subjective fevers and noted increasing shortness of breath over this period.  Diagnostic Assessment:  His vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg  heart rate of 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with increased use of accessory muscles  and an elevated temperature of 38.7°C. Physical examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the apex of the heart and punctate  erythematous skin lesions over the palms and soles.  The blood work showed an increased white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance  mild anemia  and elevated inflammatory markers. His chest radiograph showed a normal cardiothoracic ratio  clear lung fields  and normal hilar shadows . Echocardiography showed vegetations on the mitral valve along with severe mitral regurgitation  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  The patient was started on empiric therapy with intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamicin  and blood cultures subsequently grew Streptococcus viridans  underlying the need for continuation of the same antibiotics.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient continued antibiotic therapy for six weeks. The physicians suggested a surgical consultation considering severe mitral regurgitation and persistent heart failure symptoms  despite medical therapy. However  the patient decided against surgery.  Follow-ups and Outcomes:  During the follow-up period  the patient's symptoms improved modestly  suggesting partial resolution of the infection. Unfortunately  he continues to suffer from exertional dyspnea due to severe mitral regurgitation  requiring periodic hospital readmissions for heart failure exacerbation.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the significant morbidity associated with native valve infective endocarditis  especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. It underlines the critical need for early detection  appropriate antibiotic therapy  and vigilant follow-up care in the management of this life-threatened condition.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,15,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction  Infective endocarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Native-valve infective endocarditis  which affects the heart's natural valves  is particularly significant in older adults with underlying heart diseases. This case report presents a 73-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).  Patient Information  Mr. A is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  a retired teacher residing in Minnesota  USA. The patient was generally healthy aside from a known medical history of Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease (HCVD)  and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM-2). His family history had a significant pattern of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  with his father having died from myocardial infarction. He is a non-smoker  occasional consumes alcohol  and had no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings  The patient presented at the emergency department with a week-long history of low-grade fever  malaise  weight loss  and night sweats. Newly onset of cardiac murmur was detected during a physical examination. He also complained of arthralgias  more prominent over the right knee and ankle. Routine blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count  C-reactive protein  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment   After initial suspicion  diagnosis of NVIE was confirmed by Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing vegetations on the mitral valve and moderate mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans  a common causative organism of NVIE. Diagnosis was satisfying the Duke criteria and further supported by the combination of persistent bacteremia  echocardiographic findings  and clinical symptoms.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was started on empirical intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin) which was later de-escalated to ceftriaxone and gentamicin after getting the blood culture results  in accordance with the American Heart Association guidelines for NVIE. Glycemic control was optimized with insulin to minimize the effects of DM-2.  Follow-up and Outcomes  The patient responded well to the antibiotic regimen. After a four-week course  his inflammatory markers normalized  and symptoms subsided. A follow-up echocardiography showed a decrease in the size of the vegetations and reduced mitral regurgitation. Although he remains at risk for potential complications such as heart failure  stroke  or systemic embolization  Mr. A was deemed stable for discharge with recommendations for close follow-up.  Patient Perspective  Mr. A reported significant improvement in his health status after the treatment. He voiced a strong commitment to maintaining his treatment regimen  regular follow-up visits  and monitoring his health condition to minimize the risk of recurrence or complications.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of early detection and aggressive medical management of NVIE  especially in elderly patients with underlying cardiac disease. Comprehensive care including diligent antibiotic administration  strict glycemic control  and patient education were key to the successful outcomes in this case. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,16,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information:  Mr. L is a 62-year-old Caucasian male from a rural community who presented with a four-week history of fatigue  weight loss  intermittent fever and chills. Prior to this  he enjoyed an active lifestyle and worked full time in agriculture.  Past Medical History:  Mr. L is a known diabetic  with his blood glucose levels well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents. He has been monitored for mild hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  but has had no previous hospital admissions. He does not smoke  reports moderate alcohol consumption and has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. L appeared chronically unwell and was febrile (38.7°C.). He displayed symptoms of heart failure including increased jugular venous pressure  a pansystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal edge  bilateral basal crackles on chest auscultation  and pitting lower limb edema. Spleen size was normal on abdominal examination. There were no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. Blood pressure was 150/85 mmHg  heart rate 90 bpm  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Blood investigations showed a raised white cell count of 12 x 109/L (normal 4-11 x 109/L)  an elevated C-reactive protein of 100 mg/L (< 5 mg/L) and slightly elevated creatinine levels. A chest radiograph showed signs of pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy and sinus tachycardia. A transthoracic echocardiogram  followed by a confirmatory transesophageal echocardiogram  illustrated severe mitral regurgitation with a large vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. A positive blood culture identified Streptococcus bovis as the infectious agent.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  Mr. L was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous antibiotics (Penicillin G and Gentamicin) following the antibiotic susceptibility testing. His condition showed improvement with antibiotics. However due to the size of the vegetation and severe mitral regurgitation  surgical intervention became necessary. He underwent successful mitral valve replacement and was discharged on long-term oral antibiotics  anticoagulation  and advised on strict blood sugar and pressure control.  Follow up:  At follow up one month later  Mr. L reported improved symptomatically and his blood cultures showed no growth. However  due to the association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with colorectal neoplasia  an additional colonoscopy was scheduled. A small adenoma was identified at sigmoid colon and successfully removed.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis  especially with persistent nonspecific symptoms. The case also shows the importance of following the complete treatment paradigm of native-valve endocarditis - including diagnosis  appropriate use of antibiotic therapy  consideration of surgical intervention  and investigation of possible associated conditions.    This case conforms with the typical demographic of infective endocarditis patients who are often middle-aged to older men with pre-existing heart conditions or those with comorbid conditions such as diabetes. Future case reports could analyze whether there is a growing trend toward increased disease incidence in individuals from rural areas. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,17,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in Elderly Patient with Diabetes Mellitus Type II: A Case Study  INTRODUCTION: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe  life-threatening condition  particularly in the elderly  caused by the infection of the heart valves by microorganisms. Native valve infective endocarditis occurs in individuals without a history of prosthetic heart valve replacement. This will present a case of an elderly male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II  who developed native-valve infective endocarditis.  CASE PRESENTATION:  Patient Information: Mr. JH is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a one-week history of progressively increasing fatigue  intermittent fever  and shortness of breath. He also reported an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds in the last month.   Medical history: Mr. JH has a long-standing history of diabetes mellitus (DM) type II for over 25 years which has been complicated by peripheral neuropathy but well-controlled with Metformin. He also has hypertension controlled with Lisinopril. He had a history of arteriovenous fistula repair two years ago and a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. He is a former smoker  with 20-pack-year history and quit smoking five years ago.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  he had a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F)  blood pressure of 150/85mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed the presence of a new murmur  specifically a systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Slight splenomegaly was palpable on abdominal exam  and pitting edema was present in both lower extremities  more prominent on the right.  Diagnostic Assessment: The laboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 12.6 x 10^3/uL  hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL  and platelet count of 490 x 10^3/uL. ESR was 65 mm/hr  and C-reactive protein levels were elevated. Blood glucose was slightly elevated at 155mg/dL. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Mr. JH underwent a TTE  followed by a TOE which demonstrated vegetation on the mitral valve and severe mitral valve regurgitation confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. JH was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone  which was later adjusted based on the results of blood culture sensitivities. His clinical status started improving over the next few days with a decrease in fever and resolution of his symptoms. His shortness of breath was managed with diuretics.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Despite initial improvement  after two weeks of therapy  his symptoms started to worsen. Repeat TTE suggested progressive valve destruction. Consequently  a decision was made for surgical intervention and a mitral valve replacement was performed successfully. Post-operation  the patient underwent an extended course of intravenous antibiotics and cardiac rehabilitation. He showed resolution of symptoms and an improved quality of life in the subsequent follow-ups.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,18,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Patient Information:  This report discusses the case of an 80-year-old Caucasian male admitted to the cardiology department of our medical center. The patient lives in a suburban setting and lives alone  with most of his support provided by his children. He is retired and has a past part-time history of breeding cattle.  Presenting Complaint: The patient complained of progressive fatigue  intermittent fever  weight loss  and night sweats occurring over the last 6 weeks. He also reported experiencing mild chest discomfort with increasing frequency.   Previous Medical History: The patient is known to have a 20-year history of well-controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago. He had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction 15 years ago and was placed on a medication regimen of low-dose aspirin  a beta-blocker  and a statin that he has continued since. No history of intravenous drug use  dental procedures  or recent surgical interventions was reported. The patient had a bout of pneumonia 2 years ago that required hospitalization but recovered well without complications.  Investigational Findings and Diagnosis: Physical examination revealed mild pallor and a new-onset systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Blood tests showed a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level  mild normocytic anemia  and leukocytosis. His blood glucose levels and other vital signs were within typically managed ranges. Serial blood culture sets grew Streptococcus bovis  indicative of bacteremia.   Echocardiography showed thickening and vegetation of the aortic valve  with moderate aortic regurgitation. No ventricular wall motion abnormalities were detected. These findings led to a diagnosis of definite infective endocarditis  based on the modified Duke criteria.   Treatment and Progress:  The patient was started on high-dose penicillin  initially administered intravenously  following the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. After showing good clinical response  he was switched to oral medication. The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over the next 2 weeks.  The presence of S. Bovis led to further investigation  including total colonoscopy  which revealed an early stage of colon carcinoma. The Mass General Brigham Department for Primary Care took over and set up a predilection for routine checks and continuous monitoring.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of native-valve infective endocarditis  and the need to investigate for a possible gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with S. Bovis bacteremia. Active involvement of the primary healthcare team in follow-up and medication compliance is paramount in managing such cases. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,19,Title: A Case Report of a 65-year-old Male Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male belonging to the low socio-economic group and hailing from an urban area in the Midwest of the United States of America. He has no prior history of illicit drug use or alcohol addiction. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife; they have four adult children.   Past medical history: The patient has a significant medical history  including type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years that is controlled with Metformin and insulin therapy  and hypertension for around ten years under management with Losartan. He had an ischemic stroke five years ago with satisfactory recovery and maintains a regimen of aspirin and statins. Routine blood work in the past has remained within normal limits. Recent review of systems was positive for dyspnea on exertion and weight loss  which was attributed to an aging process by his primary care physician. Though the patient reported occasional swollen and tender joints on his hands and feet  no diagnosed inflammatory or rheumatic diseases were found in his medical records.   Presenting complaints: The patient came to the emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath and increasing fatigue over the past two weeks. The symptoms were worsening progressively  and he started noticing swelling in both lower limbs  high-grade intermittent fever  and unintentional weight loss. There were no complaints of cough  chest pain  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Diagnostic assessment: His clinical and lab reports suggested congestive heart failure and were suspected for infective endocarditis. His peripheral white blood cell count was significantly high  demonstrating left shift. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus species. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an echogenic mass on the aortic valve  indicating vegetations  with valve regurgitation and mild left ventricular dysfunction. Findings were consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment: The patient was hospitalized immediately  and an appropriate antibiotics regimen was started based on the sensitivity tests of the blood cultures. The patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and Gentamycin. The patient's heart condition showed improvement and plans for valve replacement were deferred.  Outcome: Post-hospital stay  the patient responded well to the given antibiotics. His inflammatory markers improved  and heart failure symptoms resolved significantly after a two-month protocol as an outpatient.  In conclusion  this case enlightens the importance of considering infective endocarditis in older adults presenting with symptoms of heart failure  especially in those with pre-existing heart conditions. Regular follow-ups and meticulous care are necessitated in such patients to prevent the recurrence and complications of the condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,20,Title: The Role of Early Diagnosis in Improving Future Prognosis of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infective disease of the endocardium. If left untreated  it can lead to severe complications and may even be fatal. The severity of IE requires healthcare providers to be extremely vigilant and familiar with its possible symptoms.  Demographic Information: The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female  called J.P.  a retired secretary  living in the Midwest of the United States with her husband  referred to our hospital on Mar 2  2020. She has been habitual of smoking since she was a teenager but quit about five years ago. She has no history of alcohol or substance abuse.   Past Medical History: The patient has a previous diagnosis of hypertension (since the age of 48) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (since the age of 57). These conditions are being managed with the use of metoprolol and metformin  respectively  from the past seven years. She has an intact familial history with no specific hereditary diseases reported. J.P. also underwent menopause at the age of 50. She has no allergy towards antibiotics or other medications.  Presenting Complaint and Diagnosis: The patient reported a three-week history of progressive fatigue  mild fever  and a recent loss of appetite. Physical exam revealed a heart murmur and splinter haemorrhages under the nails. Blood cultures were taken  which ruled out sepsis but grew Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiography showed vegetations on the mitral valve  highly suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital and immediately initiated on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin therapy for the aggressive management of IE. J.P. responded optimistically to the treatment by displaying signs of improvement such as reduced fatigue and the gradual return of a healthy appetite seven days after the initial administration.  Discussion: Native-valve endocarditis mostly inflicts elderly people with pre-existing cardiac conditions. This case illustrates the necessity of suspicion  prompt diagnosis  and appropriate treatment of IE  especially in patients with existing cardiovascular diseases.  Moreover  this case implicates the need for patient education on the importance of routine health check-ups to ensure early detection of any potential health issues and create a better prognosis for complications of chronic conditions.  Conclusion: This case report serves as a reminder of an increasingly recognized causative organism of native-valve endocarditis – Streptococcus viridans. It emphasizes the need for active health assessment in the elderly population  particularly those with cardiovascular disease comorbidity  to allow the early diagnosis and treatment and prevent severe complications of IE.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,21,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male with a History of Intravenous Drug Use  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a significant pathological infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Among those at risk are individuals with pre-existing heart disease  or those who engage in high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use. This case report explores an episode of native-valve IE in a middle-aged  Caucasian male with a documented history of opioid addiction.  Case Presentation:  A 54-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department presenting with fever  malaise  night sweats  and a newly developed murmur. Over a period of two weeks prior to admission  he had noticed increasing fatigue  weight loss  and intermittent fever. He had a history of heroin addiction and reported recent intravenous drug use. His past medical history was otherwise non-contributory  with no prior episodes of IE  other cardiac anomalies  diabetes  nor immunodeficiency. His family history revealed no instances of cardiac disease or conditions predisposing to IE.  On examination  the patient was febrile (38.7 degrees Celsius) with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute. A new-onset grade 3/6 diastolic murmur was noted on auscultation. Osler's nodes and Janeway lesions were absent. The initial blood analysis revealed elevated inflammation markers; C-reactive protein levels were at 90 mg/L and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 48 mm/hour. Other significant findings included a white blood cell count of 12 000 cells/mm3 (neutrophil predominance) and mildly elevated liver enzymes.  Three sets of blood cultures were drawn over a 24-hour period  all of which grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetations on the tricuspid valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis  showing large (15mm) mobile vegetations on his tricuspid valve  with moderate regurgitation but no abscess or signs of perforation.  The patient was diagnosed with native-valve IE due to MSSA  likely secondary to his intravenous drug use. He was started on intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin according to Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for MSSA endocarditis. Due to the size of his tricuspid valve vegetations and moderate regurgitation  the case was discussed with cardiovascular surgery for possible valve repair or replacement.  Discussion:  This case describes a classic presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient with a major risk factor– intravenous drug use. Success in treating such cases involves early identification through careful clinical assessment  including a thorough history and physical exam  followed by confirmatory blood cultures and echocardiogram. Prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is critical  and surgical intervention is required in certain cases. This case serves as an important reminder for clinicians to consider IE in patients with a history of injection drug use who present with consistent symptoms.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,22,Title: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Male  Introduction  Infective endocarditis is a potentially fatal heart infection affecting the endocardial surface of the heart that can have serious systemic implications if not treated timely. This report outlines the case study of a middle-aged Hispanic patient with native-valve and no history of heart disease  infective endocarditis.  Patient Information and Clinical Findings  The patient was a 58-year-old Hispanic male  a resident of San Antonio  Texas. He was brought to the emergency department with a 3-week history of fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and shortness of breath. Professionally  he worked as a construction worker. He denied any history of intravenous drug use  alcoholism  or connections to people with severe illnesses. His medical history revealed that he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus about 5 years ago but has been uncontrolled due to non-adherence to medication and irregular follow-ups. He was also found to be smoker with a history of twenty pack-years.  On physical examination  his vital signs were found to be unstable with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. He also had a fever of 38.6°C. The oral cavity examination showed poor dental hygiene with several overt carious lesions. Auscultation of his chest revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic region.  Diagnostic Assessment  Blood cultures taken from the patient turned out positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed vegetation on the patient’s native aortic valve  supporting a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was initiated on empirical antibiotic therapy with IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone as well as necessary supportive treatment. The fever subsided after the first two days of the antibiotic therapy and the patient reported an improvement in his fatigue and shortness of breath.  Follow-Up and Outcomes  After a 6-week course of tailored antibiotic therapy  follow-up blood tests showed no evidence of bacteremia  and a repeat echocardiogram showed a marked reduction in the size of the aortic valve vegetation. The patient was discharged with instructions to complete a two week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. As part of the regular follow-up  his diabetic status was also reassessed and is being managed for better outcomes.  Patient Perspective  The patient confessed he had neglected his own health due to work pressures  and the diagnosis was a wake-up call to prioritize his wellbeing. He pledged commitment to regular medical check-ups and an improved lifestyle.  Learning Points  This case highlights the importance of comprehensive medical history and examination in diagnosis  particularly with respect to conditions like infective endocarditis that may not initially present with typical symptoms. It also underscores the need for regular health checks in patients with conditions like diabetes  which can make them more susceptible to infections. It serves to remind us that comprehensive dental care is an integral part of overall health and well-being.

Conclusion: This case highlights that early detection and management of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE) is crucial. While antibiotic therapy forms the cornerstone of therapy  certain clinical situations may mandate surgical intervention as seen in this case. This case further underlines the significance of comprehensive care and close monitoring in patients with IE to prevent and appropriately manage potential complications such as systemic embolization. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,29,Title: A Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an 60 Year Old Male Patient  I. Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a critical cardiovascular disease characterized by infection and inflammation of the inner membrane that lines the heart chambers and the heart valves. Despite advancements in diagnostic imaging  surgical interventions  and antibiotic treatment  NVIE remains a significant health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates.  II. Patient Information   The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  residing in a rural area of Alabama  USA. He works as a craftsman. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. The patient has no known drug allergies.  III. Chief Complaint  The patient presented with symptoms of fever  malaise  and undocumented weight loss over a period of two months.  IV. Past Medical History   The patient had a medical history of type 2 diabetes for five years  controlled with metformin. There were no previous cardiovascular diseases  surgeries  or hospitalizations. He has a known history of occasional recreational drug use (opioids) during his early life (30 years before)  but had not done so recently  as per his report. Immunizations were up to date  and there was no history of recent dental procedures.  V. Clinical Findings   On physical examination  the patient appeared acutely ill with a fever of 38.5°C. He had pale conjunctiva and a few scattered petechiae on the lower extremities. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  VI. Diagnostic Assessment   Blood culture samples revealed the growth of Streptococcus viridans  a common bacterium responsible for NVIE. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was conducted which revealed the presence of valvular vegetations  confirming the diagnosis.   VII. Therapeutic Intervention   The patient was immediately initiated on intravenous antibiotics therapy  specifically a 6-week course of Penicillin G and Gentamicin. Due to valvular defects identified on the TTE  the patient was referred for valve repair surgery.  VIII. Follow-up and Outcomes   The patient responded well to the antibiotics therapy as evidenced by defervescence of fever within a week and clearance of bacteremia within two weeks. Post-surgical recovery was also uneventful.  IX. Takeaway lessons   This case highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion for NVIE in older patients with unexplained fevers especially with a history of mild recreational drug use. The diagnosis can be challenging due to nonspecific clinical presentations and requires prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy to decrease morbidity and mortality.

Three separate sets of blood cultures were taken  all of which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis of Staphylococcus native-valve infective endocarditis was confirmed through Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing large vegetation on the tricuspid valve. The patient tested negative for HIV.  Therapy:  The patient was started on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. Following susceptibility testing  the patient was switched to flucloxacillin. He remained afebrile with improvement in his murmur and general health. Cardiac surgery was not performed due to the significant reduction of the vegetation size and the patient's clinical recovery with medical therapy.  Outcome:  After six weeks of treatment  the patient was discharged in stable condition with outpatient cardiology and infectious disease follow-ups planned.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of recognizing infective endocarditis in patients with a history of intravenous drug use. Early diagnosis and aggressive antibiotic therapy are crucial for favorable outcomes. These individuals require thorough assessment considering their potential risk factors and need for extensive social support to ensure continuity of care.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,33,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner surface of the heart  most frequently the heart valves  caused by bacteria or fungi. Native-valve infective endocarditis occurs in normal  natural heart valves  with Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species being the most common pathogens. This report describes a case of native-valve infective endocarditis in an elderly female patient  which highlights the need for early diagnosis and management.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information:   A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the hospital with a 3-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and loss of appetite. She also reported a recent history of unintentional weight loss. She lives independently and has a 50-year history of tobacco use  though she quit smoking ten years ago.  Medical History:   The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation  which she has managed with oral anticoagulation (Warfarin) and an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitor (Lisinopril). Additionally  she was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years prior  and she has been managing it with a statin (Atorvastatin). She has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a low-grade fever (100.4°F)  and regular heart rate and rhythm with a grade II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the apex. No peripheral stigmata of endocarditis like Osler's nodes  Janeway's lesions  Roth's spots or splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds were observed. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The patient’s blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile 10mm x 5mm mass on the atrial surface of mitral valve  consistent with a vegetation. The chest X-ray did not show any signs of pulmonary infection or congestive heart failure.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on intravenous Penicillin G for 4 weeks combined with Gentamicin for the first two weeks. Anticoagulation was temporarily held due to the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage given the large vegetation.  Follow-Up:  At the one month follow-up  she reported feeling significantly better with resolution of fever and no further weight loss. A repeat TTE showed a significant reduction in vegetation size to 3mm x 2mm without evidence of valvular insufficiency. She was instructed to continue follow-ups every 3 months to monitor her condition.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in elderly patients presenting with non-specific symptoms like fever and weight loss  especially with the presence of predisposing factors like atrial fibrillation and a history of heart valve disease.  Conclusion:  Early diagnosis and appropriate management of native-valve infective endocarditis is crucial in preventing complications like stroke  heart failure  or systemic embolisms  especially in elderly patients who are often more susceptible to such complications. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,34,Title: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Caucasian Male with a History of Intravenous Drug Use: A Case Report  Background: Native valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  typically affecting individuals with pre-existing heart disorders or those with a history of intravenous drug use. Despite both surgical and medical improvements  IE continues to have high morbidity and mortality rates.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the hospital with a two-week history of unexplained fever  malaise  and weight loss. He had a past medical history significant for chronic hepatitis C infection secondary to intravenous drug use  which he quit over 30 years ago. At that time  he had a workup done which suggested mildly regurgitant mitral and tricuspid valves but no definitive diagnosis was made.  On physical examination  the patient appeared lethargic and feverish with a temperature of 38.5°C. Auscultation revealed a new grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Upon careful inspection  Janeway lesions on the palmar surfaces of the hands were noted  along with Osler’s nodes on the finger pads. Given his symptoms  signs  and history  there was a high suspicion for infective endocarditis.  Initial lab work revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein level. Three blood cultures  taken 12 hours apart  grew Streptococcus viridans. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a large vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  consistent with the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  The patient was started on IV antibiotics as per local guidelines  including ampicillin and gentamicin. Despite initial mild improvement in his symptoms  he eventually developed acute heart failure secondary to worsening mitral regurgitation. Cardiac surgery consultants agreed upon mitral valve repair as the most suitable intervention.  The patient underwent successful mitral valve repair and continued on intravenous antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks. He was discharged on lifelong prophylactic oral antibiotics due to his risk factors. At the 3-month and 6-month follow-up  the patient was asymptomatic with a well-functioning mitral valve on echocardiogram. He was counseled extensively on the risks of recurrent IE and was enrolled in a substance misuse programme as a precaution.  Conclusion: This case highlights the intricacies of diagnosing and managing infective endocarditis in patients with a history of intravenous drug misuse. The association between IE and intravenous drug use is well-documented  though it must be noted that this patient's history of misuse was over 30 years in the past. Medical providers must maintain a high index of suspicion for endocarditis in patients with 'distant' drug misuse history especially when presenting with nondescript symptoms such as fever  malaise  and weight loss. Prompt diagnosis and swift initiation of antibiotics can improve morbidity and mortality significantly. It also underscores the importance of continued preventive measures in such a high-risk population.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,38,Title: Infective Endocarditis in a Native Valve of an Elderly Male with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Case Report  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infectious disease that affects the endocardium of the heart and can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly. Herein  we report a case of an elderly male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was diagnosed with infective endocarditis of a native valve.  Case Presentation:  Demographics: Mr. A  a 75-year-old Caucasian male from an urban community  was admitted to our hospital with complaints of persistent high fever  fatigue  and weight loss which had worsened over the last three weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient had a 10-year history of stage 3 CKD  supposed to have resulted from hypertensive nephrosclerosis. He was on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statin therapy. There was no history of illicit drug use  major surgeries  dental procedures  or relevant family illness.  Results/Investigations: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 101 °F. A new murmur was audible in the mitral area. Laboratory tests showed significant leukocytosis  decreased hemoglobin levels  elevated C-reactive protein  and elevated creatinine levels  aligning with his CKD status.  Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed due to the new murmur  persistent fever  and other signs of infection  which showed multiple vegetations on the mitral valve  leading to a preliminary diagnosis of endocarditis. The diagnosis was confirmed by blood cultures which grew Staphylococcus aureus.  Management and Follow-up: After the diagnosis  the patient was immediately started on targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy. Due to the presence of multiple vegetations and the patient's deteriorating condition despite antibiotic therapy  the care team decided that the patient should undergo surgery. He had a successful mitral valve replacement and was continued on antibiotics postoperatively for a total of six weeks.  Discussion:  The present case highlights the importance of considering infective endocarditis in elderly patients having immuno-compromise due to a chronic illness  such as CKD  presenting with unexplained fever and cardiac murmurs. The case also brings attention to the good prognosis following early diagnosis  appropriate antibiotics  and surgical intervention in patients with native-valve infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,39,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 57-Year-Old Caucasian Male  Introduction:  This case report presents a patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). We are highlighting this case in light of the risk factors that tend to precipitate the condition  its clinical course  and outcome after treatment. This is to increase awareness about the criticality of early diagnosis and management of NVIE to improve patient outcomes.  Case Presentation:  A 57-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of fatigue  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss over the past four weeks. He also reported a new onset low-grade fever. Further interrogation revealed intermittent migratory arthralgia and a loss of appetite.  The patient has a past medical history significant for type II diabetes mellitus well-controlled on metformin  hypertension managed with amlodipine  and tobacco abuse (30 pack-year history). He has no known allergies.  Physical examination revealed a dentition problem. Cardiac auscultation demonstrated a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Additionally  arterial blood pressure was 130/70mmHg  he had a heart rate of 90 bpm  and a slight fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius. He had no physical signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Initial laboratory findings indicated a mild elevation in inflammatory markers with a white blood cell count of 11.0 x 10^9/L. Other blood tests were normal  including kidney and liver function tests.  Due to suspicion of infective endocarditis  blood cultures were taken and transthoracic echocardiography was performed. The echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of NVIE.  Discussions:  Culture reports showed the growth of Streptococcus sanguinis  a viridans group streptococci after 72 hours of incubation. This supported the diagnosis of NVIE due to its strong association with poor dental hygiene in literature. As per the American Heart Association guidelines  the patient was put on a regimen of intravenous crystalline penicillin and gentamicin.  NVIE largely affects males in their late middle age. Having diabetes and hypertension and being a chronic smoker  this patient belonged to a high-risk category. Besides  poor dental hygiene was a significant risk factor that led to the Streptococci sanguinis bacteremia and subsequent NVIE.  Outcome and Follow Up:  With the initiation of antibiotic therapy  the patient's symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent days. He was discharged after four weeks of treatment with close follow-up arranged with Infectious Diseases and Cardiology departments. In subsequent outpatient visits  he demonstrated good recovery and abstinence from smoking. There were stress on the importance of good dental hygiene and regular dental health check-ups to prevent any potential recurrence.   Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering NVIE in patients with new onset non-specific symptoms and identified risk factors. Early detection and prompt treatment of NVIE are critical to minimize the associated high morbidity and mortality.

Case Description:  The patient  a 52-year-old Hispanic male  who works as a construction worker  reported to the emergency department complaining primarily of fever  night sweats  weight loss  and fatigue that had persisted over the last four weeks. He was a non-smoker and moderate alcohol drinker.   Past Medical History:  The patient has been medically managed for hypertension for the past ten years and has no history of diabetes or other chronic illnesses. There was no personal or family history of cardiac disease. He had no known allergies. His last visit to the hospital was five years ago due to a minor work-related injury. The patient denied any illicit drug use.  Clinical Evaluation and Investigations:  Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.7°C related to fever and fatigue. There were no visible skin lesions  but a systolic murmur was audible upon chest auscultation. No other abnormalities were found during the examination.   Blood cultures were obtained  which subsequently grew Staphylococcus aureus. Laboratory analysis showed elevated inflammatory markers  C-reactive protein  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Complete blood count revealed mild anemia and leukocytosis.   An echocardiogram was performed revealing vegetations on the mitral valve  consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve IE.  Treatment:  Empirical antibiotic therapy was initially started with Vancomycin and Gentamicin  according to international guidelines for Staphylococcus aureus IE. Once susceptibility results came back  antibiotic therapy was de-escalated to Oxacillin. The patient showed significant improvement after two weeks of treatment.  Even though surgical intervention was considered  it was deferred due to patient's stability and the absence of heart failure signs or septic emboli.  Follow-Up and Outcome:  The patient completed a six-week course of antibiotic therapy with regular monitoring of therapeutic drug levels and renal function. The repeated echocardiogram post-treatment showed the disappearance of the vegetations and no valvular dysfunction. His symptoms of fever  night sweats  and fatigue resolved  and he reported improved energy and resumption of his regular activities.   Discussion:  This case is illustrative of native-valve infective endocarditis commonly found in patients with no prior history of structural heart disease. The patient's long period of vague symptoms before diagnosis highlights the sometimes-insidious nature of IE. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy were essential components in the successful treatment of this patient's condition. This patient will benefit from regular follow-ups to ensure cardiac function and prompt assessment if symptoms re-appear.   Conclusion:  Native-valve infective endocarditis can be fatal if left untreated. This case report emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Regular follow-up and lifestyle modification  including hypertension management  are essential for preventing any recurrence of the infection.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,46,Title: A Case Report on a 65-Year-Old Male with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Abstract: We report the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE) and managed with a combination of medical therapy and surgical intervention. This case demonstrates the necessary vigilance required for early detection of NVE and the immediate application of appropriate interventions.  Case report:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male  a smoker with a past medical history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a four-week history of progressive dyspnea  low-grade fever  and weight loss. The patient was not drug addicted and did not have any underlying heart conditions or known immunodeficiencies.  Physical examination revealed him to be hemodynamically stable but febrile at 38.3°C with pale conjunctiva  peri-oral cyanosis  and peripheral edema. His cardiovascular exam was notable for a new murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border. No Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  or Roth spots were seen.  Laboratory tests showed a raised ESR and CRP  indicating inflammation. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis and anemia. An elevated BUN and slightly reduced GFR suggested kidney involvement. EKG displayed non-specific T-wave changes. Blood cultures yielded Streptococcus viridans  and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a 1.5 cm x 1 cm mobile vegetation on the mitral valve's anterior leaflet.  Given the clinical presentation  laboratory findings  positive blood culture  and TEE evidence  he was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He was promptly initiated on intravenous antibiotics based on sensitivity testing.   Despite the initial medical management  the patient developed congestive heart failure symptoms due to significant mitral valve regurgitation secondary to leaflet destruction by the infective process. Surgery was considered necessary due to worsening heart failure  despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient underwent a successful mitral valve replacement.  Post-surgery follow-up showed his symptoms had markedly improved  and repeat blood cultures were found to be negative. The patient was set on a prolonged course of targeted antibiotics and was advised for regular follow-ups.  Conclusion: The case highlights the critical importance of high clinical suspicion and prompt comprehensive evaluation in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms. Despite advances in microbiology and imaging  NVE continues to be a severe disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. This case reinforces the role of early diagnosis  appropriate antibiotic therapy  and timely surgical intervention in managing native-valve endocarditis effectively.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,48,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged African American Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A challenge in the field remains the accurate diagnosis  especially in at-risk populations. Here  we present the case of native-valve IE in an otherwise healthy African American female patient.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 53-year-old African American female  with an unremarkable past medical history  residing in Fort Worth  Texas. She is a non-smoker  with occasional alcohol consumption and no significant family history of heart disease. The patient earns a living as a primary school teacher.   Clinical findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of generalized malaise  intermittent fever  and shortness of breath. She also complained of a new and progressively worsening arthralgia. No known recent dental procedures or infections were reported. Physical examination showed a diastolic murmur best heard at the apex  slight splenomegaly  and non-tender petechiae on her legs.   Diagnostic Assessment: Preliminary lab investigations showed an elevated white cell count (17000 /mcL) and C-reactive protein level (42 mg/L). Her ESR was also raised (65 mm/hr). Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed large mobile vegetations on her mitral valve leaflets without significant regurgitation or stenosis. The rest of the valvular apparatus and the heart chambers were normal. These findings were confirmatory of native-valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).  Therapeutic Interventions: The patient was started on empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and gentamicin as per local guidelines. After the sensitivity results  the patient was successfully treated with 4 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone alone.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient responded well to the treatment with marked improvement in her clinical condition. A follow-up TTE at six weeks did not show any vegetations. The patient was educated about the necessity of prophylactic antibiotics before any future dental procedures or surgeries.  Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosing IE and underscores that IE can occur even in individuals without a significant past medical history. This is especially critical in minority populations that have been traditionally underrepresented and potentially understudied  as noted in this case with an African American female. Timely diagnosis and management significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in IE.   Informed consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,49,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Moroccan Male: A Case Report  Introduction  This case report documents the clinical presentation  diagnosis  management  and outcome of native-valve infective endocarditis in a 54-year-old Moroccan male  taking into account relevant demographic and clinical factors.  Case Presentation  A 54-year-old Moroccan male  with a previous medical history of poorly controlled type II diabetes and concealed tobacco usage  was admitted to our facility with severe malaise  intermittent fever  and weight loss over the past three months. The patient reported a recent dental abscess  for which he took broad-spectrum antibiotics without medical supervision. He had no previous history of cardiac disease  and denied any family history of cardiac illnesses. He has been living in low socio-economic conditions with substandard sanitation.  On admission  his vital signs were within normal range with a slightly elevated temperature (37.8C). Physical examination revealed Janeway lesions on the palms and soles  along with weight loss and pallor. The patient was fairly cooperative and alert but appeared fatigued. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.   Two sets of blood cultures were obtained from different sites  which subsequently grew Streptococcus viridans  a common pathogen implicated in native-valve infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on an aortic valve consistent with vegetation.  The diagnosis was consistent with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). The patient was subsequently started on empirical parenteral antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and gentamicin based on local susceptibility patterns.  Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy  the patient developed acute heart failure after one week of treatment  likely secondary to aortic valve destruction and subsequent severe aortic regurgitation. He was urgently referred for surgical intervention where he successfully underwent aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis.  The patient was further managed for his underlying diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents  diet modification  and lifestyle changes. Upon a six-month follow-up visit  the patient reported significant improvement in his overall health and no recurrence of endocarditis symptoms. Long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy was continued under careful supervision to ensure complete eradication of the infection.  Conclusions:  This case emphasizes the link between poor dental hygiene  misuse of antibiotics  underlying non-cardiac comorbidities  and the development of native-valve infective endocarditis. It serves as a reminder for appropriate and superintended use of antibiotics  regular dental check-ups  and importance of good glycemic control in patients with diabetes to prevent serious secondary infections like NVIE.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,53,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Caucasian Female Patient with a Past Medical History of Mitral Valve Prolapse: A Case Report   Introduction: This case report presents the occurrence and management of native-valve infective endocarditis in an elderly Caucasian female patient with a history of mitral valve prolapse in Maine  USA  showing a complex aspect of clinical management among vulnerable populations.   Case Presentation: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female of non-Hispanic descent currently living in an assisted care facility. She has a well-documented medical history of mitral valve prolapse  diagnosed 15 years prior. Other parts of her past medical history include uncontrolled hypertension  managed by diuretic medication  chronic renal disease due to long-term hypertension  and osteoarthritis which often causes her moderate to severe pain. The patient is also a former smoker  quit 20 years ago  with an estimated 15 pack-years history.  She was brought to our healthcare facility presenting with non-specific symptoms that have persisted and gradually worsened over three weeks  including fever with chills and fatigue  reduced appetite  weight loss  and night sweats  with no recent history of travel or known source of infection detected.  An initial set of blood cultures were taken upon admission  and she was started empirically on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and gentamicin due to the high suspicion of infective endocarditis given her history of mitral valve prolapse. Electrocardiogram and echocardiography were also performed  resulting in visual confirmation of possible vegetation on the mitral valve.  Final blood culture results confirmed Streptococcus viridans bacteremia  and the antibiotic regimen was then transitioned to tailored treatment. The patient's course in the hospital was complicated by renal function deterioration and the development of heart failure symptoms  which prompted adjusting her antibiotic therapy and starting her on heart failure medications.  The patient was managed by a multidisciplinary team including cardiologists  infectious disease specialists  and nephrologists  given her complex comorbidities. Surgical intervention was deemed too high risk due to her impaired renal function and overall frail condition. Instead  she was given conservative medical management and was closely monitored for her cardiac  renal functions  and systemic signs of sepsis.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the severity and complexity of managing infective endocarditis especially in elderly patients with several co-morbidities. It emphasizes the importance of early detection  adequate treatment  and diligent monitoring to prevent further complications. It also highlights that a team-based approach involving multiple specialities is crucial for managing such complex cases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,54,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female: A Case Report  Patient Presentation:  A 45-year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with the chief complaints of fever  malaise  fatigue  and a new-onset heart murmur that had evolved over the past three weeks. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin  intermittent intravenous drug use  and no known allergies. She lives in an urban setting and works as a cleaner. She denied any recent dental work or invasive medical procedures.  Vitals & Examination:  On examination  the patient had a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F)  HR - 102/min  BP - 98/60 mm Hg  RR - 20/min  and oxygen saturation - 95% on room air. The patient appeared pale and fatigued  with splinter hemorrhages in her nails and Janeway lesions on both palms and soles. On systemic examination  a new grade III/VI systolic murmur was audible over the aortic area.   Investigations & Diagnosis:  A diagnosis of infective endocarditis was suspected based on the clinical findings. Laboratory tests showed an increased white blood cell count at 16 000 cells/µl  elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at 56 mm/hr  and C-reactive protein at 65 mg/L  indicating an active infection. Three sets of blood cultures revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus.  An echocardiogram showed an oscillating intracardiac mass on an aortic valve consistent with vegetation  along with moderate aortic regurgitation  corroborating the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment & Progress:  The patient was promptly started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin. After susceptibility testing  the regimen was narrowed to IV nafcillin  which was continued for six weeks. The patient's conditions improved over the first 10 days  with decreasing fever and leukocyte count. Regular echocardiograms showed decreasing vegetation size. However  severe aortic regurgitation remained.   She was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for valve replacement but declined surgery due to personal beliefs. Therefore  the patient was managed conservatively with continuation of antibiotics and cardiac medications. She will be closely followed up in the outpatient clinic and educated regarding the importance of good glycemic control and cessation of intravenous drug use.  Morbidity & Prognosis:  Studies suggest that nearly 25% of patients with native valve endocarditis may require surgical intervention due to heart failure  persistent infection  or to prevent systemic embolism. The patient has higher risks of complications due to her choice of refusing surgery  existing diabetes  and intravenous drug use  making her case critical with a guarded prognosis.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with new-onset murmurs and non-specific symptoms such as fever and malaise  especially in high-risk populations like intravenous drug abusers. Healthcare providers must advocate for proper management  including surgery if necessary  to prevent irreversible damage and potential mortality.

Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare  life-threatening disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Native-valve endocarditis remains a significant health concern  especially among the elderly individuals.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of persistent fever  chills  and fatigue  with recently developed dyspnoea. She was previously healthy until three weeks ago when these symptoms began to gradually manifest. No known drug allergies were reported. She had no history of intravenous drug use  no recent dental procedures  and no family history of heart diseases.   Clinical Findings: On initial examination  she had a fever of 39.2°C  heart rate of 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory investigations showed elevated white blood cell count and raised C-reactive protein. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the mitral valve along with moderate mitral regurgitation highly suggestive of infective endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was then performed which confirmed the diagnosis by demonstrating a large vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  Therapeutic Intervention: Intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin were initiated as per the American Heart Association guidelines for Streptococcus viridans endocarditis. Despite 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics  the patient's clinical condition deteriorated due to ongoing sepsis and heart failure secondary to severe mitral regurgitation. Cardiac surgery was consulted and she successfully underwent mitral valve replacement surgery.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient showed significant improvement of her symptoms post-operatively. She was then discharged on a prolonged course of oral antibiotics for six weeks. Follow-up echocardiography four weeks later showed the prosthetic mitral valve was functioning well and there were no signs of residual infection.  Conclusions: In the elderly population  early recognition and treatment of infective endocarditis can be life-saving. This case underscores the crucial role of a high index of suspicion  rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and timely surgical intervention when necessary.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,57,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Diabetes-Concomitant Male Patient: A Clinical Case  Introduction: Infective endocarditis is typically an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and valves. Native-valve infective endocarditis relates to such infection occurring in individuals with no history of valve surgery. This report concerns a patient with no history of intravenous drug use or valve defects but presented with native-valve infective endocarditis with concomitant diabetes mellitus.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of general malaise  fever  and recent-onset exertional dyspnea. His past medical history was remarkable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 31.2kg/m^2. He’s a non-smoker and consumes moderate quantities of alcohol.  On examination  he was febrile  with a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius. His blood pressure was 115/75 mmHg  pulse rate was 100 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade II/IV diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. There was no evidence of any peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis.  Investigations and Management:  The patient was admitted under suspect of infective endocarditis. Initial blood tests revealed elevated white cell counts and C-reactive protein. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was commenced on empirical intravenous antibiotics. Trans-thoracic echocardiography confirmed the presence of a mobile echodense structure attached to the ventricular side of the mitral valve leaflet  suggestive of vegetation.  The blood culture results  available after 48 hours  revealed Gram-positive cocci identified as Streptococcus bovis. The antibiotic regime was then narrowed down to penicillin G and gentamicin according to the sensitivity pattern.  Conclusion:  The unique aspect of this case is the development of native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient with no other identifiable risk factor other than poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and obesity. It’s noteworthy that these factors  while contributing to an increased risk of infection  have not typically been implicated in the development of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further research is required to clarify this potential association.   The patient responded well to the focused antibiotic therapy and showed clinical recovery. There was a significant reduction in vegetation size upon repeating the echocardiography after six weeks of treatment. The patient was advised to maintain control of his blood sugar level rigorously and to seek early medical attention should he experience similar symptoms in the future.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,58,Title: A Case Report of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Male with Pre-existing Rheumatic Heart Disease  Patient Demographic and Medical History:  Mr. A is a 54-year-old Caucasian male working as a truck driver  who presented to the emergency department with an approximately three-week history of malaise  weakness  and low-grade fever.? He resides in a suburban neighborhood of San Francisco  California and is not aware of any familial diseases or prominent genetic disposition to cardiovascular diseases.   He has a past medical history (PMH) significant for rheumatic heart disease (RHD)  a diagnosis established ten years earlier due to recurrent rheumatic fever during his childhood. His compliance with prophylactic antibiotic treatment was inconsistent due to his mobile work demand. He is also a heavy smoker (30 pack-years) and reports occasional alcohol intake but denies any illegal drug use. He is married for 27 years and has two adult children.   Clinical Findings:  On arrival  Mr. A was found to be febrile (38C)  and laboratory results revealed an elevated WBC count (15 x 10^3/uL) with significant neutrophilia  indicating an ongoing systemic infection. Blood cultures were taken  and wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated.   On further cardiac evaluation with echocardiography  consequent to a new murmur noted on physical examination  a large mobile vegetation was identified on the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation  satisfying the major criteria for infective endocarditis (IE).  Microbiological Assessment: Microbiological analysis of the blood cultures showed growth of Streptococcus viridans  a native oral flora typically associated with native valve infective endocarditis if aspir or underlying valvular heart disease is present.   Management and Outcome: Mr. A was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis secondary to Streptococcus viridans. He was started on IV Penicillin and Gentamicin as per the standard treatment guidelines. Post six weeks of IV antibiotics  there was a significant improvement in his symptoms; however  the size of vegetation and the severity of mitral regurgitation remained almost unchanged. Hence  patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgery and underwent successful mitral valve replacement with bioprosthetic material.  Follow-Up:  On follow-up one month post-operatively  the patient reported significant improvement of dyspnea and fatigue. He was highly encouraged to quit smoking and taking antibiotic prophylaxis before future dental procedures to prevent recurrent infective endocarditis. The importance of adherence to the prescribed antibiotics and follow-up cardiac check-ups was emphasized.   Conclusions:  This case demonstrates the development of native valve endocarditis in the setting of pre-existing rheumatic heart disease. High suspicion for IE is warranted in patients presenting with prolonged febrile illness  history of RHD  and new cardiac murmur. Early detection and appropriate management  including timely surgical intervention  are crucial to a positive prognosis. Encouraging smoking cessation  adherence to prophylactic antibiotic regimens  and follow-up are vital for prevention of recurrent IE in such high-risk individuals. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,59,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female with a History of Intravenous Drug Use  Case Presentation:  A 45-year-old Caucasian female presented herself to the emergency room with a two-week history of fever  chills  fatigue  and notable weight loss. Gait instability and occasional moments of confusion were also reported. The patient resides in a suburban area and declares herself as an active intravenous drug user  a habit which she has been struggling to overcome for the last 7 years.  Medical History:  Upon further probing  it was discovered that she has a past medical history of recurrent skin abscesses  chronic hepatitis C infection  and depression. She also reports having a heart murmur in her childhood but was never treated or monitored and denies any familial history of heart disease. She has not been seeking professional medical care on a regular basis due to financial constraints and fear of stigmatization. She is a current tobacco smoker and declares occasional alcohol consumption.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). The heart exam revealed a loud pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex and a diastolic rumble at the lower left sternal border. Skin inspection showed multiple track marks indicating intravenous drug use  along with few petechiae. Neurological examination revealed mild cognitive impairment assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Her initial blood work showed leukocytosis with prominent left shift  anemia  elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate)  and slightly impaired renal function. Three sets of blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus againness - a highly suggestive evidence of infective endocarditis. Electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities.   Further diagnostic work-up included a transesophageal echocardiogram  that confirmed the presence of a large mobile vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  observed in conjunction with a significant mitral regurgitation. These were strongly supportive of a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Patient's course and therapy:  Following multidisciplinary discussion  the patient was started on a course of appropriate antibiotics  as per the guidelines suggested by the American Heart Association  for Streptococcal infective endocarditis. The psycho-social service team and addiction specialty teams were consulted to manage her addiction issues and cognitive decline. Due to the large size of the vegetation and evidence of systemic complications  urgent surgical intervention for valve replacement was also considered.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of thorough clinical and social history taking  particularly focusing on drug misuse in the setting of potential infective endocarditis. The management of infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users can be complex  requiring a multi-disciplinary approach  stretching beyond just the microbial treatment  and addressing underlying social and psychological issues.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,60,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged  Caucasian Male  Patient Information:  Mr. Johnson is a 54-year-old  Caucasian male of average build  who works as a carpenter. He presented to our hospital with a one-week history of persistent fever associated with night sweats  malaise  and weight loss. He had a past medical history of moderate rheumatoid arthritis but had been in good health otherwise. He never smoked and drank alcohol only socially. There was no recent history of intravenous drug use.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed an ill-looking patient. He was febrile (38.2°C)  with a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. A new early diastolic murmur was heard at the left upper parasternal area  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Multiple Janeway lesions were apparent on the palms and soles on further examination.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Initial blood tests showed an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein  suggesting an infectious process. Blood cultures taken on three different occasions turned out positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a large (1.5 cm X 2 cm)  mobile vegetation on the aortic valve with associated significant aortic regurgitation and dilatation of the aortic root. The findings were consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics (nafcillin and gentamicin)  following Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines. Rheumatology was consulted for the management of his autoimmune disease in the setting of the infection. After two weeks of treatment  the patient’s symptoms diminished  and inflammatory markers started to decline.  The patient was recommended for surgical intervention due to the large size of the vegetation  signs of uncontrolled infection  and presence of significant aortic regurgitation. He underwent successful aortic valve replacement and was discharged after being stabilized and asymptomatic. Antibiotics were continued post-surgery for six weeks. On three-month follow-up  the patient was doing well with no signs of recurrent infection.  Conclusion:   This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management of native-valve infective endocarditis  a potentially life-threatening condition. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for this disease in patients presenting with persistent fever and new cardiac murmurs  even in the absence of traditional risk factors such as intravenous drug use.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,61,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Adult Male: A Case Report  Patient Information:   A 76-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our medical facility with persistent fever  malaise  and weight loss. The patient resides in a suburban community  is retired  and lives with his spouse. His family history was non-contributory.  Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of type II diabetes managed with metformin  hypertension controlled with lisinopril  occasional atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone  and no known allergies. He had undergone a prostatectomy 10 years ago due to benign prostatic hyperplasia but currently had no urological complaints. He had never smoked and reported moderate alcohol consumption.   Symptoms:  Over the past month  the patient experienced a consistent fever of 38.5°C  along with fatigue  muscle aches  and a weight loss of 5kgs  prompting his visit to the hospital.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  a heart murmur was heard in the aortic region and Janeway lesions were observed on the palms and soles. The patient appeared pale and mildly breathless. Lab tests revealed elevated white blood cell count (WBC 13000/uL) with a left shift  increased ESR (80mm/hr)  and C-reactive protein (CRP; 56 mg/L). His kidney function tests showed impaired renal function; serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dL. Blood sugar and other laboratory parameters were within the normal range.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings and investigations  the diagnosis was native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). Blood cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus as the causative agent. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) visualized a vegetation on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis.  Treatment:  The patient was treated with a six-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin  as per the current treatment regimen for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis. His condition improved gradually over the treatment course with resolution of fever and decline in inflammatory markers.  Outcome:  At a three-month follow-up  the patient has remained fever-free and without symptoms. Echocardiography showed a reduction in the size of the vegetation on the aortic valve. He was recommended regular monitoring of cardiac status and liver and renal function tests.   This case highlights the importance of establishing a prompt diagnosis of infective endocarditis in elderly patients presenting with persistent fever  especially in those with predisposing conditions like diabetes  hypertension  and atrial fibrillation. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving patient outcomes for this serious and potentially fatal disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,62,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male  Introduction: Non-rheumatic native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious cardiovascular condition  often associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Here  we discuss a case of a 53-year-old Caucasian male patient presenting with IE  highlighting clinical  diagnostic  treatment  and follow-up aspects of the condition.  Case Presentation: A 53-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use  Hepatitis C  and alcohol abuse was admitted to the emergency department. The patient had been experiencing persistent fever  malaise  shortness of breath  and intermittent chest pain for the past three weeks. Chronic cough and unintentional weight loss of around 4 kg over the last month were also noted. He was unemployed and reported no recent hospitalizations or dental procedures. No family history of any cardiac or infectious diseases was noted.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed poor dental hygiene  pallor  a diastolic murmur in the aortic area  bilateral crackles on lung auscultation  and peripheral stigmata of IE  like Osler nodes and Janeway lesions. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were also palpated on abdominal examination.  Diagnostic Assessment: Routine blood tests showed leukocytosis  anemia  and increased inflammatory markers (ESR  CRP). Liver enzymes were raised  correlating with the patient's hepatic condition. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  confirming suspicion of bacterial endocarditis as per the Duke Criteria. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms revealed vegetations on the native aortic valve  moderate aortic regurgitation  and an aortic root abscess.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately initiated on empirical antibiotic therapy  which was later tailored according to the culture and sensitivity report. Urgent surgical intervention was planned due to the presence of complications (aortic abscess and severe aortic regurgitation)  and an aortic valve replacement was performed.  Follow Up: The postoperative period was uneventful  and the patient showed significant symptomatic improvement. He was discharged on a long-term antibiotic regimen and regular follow-ups were scheduled. Improved dental hygiene was strongly advised. The patient was also referred to addiction counselling services for substance abuse management.  Conclusion: This case report underscores the importance of early recognition and management of IE in high-risk populations  with a focus on a comprehensive diagnostic approach and the implementation of appropriate drug and surgical treatment strategies. Long-term follow-ups are essential to monitor the patient's clinical condition  cardiac function  and to ensure successful substance abuse management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,63,Case Report: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged African American Male  Patient Profile:  Demographics: African-American Male  Aged 57  Occupation: Unemployed  Marital Status: Divorced  Location: Urban Area; Patient currently residing in Chicago  Illinois  Living Situation: Lives alone in a rented apartment.  Social History: The patient smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day and reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Medical History:  The patient has well-controlled hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years and a history of intravenous drug use although he has been clean for the last two years. He is currently on medication for both conditions  receiving Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. He has a family history of heart disease.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was admitted with a week's history of fever  chills  night sweats  and increased fatigue. The patient also reported weight loss and loss of appetite.  Clinical Examination:  Upon examination  he was found to have a low-grade fever of 38.2 °C and a heart rate of 110 bpm. Cardiac examination showed a new murmur and a few painless lesions on his fingers and palms  compatible with Janeway lesions.  Investigations:  Three different sets of blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a 2.1 cm vegetation on the ventricular side of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Laboratory test reports showed elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level. The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Course:  The patient was initiated on empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and gentamicin. He showed clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment  with resolution of fever and decrease in fatigue. However  due to the size of the vegetation and the continued presence of the mitral regurgitation despite antibiotic therapy  it was decided to refer the patient for valve replacement surgery. The patient successfully underwent mitral valve replacement and post-operatively continued on intravenous antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks.   Follow up:  After discharge  he was on regular follow-up with cardiology and infectious disease clinics. After six months  he remains clinically stable with regular adherence to his medication regimen.  This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis and the potential need for surgical interventions even if there is clinical improvement on antibiotic therapy. It also highlights the relationship between a history like that of our patient's - including smoking  controlled diabetes and hypertension  and prior intravenous drug use - and the risk for developing this serious condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,64,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Diabetic Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis is a life-threatening bacterial or fungal infection of the heart valves  which is relatively uncommon but potentially fatal if not quickly diagnosed and treated. This report deals with a case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a middle-aged male patient.  Patient Information:  The patient is a 50-year-old African American male with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  recurrent staphylococcal skin infections  and a 20 pack-year smoking history. The patient resides in an urban middle-class neighborhood in New York City and works as an auto mechanic. He is married  with 2 children. His family history revealed that his mother had type II diabetes and died from a stroke in her late sixties  and his father had hypertension and died from heart failure.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the hospital primarily complaining of 2 weeks of worsening fever  fatigue  a new heart murmur  and unexplained weight loss. He also reported having shortness of breath  night sweats  and occasional confusion.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination showed the patient was febrile with temperature of 38.7 °C  blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur. Ophthalmic examination demonstrated Roth spots  and Janeway lesions were observed on the palms and soles. Auscultation of the lung fields was normal.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood cultures revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed vegetation on the patient’s native mitral valve  indicative of infective endocarditis. The patient's poorly controlled diabetes  combined with his history of recurrent staphylococcal skin infections and smoking  were factors that potentially contributed to his developing infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initiated on tailored intravenous antibiotic treatment regimen based on the blood culture sensitivity result. The glycaemic status was addressed and blood sugar was controlled with insulin therapy. Through consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon  decision for surgical intervention was postponed  and focus remained on antimicrobial therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  After six weeks of tailored antibiotic treatment  the patient's fever subsided and his symptoms gradually improved. A repeat echocardiogram showed a reduction in the vegetation size. He was discharged with oral antibiotic regimen and a strict follow-up for his diabetes management.  Conclusion:  The case highlighted the importance of prompt recognition and early aggressive treatment of native valve infective endocarditis. Also  it emphasized on the need of control of comorbidities  like diabetes  in preventing severe complications or the progress of the disease. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,65,Title: A Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart valves that can lead to severe complications if not recognized and treated promptly. Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) refers to the disease occurring in patients without prior valve replacement.   Patient Information:   The patient is an 80-year-old post-menopausal female  residing in an assisted living facility in New York. She is a retired bank manager  a lifelong non-smoker  and occasional alcohol-user  with no family history of IE.  Past Medical History:  The patient has been living with a history of hypertension for the last 20 years  managed with Lisinopril and Metoprolol. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10 years ago and has been under a dietician for dietary management and continuous use of Metformin. Five years earlier  she was diagnosed with mild mitral regurgitation and has been under observation with routine outpatient follow-ups. The patient received regular dental care  with her last dental cleaning procedure done 3 months ago.   Case Presentation:  The patient was admitted to the department of cardiology with complaints of fever  night sweats  malaise  and intermittent palpitations over the last 3 weeks. On examination  she displayed a murmur on auscultation  with occasional irregular heart sounds  but no other significant findings were observed. A set of blood cultures were obtained  which grew Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetation on the mitral valve.   These findings  coupled with clinical symptoms and blood culture results  led to the diagnosis of NVIE. Given the patient's advanced age and history of diabetes and hypertension  she was considered high-risk. Consequently  the patient was initiated on appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and gentamycin  following which symptoms gradually decreased.   Conclusion:  The case illustrates NVIE in an elderly female patient with pre-existing cardiac and metabolic conditions. Further investigation is required regarding the potential correlation between such conditions and the risk or progression of NVIE. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment is emphasized  given the potential for severe complications  especially in high-risk individuals. Finally  the role of routine dental care in preventing IE deserves further investigation  particularly in elderly individuals with previous valve pathology.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,66,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Caucasian Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report describes the presentation  diagnosis  and management of infective endocarditis in a 78-year-old Caucasian female. Despite the overall rarity of this disease  the incidence of infective endocarditis is higher in men  and in those aged 60 or above. This case report aims to contribute to the literature on infective endocarditis  highlighting its presentation in an elderly female patient.  Case Presentation:  A 78-year-old Caucasian woman  living in rural Pennsylvania  was admitted to the hospital with a week-long history of progressive shortness of breath  low-grade fever  and generalized malaise. Her past medical history included hypertension  atrial fibrillation  and osteoarthritis. She was on multiple medications  including warfarin  metoprolol  and lisinopril. The patient has been a life-long non-smoker and consumed minimal alcohol. There is no family history of cardiac diseases or infections.  On physical examination  she appeared chronically ill  and her vitals were stable  albeit her blood pressure was on the low side (90/50 mmHg). Cardiovascular examination revealed an early diastolic murmur and a mid-systolic click. Other physical findings included splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed and Osler nodes noted on her fingers.   Investigations:  Given her presentation  a blood culture was determined and echocardiography was scheduled. The blood culture demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. The transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of two vegetations (10mm and 8mm) on her native mitral valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Management and Follow-Up:  The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis and started on intravenous vancomycin. Cardiology was involved for possible valve replacement consideration. The patient responded well to the antibiotic therapy and showed significant clinical improvement. Surgery was deferred due to the patient's frailty and improving clinical condition. Her condition was stabilized  and she was discharged with a home healthcare plan  including continued antibiotic therapy. The patient was asked to visit the outpatient clinic for a follow-up  where periodic echocardiograms were scheduled.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates that a high clinical suspicion is often necessary for diagnosing infective endocarditis  especially in elderly patients with nonspecific symptoms. Elderly patients' care should be multidisciplinary  involving cardiology  infectious disease specialists  and primary physicians  to guarantee optimal management and follow-up.  Patient Consent:   Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,67,Title: Infective Endocarditis Complicates a Patient with Native Valve  Case Report:  Introduction:  The patient is a Caucasian male  65-year-old retiree with a medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  hypertension  and moderate tobacco use who presented with a 2-week history of fatigue  recurrent fever  and weight loss. He was admitted to the hospital after a physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur along with splinter hemorrhages in the fingernails.   Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with T2DM ten years ago and hypertension five years ago. Both conditions are managed with Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively  with a stable diet and exercise regime. The patient reported smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years. He had no previous heart-related issues nor a history of injection drug use. He also had an allergic reaction to Penicillin two years ago during a dental procedure.  Clinical Findings:  Upon admission  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. Lab tests revealed leukocytosis (14 000 µL)  with elevated ESR (60mm/h) and C-reactive protein (45mg/L). Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a vegetation in the aortic valve suggestive of infective endocarditis. Chest radiographs and CT scan were normal.  Diagnosis:  The patient met the modified Duke criteria for infective endocarditis - two major (positive blood cultures and endocardial involvement) and three minor (fever  vascular phenomena  and immunological phenomena). Combining these clinical findings with his lab results  the patient was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment:  The patient was started on empiric therapy with a combination of Vancomycin and Gentamicin due to his penicillin allergy. Anticoagulants were not prescribed due to risk of cerebral hemorrhage.  Outcome:  The patient responded favorably to treatment. His fever subsided  and he reported a significant improvement in his general well-being. A repeat TTE showed a decrease in vegetation size. The patient was discharged on a six weeks course of antibiotics.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in patients presenting with nonspecific signs and symptoms  especially in those with risk factors such as T2DM  hypertension  and tobacco use. While the patient had a relatively benign course  infective endocarditis can lead to serious consequences such as heart failure or systemic embolization if not promptly recognized and treated.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,68,Title: A Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Female with Previous Mitral Valve Prolapse   Abstract:   We report the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the health care facility with fever  malaise  and progressive shortness of breath. The patient had been previously diagnosed with a mitral valve prolapse but was not on any specific treatment. After an evaluation  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).   Case Presentation:  The patient  a 52-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  fatigue and progressive shortness of breath over a week. The patient is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and denied any illicit drug use. Her medical history revealed a mitral valve prolapse which was diagnosed 2 years ago  but she was not undergoing any specific treatment.  On examination  the patient appeared ill  with a temperature of 38.9°C. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. The patient had no skin lesions  no signs of peripheral emboli  or any evident neurological deficit.   Investigations:  Suspecting IE  blood cultures were drawn that grew Streptococcus sanguinis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and subsequently performed Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)  revealed a vegetation on her mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve IE.  Treatment:  On diagnosis  the patient was immediately started on intravenous penicillin and gentamicin therapy with a planned course of 6 weeks. The patient responded well to treatment  and her symptoms gradually dissipated over a couple of weeks.   Conclusion:  Native-valve IE remains a critical condition requiring an early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic therapy. This case emphasizes the importance of educating patients with known valvular diseases about the potential risk of endocarditis. Regular follow-ups are paramount  particularly in patients with valvular heart diseases  as they are at increased risk of developing infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,69,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female: A Case Report   Introduction: Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the heart valves and endocardial surface. Native valve endocarditis  an infection of the heart's native valves  is more common than prosthetic valve infection  and its incidence increases with age  especially in those over 60 years of age. We report a case of an 82-year-old female patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE).  Case Presentation: An 82-year-old African-American female presented to the emergency department with a seven-day history of progressive shortness of breath  fatigue  and general malaise. She reported her symptoms to be more pronounced during her routine activities.   Her past medical history was significant for hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril and mild osteoarthritis. She has no known allergies and had no previously reported heart conditions. She denies any tobacco  alcohol  or drug use. She has no family history of heart diseases.  On examination  the patient appeared slightly fatigued. Her blood pressure was 145/85 mmHg  heart rate 98 bpm  SpO2 94% on room air  and temperature 37.5-degree Celsius. Cardiac auscultation revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur over the left lower sternal border.  Investigations: Laboratory tests were done  which revealed positive blood cultures significant for Staphylococcus aureus. Her CBC showed a high white blood cell count of 13.5 x 10^3/uL. ESR and CRP levels were significantly elevated. ECG detected no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.   A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed  revealing vegetations on the aortic valve  with moderate aortic valve regurgitation. These findings were consistent with the Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE).   Management and Outcome: She was immediately commenced on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. After the blood culture results  considering the sensitivity and resistance profile  the antibiotics were switched to oxacillin. The patient responded well to the antibiotics and showed signs of clinical improvement over the next few days. Gradually  her symptoms improved and blood cultures sterilized after 2 weeks of therapy.  Due to her age and comorbidities  surgical intervention was deferred  and she was managed medically. The patient completed six weeks of antibiotic therapy. Follow-up TEE after eight weeks showed reduced vegetation size with mild residual aortic regurgitation.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the significance of high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in elderly patients presenting with non-specific symptoms. Swift diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial in native-valve infective endocarditis to prevent complications and to ensure improved patient outcomes. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,70,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Caucasian Male with a History of Intravenous Drug Use  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is an inflammation of the endocardial surface of the heart  mainly affecting the valves  due to infection by microorganisms. It is more common among those with a history of heart disease  those who have undergone invasive procedures  and those with a history of intravenous drug use. We present the case of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis with unique clinical features.   Case Report: The patient was a 45-year-old Caucasian male  unemployed  with a known history of chronic intravenous drug use (primarily heroin) for over 20 years. He presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of progressive malaise  night sweats  weight loss  and a new-onset transient ischemic attack (TIA). There was no history of IV access  dental procedures  or infected skin sores in the recent past. His other medical history included hepatitis C infection  diagnosed 10 years prior  and recurrent bouts of cellulitis due to his drug use. The patient had a long history of non-compliance with medical advice and had disengaged from drug rehabilitation programs in the past. He had no known allergies.  On examination  he was febrile (38.5 degree Celsius) with a heart rate of 100 bpm. Physical examination revealed pallor  poor dentition  and multiple track marks indicative of long-standing intravenous drug use. Cardiac examination showed a new grade III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex.  Blood cultures were drawn  and the results revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large  mobile 15mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  with moderate mitral regurgitation.  The diagnosis of Native valve infective endocarditis (IE) was made and the patient was started on empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone  according to guidelines. His hepatitis C infection was also managed in coordination with a hepatologist. He was referred to cardiothoracic surgery  but he refused surgical intervention.  As a result  he was committed to a long-term plan involving continued intravenous antibiotics  regular follow-ups  and a referral to addiction services for primary management of his underlying illicit drug use. His clinical condition improved over his hospital stay and he was discharged with outpatient antibiotic therapy and close follow up.  Conclusion: This case report underscores the vulnerability of intravenous drug users to native-valve infective endocarditis. It also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care involving addiction services in managing such complex patients. A high index of suspicion  early diagnosis  and aggressive treatment helps in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. However  the patient's lack of willingness to undergo surgical interventions constitutes a major barrier to a full recovery.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,71,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged African-American Male  Introduction: Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but serious infection  often resulting in illness and death. This case report provides an illustrative example of IE in a middle-aged African-American male.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 52-year-old African American male  presented at the emergency department with a week-long history encompassing high fevers  chills  sweats  loss of appetite  and episodes of confusion. He had also been experiencing moderate chest pain that intensified upon lying flat but eased on sitting up. The patient had an unremarkable family health history but had notable past medical history  including untreated hypertension  a fifteen year history of intravenous drug use (IVDU)  and recent rehabilitation for abuse of cocaine and opioids. He had been tobacco-free for three years but had a 15 pack-year smoking history.   Physical examination revealed clammy and mildly jaundiced skin  low blood pressure (90/60mmHg)  elevated heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a temperature of 38.8°C suggestively febrile. Cardiac auscultation discovered an early diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. Auscultation of the lungs uncovered crackles in the lower lung fields. Ophthalmic inspection confirmed Roth’s spots  visual evidence of IE.   Blood cultures positively identified Staphylococcus aureus consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) further validated an aortic valve vegetation measuring approximately 1.5cm by 1.0cm. No valvular insufficiency or damage to surrounding structures was detected  although moderate aortic regurgitation was present.   Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and a subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) indicated no evidence of intracardiac abscess formation or any other form of intracardiac complication. The patient's diagnosis was native-valve infective endocarditis  secondary to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).   The patient was managed with a six-week regimen of intravenous nafcillin to treat MSSA-induced IE. Additionally  blood pressure control was maintained with medications. The patient was also provided with counseling and resources to address his history of substance abuse.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of quick diagnosis and treatment of IE  particularly in vulnerable populations like intravenous drug users. It also stresses the necessity of monitoring and providing comprehensive care for patients with a history of heart disease and concurrent drug use to prevent serious infections like native-valve infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,73,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in An Elderly Female: A Case Report  Patient Demographic Information:  The patient is a 72-year-old African American female  retired  known case of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She has no known allergies and doesn't consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. She has no family history of cardiac illness but most of her family members are diabetic and hypertensive.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient initially presented with new onset dyspnea  loss of appetite  unintended weight loss and low-grade fever persisting for a month.  Investigations:  Physical examination revealed pallor and a diastolic murmur best heard at left mid-sternal border. Laboratory studies revealed a WBC count of 15000 cells/µL  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 50 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 30 mg/dL. Blood cultures were taken and sent for testing. The echocardiogram showed a mobile vegetation of 1.5cm on the aortic valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  Disease Course:  Her condition was complicated by an episode of stroke within 12 hours of her hospital admission. An evaluation for underlying embolic cause was carried out  and a transthoracic echocardiogram was done promptly. It showed the presence of an echogenic non-calcified mass attached to the aortic valve cusps strongly suggestive of vegetation. Cerebral computed tomography ruled out cerebral abscess but confirmed ischemic stroke.  Patient Management:  She was initiated on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for the management of endocarditis. It was then de-escalated to targeted therapy based on her blood culture and sensitivity results which revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  Her condition improved significantly with antibiotics and supportive care. However  given the occurrence of stroke and the relatively large size of vegetations  she was evaluated for urgent surgical intervention. Balancing her age  co-morbidities  and potential complications  it was decided to continue medical management with close monitoring. She was discharged after 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics with a plan for close follow-up.  Conclusions:  The present case illustrates the presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis in an elderly female patient. Importantly  this patient's experience highlights the relevance of taking into account the aging population and their increased vulnerability to this condition  especially those with other comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension.  This case also underlines the importance of an early diagnosis  aggressive antibiotic therapy  and proactive decision-making regarding surgical intervention aided by a multidisciplinary team. The presence of neurological complications should prompt the clinician to evaluate the need for early surgery albeit in the context of the patient’s overall health status and risk-benefit balance.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,74,Title: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male with a History of Rheumatic Heart Disease and Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection with significant morbidity and mortality. IE is most common in older individuals  typically aged 60 years and above. Native valve endocarditis occurs more commonly than prosthetic valve or device-related endocarditis. Herein  we report a case of an elderly patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease and diabetes mellitus  who presented with native valve endocarditis.  Case Presentation: A 74-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent  high-grade fever and unexplained weight loss for a period of 1 month. The patient reported increasing fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week. In the past  he had been diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus which was under control with oral hypoglycemic agents.  On physical examination  the patient appeared lethargic and pale. He was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. Cardiac auscultation revealed a pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex. The patient’s blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits. There was no evidence of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis.  Investigations:  The patient's blood tests showed increased inflammatory markers with a raise in ESR and CRP values. His blood cultures subsequently grew Streptococcus viridans  suggestive of a bacterial infection. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed large vegetations on the mitral valve leaflets  consistent with infective endocarditis.  Treatment:  The patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous penicillin therapy  based on the antibiotic susceptibility of the infecting organism. The patient also received subcutaneous insulin for diabetes. Despite the initiation of antibiotic therapy  the patient remained febrile and symptomatic. After multidisciplinary consultation  decision was taken for surgical intervention. He underwent mitral valve replacement surgery with a bioprosthetic valve.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient's post-operative course was uneventful with resolution of fever  improvement in clinical symptoms  and overall stable condition. He was subsequently started on oral antibiotics and discharged home after 2 weeks. The patient has been regularly followed up in the outpatients department over the past 6 months  displaying a good recovery trajectory.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in elderly patients with a history of rheumatic heart disease presenting with symptoms of unexplained fever  fatigue  and weight loss. Such patients warrant early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment strategies  including surgical intervention when required.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,76,Title: Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 53-Year-Old Male  Introduction  This case report focuses on a 53-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE) in a clinical setting. Previous literature states that native valve infective endocarditis is more common in men  with higher incidence reported for patients between 30 to 60 years old. Ethnicity does not potentiate susceptibility  but certain comorbidities  lifestyle habits  and socioeconomic status can add to the risk of developing this disease. This case illustrates the clinical presentation  diagnostics  treatment  and long-term management of NVE.  Case Presentation  The patient  a 53-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with intermittent fever  chills  and fatigue for the past three weeks. He reported a weight loss of about five pounds within the last month. He also complained of mild  diffuse joint pains and noted dark-colored urine for the past week.  History and Physical Examination  Patient’s past medical history revealed a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus  well-controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents. He had also been treated for hypertension for the past ten years and was on regular medication for the same. The patient was a non-smoker with mild alcohol consumption. He denied any substance abuse or risky sexual behavior. There was no familial history of cardiac conditions.  On physical examination  the patient was febrile (38.5 °C)  had mild pallor with a notable murmur on cardiac auscultation. There were no Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions. Other systems did not reveal any significant abnormalities.  Diagnostic Findings   Given the patient's clinical presentation  the initial working diagnosis was endocarditis. Blood cultures were obtained. Laboratory investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and anemia. The patients' creatinine levels were slightly elevated  indicating possible renal involvement.  Confirmatory diagnosis was made with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)  which showed vegetation on the mitral valve  without significant valvular insufficiency or stenosis.  Management and Outcome  The patient was admitted to the inpatient cardiac unit for antibiotic therapy based on suspected NVE  guided by blood culture results. Upon culture growth  the intravenous antibiotic regimen was adjusted to tailored therapy involving a 6-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin.  The patient’s clinical condition improved with treatment. Follow-up TTE revealed a reduction in vegetation size along with an improvement in the patient’s condition. Education and counseling on risk factor modification  adherence to medications and periodic follow-up visits were emphasized.  Conclusion  This case report illustrates a typical presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis. Prompt diagnosis and early initiation of treatment mitigated the potential averse effects and complications of the disease. This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion for endocarditis in patients presenting with fever and cardiac murmurs  particularly in those with comorbidities.  Future research should focus on strategies to timely recognize  intervene  and manage such cases to improve patient outcomes  reduce healthcare costs  and prevent disease-associated morbidity and mortality. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,77,Title: Severe Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but severe condition indicating infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Despite advancements in diagnostic modalities and treatment  IE continues to have a significant morbidity and mortality rate. This report describes a case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a 56-year-old Caucasian male patient.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male  working as an electrician  with a history of smoking and moderate daily alcohol consumption but no significant past medical history. He had no family history of heart disease. The patient lived in a suburban region in the Midwest United States and had no history of recent travel out of the state.  The patient initially presented to the primary care clinic with complaints of intermittent fever  myalgia  and weight loss for the last six weeks. On physical examination  he had small erythematous lesions on the palms and soles (Janeway lesions) and tiny hemorrhagic spots under his nails (splinter hemorrhages). A systolic murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation.   Investigations:  Given the clinical presentation  IE was suspected and further investigations were ordered  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  The patient was referred immediately to a cardiologist and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed  which showed vegetations on the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy as per the guidelines. Due to the presence of moderate mitral regurgitation and the poor response to the antibiotic therapy  the patient eventually required mitral valve replacement surgery. The post-operative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged on long-term oral antibiotics and was asked to follow up with cardiology regularly. On subsequent follow-up visits  the patient remained symptom-free with a well-functioning prosthetic mitral valve.  Conclusion:  This case report demonstrates the successful diagnosis and management of a relatively late-stage native-valve infective endocarditis in a middle-aged Caucasian male with no significant past medical history. Despite the delayed diagnosis and the development of mitral regurgitation  timely intervention and appropriate treatment resulted in a favorable outcome. This case also highlights the importance of early suspicion and diagnosis in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms like fever and weight loss in the context of suggestive physical findings.

He's an ex-smoker who quit smoking 20 years back. He states he's socially consuming alcohol. He works as a lawyer and leads a sedentary lifestyle. There was no personal or family history of heart diseases.  Past Medical History: He had been previously diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension  both of which are well-controlled with medication (Metformin 1000 mg twice a day and Lisinopril 20 mg once a day). His cholesterol levels have also been in the high-normal range  managed through diet and lifestyle changes. Retired from his job 5 years ago but returned to work due to financial circumstances. An employee health check-up two years ago indicated no remarkable findings.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis: On admission  he was found to be febrile  tachycardic with a regular heart rhythm  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  and mild pallor. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur. There was no evidence of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.   Investigations included blood cultures that showed the growth of Streptococcus viridans and an Echocardiogram which demonstrated a vegetative growth on the native mitral valve indicating infective endocarditis. His HbA1c was 6.5  suggesting good control of diabetes.  Medical Progress: Mr. A was started on intravenous penicillin and gentamicin for streptococcus viridans. After two weeks of therapy  his symptoms significantly improved and he was switched to oral antibiotics. He completed a six-week course under close clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. Two months post-treatment  he remained symptom-free  confirming the successful treatment of native valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a microbial infection of the endothelial surface of the heart. The occurrence of IE in the general population is estimated to be between 1.7 and 6.2 cases per 100 000 person-years  with a higher incidence in males and older adults. This case underscores the importance of considering a diagnosis of IE in patients with persistent fever and constitutional symptoms. It also highlights the importance of early blood cultures and echocardiograms in the management of a febrile patient with a cardiac murmur.  Despite his sedentary lifestyle and age  Mr. A's direct engagement in his care  including compliant medication use  and his good control of diabetes and hypertension likely contributed to his effective recovery. This case demonstrates that with early detection and appropriate treatment  the morbidity associated with infective endocarditis can be significantly reduced.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,81,Title: Streptococcus viridans Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but serious disease worldwide  accounting for about 0.05% of all hospital admissions. Here  we report a case of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) caused by Streptococcus viridans in a 56-year-old Caucasian male.  Case Presentation: A 56-year-old male  a non-smoker with a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  presented to our hospital with a two-week history of intermittent high-grade fever  dyspnea  fatigue  and loss of appetite. The patient worked as an engineer with no other significant exposure history.   There was no family history of cardiac disorder or autoimmune diseases  and patient reported adherence with medications for previously diagnosed conditions. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use. He was not on any long-term immunosuppressive therapy and had no known allergies.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Assessment: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.2°C  heart rate of 105 beats/min  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur; no Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions were observed.  Laboratory test results showed leucocytosis with elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures were obtained that came back positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a 1.2 cm x 1.5 cm mobile vegetative mass on the anterior cusp of mitral valve  with moderate mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis and Treatment: The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans based on the Duke criteria. He was started on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin  which was continued for 4 weeks.  Afterwards  the patient was evaluated for valve surgery considering the large vegetation size and ongoing infection  the decision was made to perform a surgical intervention. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve and made an uneventful recovery.  Discussion: The current case emphasizes the importance of early identification of infective endocarditis  which despite being a rare event  can lead to life-threatening situations if not promptly identified and managed. Streptococcus viridans is a common causative organism  and given its resistance to many antibiotics  the choice of empirical antibiotics should be guided by local resistance patterns.  Conclusion: Timely diagnosis and therapy initiation are pivotal in NVIE  as it is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Both medical and surgical interventions should be considered and balanced  based on the individual's specific clinical context and overall health status.   Meticulous periodic follow-ups post-discharge with a focus on dental hygiene  lifestyle modifications  and medication adherence in these patients may reduce the risk of NVIE recurrence. Further research is mandated to optimize the standard of care for patients with NVIE.

Nail bed splinter hemorrhages and Janeway lesions were also observed.   Investigations: Blood tests showed increased inflammatory markers  and blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus mutans - a common microorganism linked to dental caries and endocarditis. Chest x-ray did not reveal any abnormalities. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia  but no other changes.   Echocardiography showed a significant vegetative growth on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. It had led to a moderate mitral regurgitation. The remaining heart structures appeared normally.  Management: The patient was introduced to intravenous antibiotics (penicillin and gentamycin) per the American Heart Association's guidelines for endocarditis caused by S. mutans. After four weeks of intensive antimicrobial therapy  her symptoms improved considerably  she became afebrile  and repeat blood cultures were negative.  Surgery could not be performed due to her medical condition at the time and a collective decision with her and family members. She received heart failure management  including diuretics  and was referred for a dental abscess treatment to prevent recurrence of endocarditis.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining good oral health since untreated dental caries can lead to serious complications like infective endocarditis. Consideration should be given to S. Mutans in patients with poor dental health presenting with fevers of unknown origin  especially if new murmurs are noted on examination. Moreover  this case is a good reminder that infective endocarditis can affect patients without the traditional risk factors of intravenous drug use or pre-existing heart disease.  Discussion: Surveillance studies across the globe have shown relatively low rates of infective endocarditis among African Americans. This case offers critical insights into the manifestations  diagnosis  and management of native valve endocarditis in this demographic group  underscoring the need to improve dental health practices and provision of adequate healthcare facilities. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,83,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 60-year-old Asian Male with a History of Rheumatic Heart Disease: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis  a serious infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  predominantly affects the heart valves. Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) refers to the infection of native  or non-artificial  valves. Although NVIE is rare  it carries significant morbidity and mortality.   Case Presentation: A 60-year-old Asian male patient presenting to the hospital with a history of rheumatic heart disease  currently prescribed Warfarin due to chronic atrial fibrillation  was admitted with complaints of high-grade intermittent fever  chills  and fatigue for the past two weeks. He has been living with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 8 years managed by Metformin. He is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol.  On physical examination  he had a heart rate of 105 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg  and body temperature of 38.7°C or 102°F. Cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic murmur. Skin examination exhibited Osler’s nodes on his fingers and toes and Janeway lesions on his hands and feet.   A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count indicative of infection. Blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an echodense mass on his mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Outcome: The patient received empirical antibiotic therapy (penicillin and gentamicin) as per the local guidance for native valve infective endocarditis until the susceptibility results were available. After six weeks of intravenous antibiotics under hospital care  the patient’s symptoms improved significantly. Regular follow-ups have been kept to monitor his condition.   Discussion: The patient’s rheumatic heart disease and diabetes mellitus perhaps contributed as risk factors for developing infective endocarditis.  Conclusion: This report underscores the importance of high clinical suspicion for NVIE in patients presenting with fever and heart murmur  especially in individuals with a history of rheumatic heart disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to reduce the risks of significant morbidity and mortality associated with the condition. Compliance with long-term treatment is essential to prevent recurrence and manage any potential complications.   Note: All treatments and diagnostic tests within this case report are in compliance with current medical guidelines and literature concerning NVIE diagnosis and treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,84,Title: Infective Endocarditis in a Native Valve of an Elderly Male - A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe condition often involving the endothelial surface of the heart and its structures  most commonly the valves. Here  we present the case of an elderly male with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Case Report: A 73-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever  fatigue  and progressive shortness of breath for one week. The patient reported a decrease in appetite  unintentional weight loss  and night sweats. He had been previously managed with metformin  lisinopril  and aspirin. There was no history of intravenous drug use  recent dental procedures  or immunosuppressive therapy.  On physical examination  the patient appeared acutely ill with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). The cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal edge. A few petechial rashes were noted on his lower extremities and under his fingernails (splinter hemorrhages). There was no clubbing or osler nodes noted.  Investigations revealed leukocytosis  increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multiple blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus  confirming the diagnosis of bacteremia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large echogenic vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation  consistent with infective endocarditis.  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics in accordance with the sensitivity pattern  including vancomycin and gentamicin. However  due to persistent symptoms  worsening regurgitation  and the high risk of systemic embolization  a decision for surgical intervention was made. He underwent successful mitral valve replacement surgery and was continued on antibiotics thereafter.   The postoperative period was uneventful  and he was discharged on lifelong anticoagulant therapy with warfarin. At a six-month follow-up  the patient was asymptomatic with a functioning prosthetic mitral valve.  Discussion: This case illustrates the management of native-valve infective endocarditis in an elderly patient with cardiovascular risk factors. It underlines the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of IE  including appropriate antibiotic therapy and the potential need for surgical intervention in cases with high embolic risk.  Conclusion: This case report emphasizes the challenges encountered in managing patients with native valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with a history of chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Prompt recognition and optimal management including possibility of surgery are critical to improve patient outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,85,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Presenting with Neurological Deficits in a 63-year-old Male  Patient Profile:   A 63-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department (ED) with one-week history of generalized malaise  intermittent fever  and sudden onset left-sided weakness. He had no significant past medical history. The patient lives alone  is a retired engineer and a non-smoker. He occasionally consumes alcohol in moderation.  Clinical Presentation:   On presentation  vital signs were stable except for a fever of 38.9°C. Neurological examination revealed left upper and lower extremity weakness with a power of 3/5. He also had a noticeable facial droop on the left side suggestive of a stroke. Initial physical exam findings included a diastolic murmur  noted over the aortic area. No other significant findings were noted.   Investigations:  Blood culture showed growth of Streptococcus viridans. Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed vegetations on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). A MRI brain confirmed acute ischemic stroke on the right side.  Treatment and Response:  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics per the Infective Endocarditis (IE) treatment protocol. Consultations were made to the Infectious Disease and Cardiology services for further management of NVIE. Neurology was consulted for the stroke. The patient was also given aspirin for secondary prevention of stroke. His hospital course was complicated by heart failure  for which he was managed with diuretics and vasodilators.  Outcome:   The patient completed a 6-week course of antibiotics. Follow-up TEE at the end of treatment showed resolution of the vegetations  and cultures turned negative.  The patient’s motor deficits improved significantly but did not fully resolve  warranting ongoing physical therapy.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the diversity in presentation of NVIE as it presented with neurologic deficits  consistent with septic embolization. This emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion especially in older patients presenting with stroke and associated cardiac signs and symptoms.   Broad demographic representation within case reports is necessary to understand the entire disease spectrum as this case illustrates infective endocarditis in an elderly Hispanic male  an often-underrepresented group in medical literature. Further research in this domain can drive better awareness and diagnostic strategies to appreciate the subtle nuances in presentation across diverse populations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,86,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 57-Year-Old Male Patient with a Prior History of Congenital Heart Defect: A Case Report   Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but serious condition that involves the infection of the endothelial surface or lining of the heart chambers and valves  usually by bacteria. The diagnosis and management of IE in patients with prior history of congenital heart defects (CHD) are particularly challenging due to increased risk factors. We present a case of a 57-year-old male patient with a history of CHD who developed native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).  Case Presentation:  A 57-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and weight loss. His medical history included a ventricular septal defect  which was corrected surgically during his childhood  hypertension  well-controlled diabetes mellitus type II  and a two-pack-a-day smoking habit for 35 years.  On physical examination  the patient was febrile  the heart sounds revealed signs of a new-onset mitral regurgitation murmur  and tiny red or purple spots on the patient’s skin  a symptom known as petechiae  were observed on the extremities.  Laboratory findings showed marked leukocytosis  increased inflammatory markers - elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia  but no distinct ST or T wave changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a mobile echogenic mass attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve suggestive of a vegetation  and moderate mitral regurgitation.  The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made based on the patient’s symptoms  physical findings  positive blood culture  and the presence of a vegetation on echocardiogram  according to the modified Duke criteria.  The patient was initially treated with intravenous Antibiotic therapy with a combination of Nafcillin and Gentamicin. Despite  the treatment  the patient continued to have persistent fever and positive blood cultures. Given the poor response to medical treatment and the risk of systemic embolization  surgical intervention was determined. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement surgery with a bioprosthetic valve.  Postoperatively  the patient’s fever resolved  and follow-up blood cultures were negative. The patient was discharged on a course of intravenous antibiotics and arranged for regular follow up at the outpatient clinic.   Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the challenges of diagnosing and managing native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient with a prior history of CHD  and the potentially integral role of surgical intervention in patients with poor response to medical management. Multimodality imaging and an interdisciplinary team approach are crucial for improving the outcome of such patients.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,88,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a critical  deadly condition primarily involving the heart valves. Although it has declined over the past decades  native valve endocarditis still signifies a significant portion of IE cases. This report presents a case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Case Presentation:  The patient  a 67-year-old Caucasian retired accountant with a history of heavy tobacco use and hypertension  presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-week history of fever  night sweats  breathlessness  and generalized malaise. Despite no prior history of heart diseases  the patient complained of new-onset mild chest discomfort. There was no history of illicit drug use  dental procedures or recent invasive procedure.  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared weak and dyspneic. There were no visible cutaneous or conjunctival lesions. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. No Janeway lesions  Osler’s nodes  or Roth’s spots were observed. Other examination findings were unremarkable.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (15 200/µL) and C-reactive protein level (180 mg/L). The patient was also anemic with a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL  and a mildly impaired renal function was shown by a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained  which all grew Streptococcus viridans.  A trans-thoracic echocardiogram followed by a trans-esophageal echocardiogram confirmed vegetations on the tricuspid valve with subsequent severe regurgitation  leading to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Management and outcome:  Given the sensitivity profile of the isolated bacteria  the patient was initiated on a 6-week course of intravenous penicillin and gentamicin. In the following weeks  the patient had few instances of rigors and ongoing fevers  indicating a slow response to treatment. Due to the severe tricuspid regurgitation and heart failure symptoms  the patient was referred for valve replacement surgery.  After a month post-surgery  the patient showed significant improvement with normalization of inflammatory markers  and improvement of anemia and kidney function. He was eventually discharged under cardiology review.  Conclusion:  The patient's age  gender  and presentation are consistent with demographic trends reported in literature for native-valve infective endocarditis; older males with underlying cardiovascular issues are at a higher risk. Despite the availability of advanced antimicrobial therapy  surgical intervention remains a cornerstone in managing this condition. Prompt recognition and management of these patients is essential due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with delayed or inappropriate treatment. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,89,Title: An Unusual Presentation of Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Adult with No Known Heart Disease  Description:  I. Patient Demographics  The patient is a 42-year-old Caucasian male construction worker from New York City. He is not a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no significant travel history and denies illicit drug use.  II. Past Medical History  The patient has an unremarkable past medical history with no known incidences of congenital heart disease  rheumatic heart disease  immunodeficiency  or diabetes. He has not had any invasive medical or dental procedures carried out recently. He has no known allergies.  III. Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of persistent low-grade fever  malaise  and weight loss. For the past week  he had also been experiencing intermittent left-sided chest pains that radiated to the shoulders and forearms.  IV. Physical Examination and Diagnostic Tests  On examination  the patient was slightly tachycardiac  with reported heart rate varying between 100-120 bpm. The rest of his vitals were unremarkable. A heart exam revealed a grade II/VI diastolic murmur at the aortic area with no associated rubs or gallops. No other significant cardiovascular  pulmonary  abdominal  or neurological abnormalities were noted.  The patient’s blood test showed leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils. A significant elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) suggested an ongoing inflammatory response. Several sets of blood cultures were drawn  all of which grew Staphylococcus aureus.   A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the aortic valve suggestive of vegetation  confirming a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) highlighted no perivalvular abnormalities.  V. Management and Outcome  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and rifampin) as per sensitivity results from the blood culture. His condition began to improve after the initiation of treatment. He received intravenous antibiotics for six weeks. Repeat blood cultures at the end of six weeks showed no bacterial growth and inflammatory markers returned to normal. A repeat TEE demonstrated a resolution of the vegetation albeit mild aortic regurgitation  most likely due to valve damage caused by the infection.  VI. Conclusion  This case underscores the concept that infective endocarditis can occur even in individuals without traditional risk factors  including congenital heart disease  rheumatic heart disease  or recent invasive procedures. This highlights the importance of considering infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained persistent fever  malaise  and elevated inflammatory markers.

He had no known drug allergies and had no significant family history. He was a former smoker  with a consumption history of 20 cigarettes per day lasting up to 25 years  but was able to quit five years ago. He reported mild alcohol consumption  but denied any illicit drug use.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  both of which were diagnosed ten years ago and have been managed by medication. There is no history of heart disease in his family  and he had no previous cardiac problems. At his last medical check-up three months ago  his blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg and his HbA1c level was 7.2%.  Presenting Complaints: His primary complaints were of constant low-grade fever  shortness of breath  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. He also reported occasional night sweats and recent onset malaise over the past two weeks. He did not have any cough  chest pain  palpitations or edema.  Physical Examination: Mr. J's blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 102 bpm  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and his temperature was 38.2°C. Upon cardiovascular examination  a systolic murmur was noted. Rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Chest X-ray was normal. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Follow-up: Mr. J was admitted and started on empirical antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin). The blood cultures confirmed Staphylococcus aureus as the causative organism. His antibiotic regimen was switched according to the sensitivity pattern. The patient was closely monitored for complications like heart failure and septic emboli. His condition improved considerably after two weeks of treatment. He was discharged with instructions to complete a six-week antibiotic course and regular follow-up appointments.   Outcomes: The patient had a good recovery and was stable during follow-up. His repeat echocardiogram showed a slight reduction in vegetation size. It was deemed that surgical intervention was not required at this point  and he was continued on suitable antibiotic therapy. The patient was referred to cardiac rehabilitation and was educated on lifestyle modification and how to control his diabetes and hypertension. Follow-up echocardiography and routine visits were advised for the patient.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Suitable management can lead to a significant improvement and reduce the need for surgical intervention.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,91,Patient Initials: JS  Age: 55 Years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian  Presenting Problem: The patient came in complaining about a high-grade fever  fatigue  new heart murmur  and unexpected weight loss.   Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of chronic rheumatic heart disease caused by recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever and a recent dental procedure. She has no history of intravenous drug use. She doesn't have any allergies. Her immunization is up to date. Her family history includes ischemic heart disease in her father and type II diabetes mellitus in her mother.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient had a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. The cardiovascular examination revealed the presence of a systolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. Splinter hemorrhages were present on the nail beds  and her fingers also displayed signs of clubbing. The other systemic examination was within normal limits.  Laboratory Results: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count was elevated  with a neutrophilic predominance. Blood cultures showed growth of streptococcus viridans. ELISA for HIV was performed and came out negative.   Imaging and Further Steps: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed thickening and vegetation on the mitral valve. This was confirmed with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)  further strengthening the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis as it correlates with the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.  Infective endocarditis (IE) susceptibility being the highest in the presence of valvular heart disease and history of dental surgery. Due to her chronic rheumatic heart disease  she has a higher risk of contracting native valve endocarditis. Streptococcus viridans bacteria  which typically reside in the mouth  are known to cause IE after dental procedures.  Diagnosis: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  Plan: The patient was admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Antibiotic therapy was started as per the guidelines for streptococcus viridans  which included intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamycin. The patient also required valve replacement surgery due to severe damage caused. The surgery was complicated by heart failure but was eventually controlled with medications.   The patient was in the hospital for six weeks and was discharged on lifelong anticoagulation and regular follow ups for valve monitoring and blood works.   This case underscores the typical presentation of infective endocarditis and illustrates its associated complications. Early detection and appropriate therapeutic strategies are key components in managing this life-threatening condition. Regular dental hygiene will be crucial for this patient to prevent recurrent episodes.   Consent: Obtained
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,92,Title: A case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in Middle-Aged Male  Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe  and often critical  infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  including the heart valves. Characteristically causing valvular insufficiency  congestive heart failure  embolic phenomena  and other multi-organ complications  it demands early diagnosis and adequate treatment to prevent mortality and complexities.  Case report  We present here the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male  with a history of smoking and recreational drug use  who presented to the emergency department with a two week history of generalized malaise  intermittent fever and night sweat. He reported no known allergies. His past medical history revealed an underlying case of hypertension  which was being managed with regular medications.  Physical examination revealed him to be pyrexial with a blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats/minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. An audible diastolic murmur was detected during a cardiovascular examination. On admission  blood cultures were drawn  and laboratory results showed elevated inflammatory markers along with microcytic anemia.  After initial stabilization  further diagnostic procedure incorporated transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)  which highlighted an echogenic mass adherent to the anterior mitral leaflet  supportive of valvular vegetation. Simultaneously  the isolation of Streptococcus viridans from serial blood cultures confirmed the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management of the patient’s condition encompassed a four-week course of antibiotic therapy  specifically intravenous Penicillin G and Gentamicin. The patient showed a favorable response to the treatment and subsequent repeat blood cultures turned out negative. Moreover  a follow-up TTE delineated the resolution of the vegetation although the patient had developed a moderate mitral regurgitation.  Given the patient’s recreational drug use  a referral was also made for substance use counselling and rehabilitation. The patient was discharged with instructions for treatment adherence and regular follow-ups in outpatient clinic and cardiology unit.  Discussion   This case inspires a discussion about the significance of a prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment procedure in managing cases of infective endocarditis  especially among vulnerable populations such as those with a history of substance abuse. It also underlines the importance of addressing underlying issues  such as drug use  in order to prevent future episodes.  In conclusion  native-valve infective endocarditis  although severe in clinical course  can be managed effectively with vigilant approach in diagnosing the condition  coupled with robust therapeutic procedures and follow-up care.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,93,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an 67-Year-Old Male Patient: A Case Report   I. Introduction: Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and typically implies infection of a heart valve or the endocardium itself  without a prosthetic device or repair present. It is predominantly caused by gram-positive bacteria  with Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus being the most common pathogens.  II. Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented to the hospital with a one-month history of intermittent fever  fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He had a past medical history significant for type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and prior tobacco use but discontinued it a decade ago. He had no history of illicit drug use or intravenous drug use.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and short of breath. He had a temperature of 38.5°C  blood pressure 130/85 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. The patient displayed Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes and Janeway lesions on the soles of both feet- signs suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Blood cultures were collected and the patient was started empirically on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a large mobile mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with vegetation. The patient's blood cultures eventually grew Streptococcus viridans. The Duke criteria for infective endocarditis was met with 2 major criteria (positive blood cultures with typical IE organism  and evidence of endocardial involvement by TTE) and 1 minor criterion (vascular phenomena).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin for a total of 6 weeks. After completion of antibiotic therapy  repeated echocardiography showed a resolution of vegetation.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient's symptoms resolved  and he was discharged home in stable condition. He was advised to attend regular follow-ups for monitoring his cardiac function. In a follow-up visit 3 months later  he was asymptomatic with no complications.  III. Discussion: This case exemplifies the importance of early recognition and treatment of NVIE  particularly in patients with risk factors such as underlying heart disease or immunocompromised states. It highlights the significance of clinical signs such as Osler’s nodes and Janeway lesions  despite their rarity  in suspecting infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,94,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Sexagenarian Diabetic Female Patient  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian female residing in a suburban area in the United States. She is retired and living with her husband of 40 years. She has no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. The patient is independent and enjoys gardening as a hobby.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 25-year history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which she is taking daily doses of Metformin. She also has a history of hypertension which she manages with Lisinopril. There's no history of previous heart conditions in the patient's medical history. There is no history of illicit drug use or recent dental surgeries. Her last annual check-up was six months prior to admission and no significant issues were found at that time.  Presenting Complaints and Symptoms: The patient presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of a low-grade fever  extreme fatigue  loss of appetite  unintentional weight loss  and night sweats. Upon further probing  she also admitted to a recent onset of joint pains  which she attributed initially to her gardening activities.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  she appeared pale and fatigued. She had a temperature of 100.8°F  a heart rate of 90 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute  and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. There were no visible skin changes. Auscultation of the heart revealed a new onset  grade II/VI systolic atypical heart murmur and no other significant findings.  Investigations: Blood tests showed mild anemia and raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures were taken and she was started empirically on intravenous antibiotics. The cultures later identified Streptococcus viridans as the infectious organism  suggesting a likely diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a vegetative lesion on the mitral valve  hence confirming the diagnosis.  Treatment & Follow-Up: She was treated with tailored intravenous antibiotics  based on the blood culture and sensitivity reports for six weeks  maintaining rigorous blood sugar control to aid with the recovery process. Following treatment  her symptoms gradually improved.  Outcome: Despite her age and diabetic condition  she weathered through the infection well. A follow-up six months later with an echocardiogram showed a significant reduction in the size of the vegetation.  This case highlights the importance of considering native-valve infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis in older adults presenting with persistent low-grade fever  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss  especially in patients with a history of chronic diseases.

An electrocardiogram showed no ischemic changes. Chest x-ray demonstrated mild congestion.   Three sets of blood cultures were drawn and subsequently grown Streptococcus bovis. Transthoracic echocardiogram  followed by transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of vegetations on the tricuspid valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was commenced on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamycin following Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines. His course was complicated by septic pulmonary emboli  requiring extended antibiotic therapy.  Follow Up and Outcomes  The patient made a slow but steady recovery over ten weeks with resolution of the infection. Repeat echocardiography showed no residual valve damage  indicating a successful treatment response. He continues to be monitored for potential relapse.  Patient Perspective  The diagnosis and extended hospital stay was a stressful experience for the patient and his family. Psychosocial therapy was employed to help them cope.  Informed Consent  Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report. His identity has been protected.   Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis in elderly patients presenting with systemic inflammatory signs and new cardiac murmurs. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management can result in successful patient outcomes  even in the setting of severe infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,96,"Title: """"Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Hispanic Female: A Case Report""""  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE)  a risky and potentially life-threatening infection of the endocardium  primarily affects the heart valves. Those with native-valve IE have not had valve replacement surgery. This case study pertains to an elderly Hispanic female with native-valve infective endocarditis and the complexities of her diagnosis and treatment.  Case Description:  Patient Demographics: The patient is an 83-year-old  Hispanic Female  retired school teacher  devoted Catholic and resident of Brownsville  Texas.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  non-insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and previous breast cancer  for which she had undergone a mastectomy 20 years earlier.   Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the ER with complaints of fatigue  intermittent fever  loss of appetite  progressive shortness of breath on exertion and disturbing weight loss over the past two months. She also exhibited symptoms like mild confusion and night sweats.  Clinical Findings: Clinicians found her vitals at presentation to be slightly unstable: BP was 140/90 mmHg  pulse 105 bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths per min  and temperature 100.4°F. On physical examination  the patient exhibited pallor. A cardiac exam revealed a new 3/6 systolic murmur. While skin examination showed no signs of Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions  or splinter hemorrhages  funduscopic examination revealed Roth's spots.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood cultures were drawn and she underwent an echocardiogram which showed vegetations on the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation confirming the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures later isolated Streptococcus viridans. This  along with the new murmur and fever confirmed the diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous Penicillin G and Gentamicin  following the AHA/ACC guidelines for subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans. The patient was monitored for complications including heart failure  valve rupture  and embolization.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Over the next two weeks  the patient's condition stabilized. She showed an overall improvement  and her weights indicated that she was regaining lost weight. Six-weeks post-initiation of treatment  the patient was deemed stable enough for discharge with oral antibiotics and a follow-up echocardiogram scheduled for three months.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the necessity of a high index of suspicion when older patients present with nonspecific symptoms including fatigue  fever  and unexplained weight loss  especially in those with preexisting heart conditions. The patient’s age and underlying hypertension may have contributed to her relatively poor condition on presentation  leading to a more complex diagnostic and treatment procedure for NVIE. "
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,97,Title: Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 54-year-old Caucasian Male   Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE)  particularly native-valve infective endocarditis is a severe type of heart valve infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. This case report describes a patient with this condition  emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive management.  Case presentation: The patient was a 54-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was a former smoker (stopped ten years ago) and denied any illicit drug use. He presented to the emergency department with a five-day history of intermittent  high-grade fever accompanied by chills  malaise  night sweats  and a 3 kg weight loss over the past month. There was no reported history of chest pain  cough  shortness of breath  or orthopnea. The patient's previous echocardiography for hypertension monitoring  conducted six months ago  detected no signs of valvular disease.  On examination  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5 °C  a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Except for a faint heart murmur  physical inspection and systemic examinations were largely unremarkable. However  infectious disease signs such as Osler's nodes  Roth spots  or Janeway lesions were absent.  Labs drawn indicated moderate leukocytosis with left shift  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and C-reactive protein. Blood cultures grew viridans group streptococci  which was susceptible to penicillin. The chest X-ray was within normal limits  whereas the transesophageal echocardiogram revealed large  oscillating vegetation on the aortic valve consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Strategy: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin as per the American Heart Association guidelines for native-valve infective endocarditis due to streptococci. In spite of aggressive antibiotic therapy  the patient showed no clinical improvement after seven days  and the vegetation size remained unchanged on follow-up echocardiography. Therefore  the decision for early surgical intervention was taken. The patient subsequently underwent a successful aortic valve replacement with a prosthetic valve  followed by a six-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone.  Outcome: Postoperative course was uneventful. The patient showed marked clinical improvement  was afebrile  and had stabilized cardiac function. At the two-month follow-up visit  the patient remained asymptomatic  with the prosthetic valve functioning optimally on echocardiography.  Discussion: This case highlights the salient features and complexities associated with the management of native-valve infective endocarditis. Despite being a less common form of infective endocarditis  early recognition paired with aggressive medical and  if necessary  surgical intervention is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,98,Title: A Case Report of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Hispanic Female With History of Intravenous Drug Use   Patient Information  A 55-year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency room with a week-long history of fatigue  chills  intermittent fevers  and loss of appetite. She has a past medical history of chronic hepatitis C  frequent intravenous drug use  and is a nonsmoker. She reported no allergies and is not on any routine medications.   Clinical findings   The patient was noted to be febrile (38.5°C) and had tachycardia (110 bpm) upon physical examination. She appeared generally unwell with mild jaundice. Physical examination also revealed subtle Janeway lesions on the palms of her hands. Cardiac examination demonstrated an early diastolic murmur best heard in the left third intercostal space. Chest auscultation revealed clear and equal air entry  and examination of her abdomen was unremarkable. She had poor dental hygiene but no obvious dental abscesses.   Diagnostic Assessment  Blood tests showed elevated white cell counts (15 000/mm^3)  C-reactive protein (CRP) of 180 mg/L  and mildly elevated liver enzymes. She tested positive for HCV. Chest radiography was clear with no evident signs of pneumonia or pulmonary emboli.   Two sets of blood cultures were taken from different sites at 12 hours apart before starting antibiotics. Both turned positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis based on the combination of her clinical findings and positive blood cultures.   A transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a large vegetation on the anterior leaflet of mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was started on IV vancomycin and gentamicin in the emergency department after collecting blood cultures. After diagnosis confirmation  she was continued on the antibiotics regimen for six weeks as per guidelines for S. aureus endocarditis. She was also counseled extensively on the harmful effects of intravenous drug use  and she was referred to a drug rehab program.  Follow-Up and Outcomes  The patient showed improvement after two weeks of antibiotics with normalized temperature and no signs of heart failure. Repeat blood cultures at week 2 and at the end of therapy were negative. Post-treatment transthoracic echocardiogram showed smaller vegetation size and less severe mitral regurgitation. Following the successful completion of antibiotic therapy  she was recommended for interval dental care and regular medical follow-up for hepatitis C management.  Teaching Point  This case highlights the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients with intravenous drug use presenting with prolonged fever. Early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic therapy are crucial to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. It also underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approach involving addiction medicine.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,99,Title: Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis Presenting as a Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Mr. JH  a 48-year-old African-American male with a past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension  presented to the hospital with a two-week history of progressively worsening lethargy  lower limb edema  and weight gain.  Presenting Complaint: His primary complaints were episodes of dyspnea that emerged two days prior to admission and became worse over time and fatigue with a recent onset of lower limb swelling.  Medical  Surgical  and Family History: His past medical history reveals a 10-year history of well-regulated hypertension via the use of amlodipine. Previously  he had no surgeries or known allergy issues. His family history was germane for father and brother suffering from end-stage renal disease correlated with unidentified glomerulopathies.  Examination/Investigations: JH was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left fifth intercostal space. Respiratory examination found bilateral basal crackles. Lower limb pitting edema was noticed as well. Despite these findings  the patient appeared to be in no distress.   Lab findings upon admission included creatinine - 3.2 mg/dl  hemoglobin - 10.1 g/dL  and a urine analysis demonstrated proteinuria (3+) and hematuria. His electrocardiogram and Chest X-ray were normal. An echocardiogram revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the ventricular side of the anterior mitral leaflet  consistent with a vegetation (0.8 x 0.5 cm).  Treatment: JH was admitted under the preliminary diagnosis of nephritic syndrome associated with infective endocarditis. The clinical team initiated empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone  whilst blood cultures were sent.  Cultures and histopathology: Blood cultures grew Streptococcus oralis  a viridans group streptococcus. Renal biopsy revealed ‘lumpy-bumpy’ sub-epithelial deposits indicative of immune complex-associated pathology - focal endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis.   Outcome: JH was treated with a six-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone to target the isolated streptococcus species. Over the next weeks  his fluid overload and hypertension were managed with diuretics and ramipril. At the completion of his treatment  his renal function had improved  but still impaired (creatinine - 1.9 mg/dl). Long-term follow-up arrangements were made with both the Cardiovascular and Renal outpatient services  along with plans for repeat echocardiography.  Discussion: This case report highlights membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis presenting as a case of native-valve infective endocarditis - an interesting intersection of nephrology and cardiology in clinical practice. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,7,100,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  commonly occurring in the heart's valves. Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) involves infection of normal  previously undamaged heart valves. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment  IE remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is an 78-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired school teacher  hailing from a suburban area. He lives with his wife and maintains an active lifestyle.  Chief complaints: The patient presented at our healthcare facility with complaints of persistent low-grade fever  chills  malaise  and unexplained weight loss over the last three weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both well-controlled with medication. He had no history of intravenous drug use  prior valve disease  or congenital heart abnormalities. There was no known history of dentistry-associated IE. His family history was non-contributory.  Clinical Findings: On physical exam  the patient appeared lethargic and moderately ill. His vital signs included a low-grade fever  heart rate of 96 beats per minute  blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg  and respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur along left sternal border. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Blood cultures were drawn  which eventually grew Streptococcus viridans  a common causative agent of NVIE. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  which showed a vegetation on the mitral valve  consistent with NVIE.    Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was admitted and promptly started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous penicillin and gentamicin. After the positive blood culture results  treatment was de-escalated to targeted therapy with intravenous penicillin for six weeks considered effective for Streptococcus viridans.   Follow-up: The patient showed steady improvement with the treatment regime. His fever subsided  and general well-being improved. Repeat blood cultures drawn after a week of therapy were negative. After six weeks  a follow-up echocardiogram showed resolved vegetation.   Discussion: NVIE is a severe condition that requires prompt recognition and aggressive management. This case underscores the importance of taking a thorough history and maintaining a high index of suspicion for NVIE  especially in older patients with nonspecific symptoms.  Patient Perspective: The patient was relieved with the diagnosis  progress  and outcome of his condition. He was thankful for the comprehensive care received at the health facility.   Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes that NVIE  although less common in the modern antibiotic era  should always be included in the differential diagnosis when an older patient presents with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained fever  fatigue  and weight loss along with clinical signs of valvular disease. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the patient's prognosis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,1,"Chief Complaint:  """"Shortness of breath and intermittent fevers""""  Patient Description: The patient  Mr. X  is a 63-year-old African American male from the urban North-East USA. He was brought to the emergency department with complaints of breathlessness and intermittent high-grade fever for the past two weeks. The patient also endorsed experiencing a decreased appetite  unintentional weight loss  and nights sweats.   Past Medical History: Mr. X has known hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 7 years ago. Both conditions have not been well-controlled  primarily due to medication non-adherence. Additionally  there is a history of I.V. drug abuse in his past  but he has been clean for the past 15 years. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.  Family History: His mother died at 68 due to a stroke  and his father passed away at 66 due to complications of lung cancer. The patient has two brothers; one has hypertension while the other is healthy.  Social History: He is currently unemployed  living on his own with no family support. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and has mild  occasional alcohol consumption.   Examination Details: The clinical examination revealed poor dentition  fever (38.9°C)  tachypnea  a heart murmur  and splinter hemorrhages under the fingernails. His BP was 150/90 mm Hg  pulse rate 110/min  respiratory rate 22/min  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Otherwise  his systemic examination was unremarkable.  Clinical Course and Diagnoses: Considering fever  heart murmur  weight loss  the patient's poor dentition and history of I.V. drug abuse in past  suspecting subacute bacterial endocarditis. Blood cultures were sent and he was started empirically on intravenous antibiotics. His echocardiogram showed vegetation on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Diagnosis: Based on clinical findings  blood culture results  and echocardiography  the patient was confirmed to have native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Follow-up: The patient was admitted to the hospital and a treatment plan for infective endocarditis was instituted per the IDSA guidelines. His chronic hypertension and diabetes were also managed in the hospital. The patient was enrolled in a smoking cessation program and a consultation with a social worker was arranged for housing and social support. Outpatient follow-up after discharge was scheduled for the assessment of response to treatment  and to continue managing his chronic conditions. "
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,2,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 60 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Birthplace: USA Residence: Urban area  medium socio-economic status Occupation: Retired engineer Family History: Both parents diagnosed with heart disease. Elder brother died from a stroke. Younger sister has type 2 diabetes.  Case Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 60-year old African American male was admitted to the hospital complaining of experiencing fever  fatigue  and a persistent cough over the past 3 weeks. His symptoms were accompanied by a loss of appetite leading to unintentional weight loss. He mentioned intermittent dull chest pain but denied any shortness of breath. On physical examination  there were signs of mild pallor and evidence of splenomegaly.  From his medical history  it was found that Mr. Doe was diagnosed with a mitral valve prolapse 20 years ago but remained asymptomatic. He is also hypertensive and has been on medication for past 15 years. Mr. Doe disclosed that he had dental extraction 2 months ago. He quit smoking a decade ago and maintains a history of moderate alcohol use.  His blood results revealed anemia of chronic disease  a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response. In addition  persistent bacteremia was revealed in blood cultures indicating an infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed due to his history of mitral valve prolapse and symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. The TTE confirmed vegetation on his mitral valve  leading to a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion:  Native-Valve infective endocarditis is a serious condition. In Mr. Doe's case  his previous history of mitral valve prolapse  age  regular alcohol consumption and invasive dental procedure possibly contributed to the increased risk of developing this disease. Given his symptoms  inflammatory indicators and TTE results  a prompt treatment plan is required to avoid further complications such as heart failure  systemic embolism  damage to the infected valve  or septicemia. Antibiotic therapy will likely be initiated  tailored to the organism found in blood culture results.  The scenario illustrates the importance of comprehensive history taking and appropriate diagnostic tests for patients presenting with vague symptoms. Especially  patients with pre-existing conditions like valvular heart diseases should be closely monitored  educated about the risks  and should be advised prophylactic measures during invasive procedures  including dental work. A collaboration between primary care physicians  cardiologists  infectious disease specialists and microbiologists remains pivotal in managing such cases.   The case also reinforces the role of sociodemographic factors in disease prevalence  emphasizing the value of continued research into the influence of race  age  and socio-economic status to ensure equitable care for all patients.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,3,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer  with a past medical history of symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to heart failure  diabetes mellitus type II  and hypertension. He is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic and has a family history of cardiovascular disorders  particularly on the maternal side. His mother passed away at the age of 67 due to a myocardial infarction  and an elder sibling is currently managed with medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Current Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented in the ER describing a two-week history of recurrent fevers  fatigue  and a notable weight loss of approximately 5 kg within the last month. He also complained of experiencing night sweats and shortness of breath  particularly with exertion. Upon admission  he was febrile  with a temperature of 101.5 F. Physical examination indicated a new systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and visible Janeway lesions on the palms and soles.  Investigations:  Initial blood work revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15.0 x 10^9/L and C-reactive protein of 180 mg/L  indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Blood cultures were drawn and sent to the lab. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetations on the mitral valve indicating endocarditis. Blood cultures subsequently grew Staphylococcus aureus  sensitive to flucloxacillin  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous flucloxacillin in line with the culture sensitivity results. He was also referred to the cardiovascular surgical team for consideration for valvular surgery  due to the considerable size of the vegetations discovered on echocardiogram.  Summary:  The patient's comorbidities such as heart failure  diabetes mellitus II  and hypertension potentially contributed to the development of native-valve infective endocarditis as they are proven risk factors. The presence of symptoms such as fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and shortness of breath  combined with physical findings and laboratory results  helped establish the diagnosis. The positive growth of Staphylococcus aureus from blood culture samples confirmed the diagnosis and determined the appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's case is cooperative to the findings in the literature  as Caucasian males above the age 60  particularly with a history of heart disease  constitute a significant proportion of reported infective endocarditis cases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,4,Patient Introduction: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Robert Smith  residing in the urban area of Philadelphia  PA. He is financially comfortable and has lived a fairly sedentary lifestyle due to his work as a software engineer. He is an active smoker with a 30-pack year history and a routine moderate alcohol consumer. He has an extensive family history of heart diseases  with both his father and grandfather dying of myocardial infarctions in their late 60s.  Presenting Complaint: Robert was admitted to the hospital presenting with a two-week history of low-grade fever  night sweats  weight loss  and increasing fatigue. Recently  he has also experienced shortness of breath on exertion and a visible decrease in appetite.   Medical History: Robert has a known history of Type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are well-managed with medication (metformin and atorvastatin  respectively). However  he has struggled with consistent management of these conditions due to his sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. His only surgical history is a hernia repair 10 years ago.   Clinical Findings and Relevant Test Results: In the emergency department  Robert was febrile with temperature of 100.8°F and exhibited signs of mild heart failure (bilateral ankle edema  elevated jugular venous pressure). An initial cardiac examination revealed a new-onset murmur detected on the left sternal border. Blood tests showed elevated CRP and ESR  indicating systemic inflammation.   Three sets of blood cultures were taken  all which eventually grew Staphylococcus aureus  implicating bacterial endocarditis. An ECG was ordered to investigate further  revealing some ST-segment changes consistent with ischemia.   Following these results  a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed which showed a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.   Management and Discussion: Given the blood culture results  the patient was started on empiric antibiotic treatment with intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin. An infectious disease consult was requested for the best antibiotic treatment regimen going forward. Cardiology consult was called for discussion of need for possible surgical intervention  considering the extent of valve damage on the echocardiogram  along with the patient's future quality of life.  Although Robert's daily lifestyle and comorbidities related to diabetes and hypercholesterolemia are considered risk factors for heart disease  they are not traditional risk factors for infective endocarditis. It is more frequently found among individuals with a history of IV drug use  the presence of a prosthetic heart valve or congenital heart disease. As it stands  Robert's case represents a somewhat atypical presentation of native valve endocarditis in a patient without classic risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,5,Patient Case  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. J  who lives within a long-term healthcare facility due to his physical inability to live independently. The patient has not been a smoker  drug or alcohol user. He is retired and used to work as a construction worker  up until about 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis  which now confines him to a wheelchair.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past history of rheumatoid arthritis  for which he takes methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor. He also has a history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril and atherosclerosis. His BMI is 30  being overweight  and is previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes  controlled with Metformin. He also had a past kidney infection treated with antibiotics and has chronic lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia and is managed with Tamsulosin.  Family History: His mother died at age 75 due to myocardial infarction  and his father died at 74 due to a stroke. He also has one brother who is 67  diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and hypertension.  Chief Complaint: Mr. J presented symptoms that included continuous high fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and swollen feet.   Diagnosis:  After extensive evaluation with blood tests  complete body check-up  transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)  and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE)  the Rheumatoid arthritis presence in his body and typical clinical features such as fever  positive blood cultures  and echocardiographic evidence suggested that Mr. J had native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment: The patient was treated with appropriate antibiotics to combat the endocarditis. Efforts have also been made to improve his nutritional health and increase his immunity in order to avoid future complications. Furthermore  physical and occupational therapy were initiated to improve his mobility  and the medical team have considered the possible need for surgical intervention  given his persistent infection.  This case underscores the importance of a holistic patient assessment for successfully diagnosing and managing complex diseases like native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly considering factors like chronic rheumatoid arthritis  which might predispose an individual to this condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,6,Patient Overview:  Patient Initials: J.K Age: 57 Sex: Female Race: African American  Past Medical History: J.K is a 57-year-old African-American woman diagnosed about 20 years ago with Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She's managed her conditions with oral hypoglycemic agents  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  diet control  and exercise. She has a 10-pack a year history of smoking but quit over 15 years ago. She had an episode of acute pyelonephritis five years ago that required hospitalization and IV antibiotics.  Presenting Problem: J.K presents at the emergency department (ED) with chief complaints of intermittent high-grade fever  night sweats  fatigue  unintentional weight loss (about 6 kg in 3 months)  and a recent onset of shortness of breath.  Investigations: On examination  the physician detects a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur in the mitral area  suggestive of possible mitral regurgitation. Temperature of 38.3°C  pulse 92/min  blood pressure 130/76 mmHg  respiratory rate 18/min. Routine blood examination reveals leukocytosis (WBC count: 18 000/mm3 - neutrophils 82%). There is also elevated CRP and ESR showing signs of inflammation.   Echocardiography reveals a vegetation of size 1.5 cm X 0.5 cm on the posterior leaflet of her mitral valve and mild mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures drawn at the ED later reveal the growth of Streptococcus viridans  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Social History: She is a retired elementary school teacher who lives with her husband of 32 years. She has two adult children who live out of state. She denies any drug or alcohol abuse.  Family History: Her mother died of a stroke at age 75  and her father died of congestive heart failure at 80. She has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and cardiovascular disease in the family.   Discussion: J.K's diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is less common among African American adults than whites (Fowler et al.  2005). Risk factors relating to J.K's case include her age (most patients are over 50 years old)  existing valvular disease  and being female as she falls under the lower risk group (Bor et al.  2013).   Her history of dental work may have led to transient bacteremia  with S. viridans as the causative organism  a common feature seen in native-valve endocarditis. Her diabetes could also have contributed to her susceptibility to infection. She will require prolonged antibiotic therapy together with a close follow-up to monitor her response to treatment and cardiac function.  Citations: Bor  D. H.  Woolhandler  S.  Nardin  R.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,7,Patient Profile: Mr. James  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He was born and raised in a suburban area and worked as an accountant for 35 years. He retired two years ago and has since been used to a sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. James presented with symptoms of high fever above 101.3℉  fatigue  night sweats  chill  and weight loss over the last three weeks. He also complained of shortness of breath during normal daily activities.  Past Medical History: Mr. James has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for the last ten years. He has a history of hypertension  controlled with medications. He is also a former smoker and quit 15 years ago.  Family History: Mr. James has a family history of coronary artery disease. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 56. There is no family history of valvular heart disease or rheumatic fever.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis: Tests indicated anemia and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Echocardiography confirmed the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve and moderate mitral regurgitation consistent with a diagnosis of native valve endocarditis. Blood cultures were positive  confirming infective endocarditis.  Management: Mr. James was hospitalized immediately and empirical antibiotic therapy was started before obtaining the blood culture and sensitivity tests. His regimen consisted of intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. A cardiologist recommended continuing conservative medical management. Routine monitoring of his blood sugar levels and blood pressure was ordered. Dietician advice for a diabetic and cardiac-friendly diet was also initiated.  Prognosis: Given Mr. James's pre-existing conditions  his prognosis was guarded. He was informed of the potential complications  including heart failure  stroke  and the potential need for valve replacement surgery if the heart function worsens.  In conclusion  Mr. James' case presents a common scenario of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis  complicated by advanced age  diabetes  and high blood pressure  contributing factors towards a more aggressive clinical progression. His case necessitates assertive treatment and frequent follow-ups.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,8,Patient Initials: RS                   Age: 66                          Sex: Male                            Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint: High fever  fatigue  night sweats  and shortness of breath.  Present Illness: The patient presented with a two-week history of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  shortness of breath and night sweats. He also reported a recent dental procedure about a month ago.  Past Medical History: RS is a known case of rheumatic heart disease and has been on medication for the past 20 years. Additionally  he also suffers from hypertension which is well-controlled with medication. He does not have any history of diabetes or any other chronic illnesses including malignancies. He was hospitalized 2 years ago for a mild stroke from which he recovered fully.  Family History: Both his parents suffered from cardiovascular diseases. His father died from a heart attack and his mother from stroke. No history of genetic disorders.  Social History: He is a retired engineer  married with two children. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He is quite active despite his age and often engages in light physical activities like walking.  Physical Examination: The examination revealed a high grade fever (39.5°C)  blood pressure of 135/85mmHg  heartbeat irregular at 85 bpm. His heart auscultation informs a regurgitant murmur. His lungs were clear and all other system examinations were unremarkable  and he showed no obvious signs of heart failure. He was alert and oriented  with normal speech and no apparent neurological deficits.  Laboratory findings: Blood test results showed elevated WBC count and ESR  indicating ongoing inflammation. His haemoglobin and platelet levels were normal while the liver and kidney function tests were slightly deranged.  Echo-cardiogram and chest X-ray findings: Echocardiography demonstrated large mobile vegetations on the native aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Intervention: Intravenous antibiotics were administered as per hospital guidelines considering bacterial endocarditis. Due to the valve damage  the patient was recommended for surgical aortic valve replacement due to the presence of large vegetations and regurgitating valve.  This case of RS highlights that even with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease  one must be vigilant to recognize and diagnose a case of native valve infective endocarditis  especially after dental procedures which are known risk factors. Early antibiotic administration with necessary surgical intervention can significantly improve the prognosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,9,Patient Presentation:  Mr. X is a 65-year-old African American male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Mr. X who resides in a semi-urban region of New York  presented to the hospital with complaints of persistent fever  chills  fatigue  and a loss of appetite. He has been experiencing these symptoms intermittently for about six weeks.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and hypertensive disease  which are well controlled by Metformin 500 mg twice daily and Lisinopril 20 mg once a day respectively. He was also diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his early 30s and had been on Amoxicillin prophylaxis until 5 years ago  after which it was discontinued due to repeated allergic reactions. He has no known drug allergies except Amoxicillin. He quit smoking 10 years ago and has a moderate intake of wine. Mr. X is compliant with his medications but his compliance to lifestyle modifications is inconsistent.  Family History:  Mr. X's father had Coronary Artery Disease and Type II Diabetes Mellitus. His paternal grandfather expired due to a stroke at a relatively elder age while his mother and one sibling are living and well. There's no significant family history of valvular heart diseases  infectious diseases or autoimmune diseases.  Clinical Examination:  On the day of admission  Mr. X exhibited a heart murmur confirmed by auscultation  and his vitals showed a mild tachycardia. He had Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  Osler nodes on his fingers  and mild splenomegaly. Blood work showed mild anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and a patient's white blood cell count was normal.   Laboratory Investigations:  Blood culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus Viridans. Echocardiography showed abnormalities of the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.   Summation:  Mr. X is a 65-year-old African American male with a complex medical history of rheumatic heart disease  hypertension  diabetes  coming from an at-risk community. He presented with persistent fever  fatigue  Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  and a positive blood culture resulting in a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis most likely attributable to the untreated rheumatic heart disease. The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and the cessation of prophylaxis against Streptococcal infections put him at a high risk of developing bacterial endocarditis.   This case underlines the importance of continuation of prophylaxis in patients at risk for endocarditis  the role of regular clinical follow-ups  and the necessity of detailed education about the importance of their medication regimen to such patients.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,10,Patient Profile and Presentation: Mr. Smith is a 58-year-old Caucasian male who has been admitted to the hospital due to severe shortness of breath  weakness  and chest pain. He has a history of intravenous drug abuse but has been sober for about five years. Additionally  he has a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease and has undergone heart valve replacement surgery fifteen years ago.  Social History: Mr. Smith is a former construction worker  currently unemployed  living in a suburban setting averaging low socioeconomic status. He lives alone  is divorced  and has two daughters who live out of state. He has a 35-pack year smoking history but quit five years ago. His diet is low in fruit and vegetables and high in processed  fatty foods.  Family History: Both parents succumbed to cardiovascular diseases in their late sixties. His father had a history of ischemic heart disease  while his mother had a cerebral vascular accident. One paternal uncle had stomach cancer  while another had Parkinson's disease. There is no other significant family history.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  Mr. Smith appeared anxious and diaphoretic with a heart rate of 120 beats/min  blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. His cardiovascular examination revealed a high-pitched  blowing  diastolic  and decrescendo murmur heard at the left third intercostal space along the sternum  suggesting aortic regurgitation. Laboratory reports showed elevated ESR  CRP  and white cell count. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  and the transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed vegetation on aortic valve  aligning with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Treatment and Prognosis: Mr. Smith was immediately started on empiric antibiotic therapy  using a combination of intravenous Penicillin G and Gentamicin  following the AHA guidelines for native valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. The medical team is seeing a modest improvement in his condition. However  his prognosis remains uncertain due to his prior medical condition and his socioeconomic circumstances  including limited access to regular healthcare and poor dietary patterns.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis  although rare  is a severe condition and remains a substantial contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  particularly in patients with previous heart valve surgery or a history of intravenous drug abuse. Timely diagnosis and prompt antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone for managing infective endocarditis. Further  the case emphasizes the importance of providing adequate outpatient resources for patients with poor socioeconomic backgrounds to prevent disease relapse or complications.   This presentation was created following standard demographic representation as found in related literature  and does not aim to stereotype or overgeneralize any population groups.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,11,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. Miller Age: 63 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retiring electrician  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Miller presents at the clinic with persistent  high-grade fever for the past three weeks. He is also complaining of fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and occasional breathlessness.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Miller has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension  both of which are well-controlled with medications. He is also a former smoker for 40 years but has quit for 10 years now.  Family History:  His father had a Mike's murmur which was treated successfully and his mother passed away due to complications related to heart failure. His only sibling  an older brother  has a history of rheumatoid arthritis.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. Miller appeared generally unwell and was diaphoretic. He was febrile with a temperature of 38.6°C. Cardiac examination revealed a new murmur on the left sternal edge  grade 2/6  during diastole. No signs of Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  or Roth spots were observed. His BMI indicated overweight status.  Laboratory Findings:  Blood test results confirmed a raised white cell count and high C-reactive protein  signaling an infection. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram revealed a mobile mass on the native aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation  confirming infective endocarditis. Blood cultures were also positive for Streptococcus viridans  common in native-valve infective endocarditis which is usually found in the mouth.   Summary:  Mr. Miller  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension  presents with a 3-week history of high-grade fever  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and occasional breathlessness. Physical examination and confirmatory lab investigations indicated a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.    Treatment Plan:  Mr. Miller was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring. His treatment regimen includes intravenous antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin  to be used synergistically for at least 4-6 weeks. Surgery may be necessitated if conditions escalate. Regular follow-ups are scheduled for monitoring the patient's response to the treatment.   Prediction/Prognosis:  The prognosis in Mr. Miller's case is cautious  given his age and already compromised health condition. However  with intense antibiotic treatment and potential surgical intervention  the possibility of clinical improvement is feasible.  Educational Needs of Patient/Family:  Education about the importance of strict dental hygiene will be provided  given that Streptococcus viridans  causing IE  is generally found in the mouth. Further  the patient and family will be educated about the signs and symptoms of endocarditis exacerbation  teaching them when to seek immediate medical attention. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,12,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a History of Intravenous Drug Use  I. Introduction: The patient  Mr. S.  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male from the urban Midwest with a past medical history of intravenous drug use  type II diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. He was admitted to the Emergency Department  presenting with symptoms of chronic fatigue  visual disturbance  and fever that have progressively worsened in the past week.  II. Family History and Social History: The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father dying of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. His mother  88  is alive and suffers from osteoporosis and hypertension. Mr. S. is a retired construction worker and divorced. He has a sociocultural background indicative of low socioeconomic status and has a habit of cigarette smoking and former intravenous heroin abuse. He reported being clean for the past five years.  III. Presenting Concerns:  On admission  Mr. S.'s temperature was 38.6°C (101.5°F)  blood pressure was 136/85 mmHg  pulse rate was at 92 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. He was noted to have poor dental hygiene and findings consistent with peripheral manifestations of endocarditis  including Osler's nodes  splinter hemorrhages  and Janeway lesions.  IV. Diagnosis:  Examination and investigations  including three sets of blood cultures  chest X-ray  and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)  were conducted. The blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus and TEE revealed the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  V. Treatment and Prognosis:  Mr. S. was treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy targeted at the identified organism. Given his history of substance use and poor dental hygiene  his risks are significantly heightened for recurrence. Upon discharge  he was advised regular dental check-ups  strict control of his diabetes  and to maintain his sobriety  in light of his high-risk status for recurrent endocarditis. His prognosis  while guarded due to the previous damage done to the cardiac tissues and vessels through prolonged drug abuse  is fair with adherence to proper management.  VI. Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering native-valve infective endocarditis in older patients with a history of intravenous drug use who present with seemingly nonspecific symptoms. Recognizing the signs of this condition amidst various presentations can prompt timely diagnosis and treatment  better affecting patient outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,13,Patient Presentation:  Patient X is a 65-year-old African American male  currently residing in Brooklyn  New York. He has been a smoker for the past 35 years and is still active. He often consumes alcohol but it is within reasonable limits. He is unmarried  retired  lives alone  and has two adult children who live separately.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  managed by diet restriction  regular exercise and oral antihypertensives for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage III five years ago. As far as oral health is concerned  the patient has neglected his dental hygiene and has missing teeth and gum disease.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. X came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of recurrent fever  chills  malaise  and a new heart murmur which was discovered through clinical examination. He hasn't reported any recent travels or exposure to infectious diseases. His temperature at the time of admission was 39.4°C.  Investigations:  Routine labs revealed anemia (hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dl) and a raised white cell count of 18 000/microL with 80% neutrophils. His ESR was also high at 90 mm/hr. The patient X's renal function tests were impaired with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment:  On diagnosis  he was started on appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy: naficillin and gentamicin. Procedure for mitral valve replacement was discussed with him and his next of kin considering the severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure symptoms.  Family history:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his mother suffered from hypertension and passed away due to stroke at the age of 72. His older brother  aged 68  has been managing coronary artery disease for ten years. His two children are reported to be healthy.  Given his history of poor oral health  smoking  diabetes  and CKD  he is at an increased risk for native valve infective endocarditis. This case underscores the importance of the consideration of endocarditis in patients presenting with fevers of unknown origin  especially in those with risk factors such as poor dental hygiene and underlying heart conditions. It is also essential to educate such patients about oral hygiene and regular dental checkups in an attempt to prevent endocarditis.  In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of infective endocarditis in a patient with predisposing factors presenting with unexplained fever. Early diagnosis and management can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,14,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian Male from urban Missouri. He is a retired construction worker  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He has recently been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also has a history of smoking one pack a day for the past 40 years  though he quit two years ago.  Family History: The patient has a family history of heart disease  with his father dying from a myocardial infarction in his late 60s and his mother diagnosed with heart valve disease. His older brother has hypertension.  Presenting Complaint and Symptoms: The patient presented with a persistent high-grade fever of 101.2 F  sweating  shortness of breath  persistent cough  weight loss  and fatigue.   Clinical Examination and Findings: On clinical examination  the patient had a regular heart rate but a noticeable heart murmur was heard on auscultation. He was pale  with Janeway lesions observed on both palms and soles  and Osler nodes on fingers tips  indicating a systemic embolism.   Investigations: Blood tests showed an elevated white cell count and ESR  reinforcing a suspicion of infection. Keeping in line with his recent diagnosis  echocardiography revealed vegetation on the mitral valve of his heart. Multiple blood cultures yielded positive results for Staphylococcus aureus  which is a common organism associated with infective endocarditis.  Management and Treatment: The patient was admitted to hospital and was treated with IV antibiotics (vancomycin)  as per the recommended protocol. His blood glucose levels and COPD were managed alongside. After several weeks of treatment  the patient showed substantial improvement.   Discussion: In this patient  his history of diabetes and smoking  alongside his family history of heart disease  may have predisposed him to increased risk for native-valve infective endocarditis. Diabetes has been associated with increased risk of infection  which could account for his development of endocarditis. Moreover  smoking can cause harm to one's oral health and lung function  potentially heightening risks of infections like endocarditis.  In terms of demographics  infective endocarditis typically occurs in older individuals aged 60-70  and more often in men. This aligns with the profile of our patient. Additionally  his occupation exposure (construction) may have put him at risk for developing such infections through repeated exposure to harmful dust or bacteria.  In conclusion  this case reflects the potential complexities associated with managing a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis and co-existing conditions  emphasizing the importance of personalized patient care and monitoring in order to optimize successful treatment outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,15,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the clinic with a four-week history of intermittent fever and one-week history of progressive fatigue. He has also experienced a loss of appetite and 5-pound weight loss over the last 30 weeks. He categorically denies any chest pain  cough  dysuria  or nocturia. He has never smoked and reports only occasional alcohol use. His only drug medication is aspirin (81mg daily)  which he has been taking since being diagnosed with hypertension seven years ago.  Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and Type-2 diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure has been well-controlled with amlodipine (5mg daily)  and his diabetes is managed primarily through diet and exercise  with metformin as needed. His most recent Hemoglobin A1c  taken six months ago  was 6.5%  and his blood pressure at the time of presentation was 140/80 mmHg.  Family History:  Mr. Rodriguez's family history is significant. His mother died at the age of 69 from a stroke  his older sister (70 years old) is living with cardiovascular disease and his father died at the age of 73 from complications related to Alzheimer’s disease.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. His heart sounds revealed a previously inaudible heart murmur  suggestive of a mitral regurgitation. He also had multiple non-tender  small  flat and red spots (petechiae) on his palms and soles.  Investigations:  Blood tests revealed an increased ESR and elevated C-reactive protein levels  suggestive of inflammation in his body. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram revealed a large oscillating mass attached to his atrial side of the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with a vegetation  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on Penicillin G and gentamicin  following the American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of Streptococci viridans-associated infective endocarditis. He responded well to the 4 weeks course and was discharged following betterment of symptoms and resolution of the vegetation on the follow-up echogram. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,16,Patient Profile:  GK is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  residing in Midwest  United States. He works as a machine operator and has a history of tobacco and alcohol use  which he quit approximately 10 years ago. He is married with three children and lives in a suburban setting. There is no family history of significant cardiovascular disease.  Chief Complaint:  GK presented to the emergency department with symptoms including fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and dyspnea.  Past Medical History:  GK was recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 and received uncontrolled management due to noncompliance. He failed to follow dietary recommendations and medication regimen prescribed by his healthcare provider. Besides type 2 diabetes  GK has a history of dental infections  for which he has received irregular treatment.  Physical Examination:  GK was febrile  with a higher heart rate of 100 beats per minute and elevated blood pressure of 148/96 mmHg. Examination detected a pan systolic murmur at the apex. His lower extremity had both pedal edema.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed leukocytosis (13x10⁹/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (87 mg/L). His hemoglobin was low (11.0 g/dl)  along with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 80mm/hr). Blood culture isolated a strain of viridans streptococci. Echocardiogram identified vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Hospital Course:  GK was admitted for intravenous antibiotic therapy as per guideline for native-valve streptococcal endocarditis. Despite initial improvement  his condition deteriorated due to the development of heart failure due to valve destruction. Surgical valve replacement was discussed with the patient.  Discussion:  GK’s diagnosis is consistent with the profile of patients at higher risk for native-valve infective endocarditis - those with diabetes  poor dental health  and older age. Additionally  as in this case  viridans streptococci  which originate from the oral cavity  are among the most common pathogens involved. A key feature of the case focuses on patient compliance  which is necessary for the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and prevention of endocarditic complications. Education to prompt regular dental care  adequate infection control  and compliance with medication regimen could limit the susceptibility to endocarditis.   By sharing this case  we aim to underline the importance of recognizing infective endocarditis's symptoms  understanding the importance of early diagnosis  prompt treatment  and the prevention measures that should be taken in susceptible individuals.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,17,Patient Summary:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female presenting with persistent fever  night sweats  and fatigue for the past three weeks. She was previously in her usual state of health until these symptoms started. She also notes a decreased appetite but denies chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  or weight loss. She currently works as a school teacher and denies any recent travel or risky behaviors.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with rheumatic fever during childhood  which resulted in long-term damage to her heart valves but not sufficiently severe to previously warrant any interventional approach such as surgery. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is under control with oral hypoglycemics. No history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions.  Family History: Her mother suffered from a stroke at the age of 65  and her father died at 70 due to complicated myocardial infarction (heart attack). She has two older siblings  both diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Social History: The patient is a lifetime non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. She has no known drug allergies and lives alone. According to her  she has no pets at home and has not been in contact with any sick individuals recently.  Course in the Hospital: Due to the patient's symptoms and her medical history of rheumatic fever and damaged heart valves  she was suspected of having infective endocarditis and immediately admitted to the cardiology department. Blood cultures were drawn  and empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. The resultant gram stain and culture revealed the presence of viridans group streptococci  which is a common organism associated with infective endocarditis  especially in people with pre-existing heart conditions. Transthoracic echocardiogram visualized oscillating intracardiac mass on a valve or supporting structures  or in the path of regurgitant jets  or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation.  Given these findings  along with her presenting symptoms and history  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Her condition was managed with a course of intravenous antibiotics. There was substantial improvement in her condition with defervescence  improving fatigue  and resolution of night sweats. She was scheduled for further follow-up and monitoring.  Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of detailed medical history and high clinical suspicion in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Early detection and intervention can reduce the high mortality associated with this condition. It also indicates the role of viridans group streptococci in the pathogenesis of native-valve endocarditis  especially in individuals with previous valve damage.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,18,Patient Presentation:  A 56-year-old African American male  Mr. X  presents at the emergency department complaining of unexplained weight loss  night sweats  fatigue  and persistent fever over the last two weeks. His past medical history is significant for intravenous drug use (IVDU)  untreated Hepatitis C  and hypertension. He has not been on regular treatment due to lack of consistent medical care. He lives alone and works inconsistently  mostly manual labor jobs.   Family History: No known history of heart diseases or infections but his father has Type 2 diabetes and his mother passed away from stroke at 60 years old.  Clinical Examination: On initial presentation  he appears fatigued and tired  his temperature is elevated at 38.5 degrees Celsius. The patient has a heart rate of 96 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 142/92mm Hg. Auscultation reveals a new-onset murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Skin inspection shows track marks indicative of IVDU and non-specific rashes.  Investigative Findings: Blood specimens collected for routine and microbiology tests shows significant leukocytosis and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a mobile mass on the tricuspid valve  suggestive of vegetation. Based on the clinical presentation  laboratory results  and echocardiographic findings  a diagnosis of the right-sided native valve infective endocarditis (IE) was made.   Discussion: Infective Endocarditis risk is disproportionately high in people with a history of IVDU  accounting for around 10 - 20% of all cases according to literature. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly isolated organism  as seen in our patient. Hypertension and untreated Hepatitis C of our patient may have made him more susceptible to the infection.  Management: He was started on an empirical treatment of intravenous antibiotics tailored to Staphylococcus aureus (nafcillin and gentamicin as per American Heart Association guidelines). Drug addiction counseling was suggested. The need for surgical intervention will depend on his response to antibiotics  but at this point  conservative management is preferred.  Overall  our patient's epidemiology  risk factors  and presentation align with the typical presentation of an individual at risk of native-valve infective endocarditis due to primary risk factor of a history of IVDU.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,19,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Davis is a 58-year-old African-American male with a medical history significant for moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  smoking  and a recently recovered pneumonia about 2 months ago. His social history indicates that he is a retired construction worker and lives alone  but has three adult children who stay nearby. He previously smoked one pack a day for the past 30 years  but quit smoking around a year ago. He doesn't consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. Mr. Davis is not on any chronic medications and has no known family history of heart diseases or any other genetic disorders.  Mr. Davis presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of high-grade fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and weight loss. He also reported a recent loss of appetite with associated discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Physical examination revealed mild pallor  clubbing  reduced breath sounds at the right lung base  and a subtly changing heart murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. There were no evident peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis.  Investigations:  Laboratory tests were significant for anemia (Hb = 10.2 g/dl)  neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count = 15 000/µL  75% neutrophils)  and mildly elevated liver enzymes. The cardiac markers were not elevated. Three sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  and Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet with mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis and Plan:  Mr. Davis was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  secondary to S. viridans infection. The suspicion is that his previous pneumonia incident may have allowed the bacteria to gain access to the bloodstream.   He was started on an appropriate antibiotic regimen  including IV Penicillin G and Gentamicin for synergistic effect  according to the current guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  2015. Patient education was also provided about the cardiac disease and endocarditis prevention  including good oral hygiene.  Mortality in infective endocarditis is high  in spite of the latest advancements in diagnosis and treatment. The prognosis in Mr. Davis's case will be influenced by his age  delayed diagnosis  the pathogen involved  presence of comorbid diseases like COPD  and the effective response to the treatment given. Regular follow-up and long-term monitoring are recommended to watch for complications  including congestive heart failure and embolic events.

History of Present Illness: Mrs. Johnson has been experiencing persistent fever for the past two weeks  ranging from 101-103°F  associated with chills. She has also complained of fatigue and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 pounds in the past month. Recently  she's had episodes of shortness of breath  particularly when she's climbing stairs or doing some strenuous activity.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2  approximately 10 years ago. She is being treated with Metformin and regularly monitors her blood sugar at home. She was diagnosed with hypertension five years back; treatment includes Lisinopril.   Current Medications: Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension.   Social History: She has a history of smoking a pack a day for the past 30 years  but quit smoking 10 years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally.  Family History: Father died of a heart attack at age 60. Mother had hypertension and died at 75 from stroke  and the patient’s younger sister is also diabetic.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mrs. Johnson appeared uncomfortable and had a heart rate of 95 beats/minute. On auscultation  a new heart murmur was detected. The patient had Janeway lesions on her palms and soles and Osler nodes were found in her fingertips.   Working Diagnosis: On the principle of heart murmur  fever  and other systemic symptoms  the working diagnosis was infective endocarditis.   Investigations: The patient was sent for blood culture  complete blood count  kidney function test  and echocardiography.  Management: While waiting for the investigation reports  Mrs. Johnson was kept on empirical treatment which included intravenous antibiotics like Vancomycin and Gentamicin  under the suspicion of infective endocarditis.  Summary: Mrs. Johnson  a middle-aged woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension  presented with persistent fever  unexplained weight loss  fatigue  and new onset of shortness of breath – likely suggestive symptoms of endocarditis. The presence of a heart murmur  Janeway lesions  and Osler nodes  as well as her symptomatology  increased the suspicion of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures and echocardiography were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and to guide targeted antibiotic therapy. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,21,Patient Presentation  Mr. Rodriguez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male presented with a 2-week history of intermittent high-grade fevers  unexplained weight loss  malaise  and fatigue. He described an initial period of flu-like symptoms which has worsened over the past few days along with increasing fatigue.   The patient has a past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Despite being advised persistently about lifestyle changes and medication adherence he has been non-compliant due to his busy work schedule. A former smoker  he quit 5 years ago but continues to consume alcohol socially. There are no known drug allergies.  Family history is significant with a father who suffered from coronary artery disease and a mother who had type 2 diabetes and died due to a stroke. One sibling out of three has hypertension.  On examination  his heart sounds revealed a regurgitant murmur heard over the apex. Scleral icterus and splenomegaly were also noted  highlighting possible hepatic involvement. Blood pressure was noted to be elevated at 145/90 mmHg.  Investigations  Lab analysis revealed elevated WBC count  ESR  and CRP—consistent with systemic inflammation. His BUN and creatinine levels were also slightly elevated  suggesting impaired renal function  possibly secondary to bacterial endotoxins and immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridians  confirming bacterial endocarditis.   An echocardiogram revealed an echogenic structure on the mitral valve consistent with vegetation  along with significant mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis and Plan  The patient was diagnosed with native valve endocarditis secondary to Streptococci viridians infection  which was likely to have originated from transient bacteremia perhaps secondary to non-sterile dental procedures  as discovered in his history.   A multi-disciplinary plan was devised involving cardiology  infectious disease  and dental teams. Mr. Rodriguez was started on Penicillin and Gentamicin according to endocarditis management guidelines targeting Streptococci. The patient was educated about his disease  the importance of medication compliance  and was provided dietary advice for his diabetes and hypertension. Frequent surveillance echocardiograms were planned  with the possibility of surgical intervention if the medical treatment failed.  Overall  the prognosis of this patient heavily depends on early diagnosis and prompt aggressive antibiotic therapy  the degree of structural heart damage  and complications that might arise such as heart failure or septic embolizations.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,22,Patient Profile: The patient is a 59-year-old Caucasian male  named Ted. Ted has been a long-term smoker  having picked up the habit in his early twenties. He was recently diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient is a retired truck driver  originally from Mississippi  but now resides in Florida. He is married  with two adult children  all in good health. Ted's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father having died of a heart attack at the age of 62 and his mother having lived with hypertension.  Concerning his past medical history  Ted was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mid-thirties. He also has been living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the past ten years  likely secondary to his extensive history of smoking. He was not taking any regular medications apart from insulin and puffing on a salbutamol inhaler occasionally when he was short of breath.  Presenting Complaint: Ted was rushed to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath  high fever  and sharp  stabbing chest pains. He also complained about fatigue  loss of weight  and decreased appetite over the past two months  which he originally disregarded  attributing them to the stresses of daily life.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  he was febrile  with a temperature of 38.6°C  blood pressure of 160/90 mm Hg  and pulse rate of 100 bpm. Heart auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Screening blood tests indicated anemia and raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  establishing the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management: Considering the diagnosis and the compromised condition of the patient  comprehensive treatment was initiated with intravenous antibiotics according to the antibiogram for six weeks. Due to the severity of the aortic regurgitation indicated by echocardiogram  and the patient’s deteriorating condition  surgical intervention was recommended. Ted is currently on the waitlist for valve replacement surgery.  Discussion: Native valve endocarditis predominantly affects men aged between 30 and 60 years old  like Ted  with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common causative organism. The most common risk factors include intravenous drug use  presence of intravascular devices  poor dental health  diabetes  and history of rheumatic heart disease. Ted's history of diabetes and poor general health secondary to smoking and COPD may also have contributed to his vulnerability.  In conclusion  Ted's case is an apt representation of how a confluence of lifestyle choices and the presence of other diseases like diabetes can contribute to the onset of severe conditions like infective endocarditis. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital for management and improved outcomes of this potentially fatal condition.   Ted's case emphasizes the importance of disease prevention  maintaining a healthy lifestyle  and regular check-ups  especially for those with chronic disorders such as diabetes. Finally  his case reminds healthcare providers of the importance of thorough investigations in symptomatic patients with a significant history of risk factors for better diagnosis and management.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,23,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Hispanic male  Mr. Gonzalez  presents with a 2-week history of increasing malaise  fatigue  and intermittent fever. He has been previously healthy  with no known history of any chronic diseases such as hypertension  diabetes  or heart disease. Mr. Gonzalez works as a construction worker and lives with his wife and two grown children. He reports no recent hospitalizations or medical procedures within the past year. He denies any recent travel  sexual promiscuity or recreational drug use  but does admit to moderate alcohol and tobacco use. No known familial history of cardiac disease.   Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  he is mildly febrile (100.3 F)  normotensive and tachycardic (HR 110/min). Cardiac auscultation reveals a new regurgitant murmur on the left lower sternal edge. He exhibits tenderness in the lumbar region. There are no septic emboli or signs of heart failure.   Diagnostic Assessment:  A full blood count shows a mild elevation in the total leukocyte count and a marked increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria. An electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia. A chest X-ray is normal. Blood cultures are taken and sent to the lab.  Given the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis  an urgent echocardiogram is performed  revealing thickening and possible vegetations on the native tricuspid valve  hence confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures eventually grew out Staphylococcus aureus.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Mr. Gonzalez is initiated on empirical antibiotics (Vancomycin and Gentamicin) as per the standard treatment protocols for native-valve infective endocarditis. Given the location of the vegetations and the fact that he isn't having septic emboli  it is decided to manage Mr. Gonzalez conservatively for now with close monitoring for heart failure symptoms and septic emboli. A cardiac surgery consult is done for evaluation and decision regarding possible future valve repair or replacement.  Follow-up and Outcome:  Outpatient follow-up is arranged with Cardiology  Infectious Disease  and Internal Medicine services at regular intervals. Mr. Gonzalez continues to show improvement in clinical symptomatology over the course of his treatment. His blood cultures turn negative  indicating successful treatment of his endocarditis.  Teaching points:  Infective endocarditis is a critical diagnosis that requires a high index of suspicion  especially in patients presenting with fever of unknown origin and new cardiac murmurs. Early diagnosis and treatment are vital in managing this potentially life-threatening illness. This case emphasizes the value of a comprehensive patient history and physical examination. The role of social and environmental factors in the development of infective endocarditis is of importance as well. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,24,Patient Presentation  The patient presented is a 60-year-old Hispanic male with an initial diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. He is a resident of New Mexico  living in an urban setting with his wife and adult children. He identifies as a non-smoker but has a history of occasional alcohol use. He has a BMI within the normal range and follows a balanced diet. However  he has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both well-controlled with medication.  The patient works as a construction contractor  a job characterized by a high level of physical activity. However  he reports being sedentary during off-work hours and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  his father having died of a heart attack at the age of 64. His mother is alive at 85 with diagnosed osteoporosis.  Clinical Findings  He was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of high-grade fever  chills  generalized fatigue  and shortness of breath for the past week. He also complained about some unintentional weight loss but denied any chest pain  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Upon physical examination  he had a systolic murmur best audible at the left lower parasternal border. His blood pressure was slightly elevated  and he displayed signs of pallor and mild peripheral edema.  Investigations and Diagnosis  Initial blood tests detected neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood culture grew Streptococcus viridans. A transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis by demonstrating vegetations on the native mitral valve with evidence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.   Treatment and Prognosis  The patient was started on high-dose penicillin G and gentamicin  which represents the initial treatment choice for Streptococcus viridans associated infective endocarditis. The patient responded well to this antibiotic regimen  with decreased fever and improved energy levels. He will continue his antibiotic regimen for a total of 4-6 weeks and will receive follow-up echocardiography evaluations to monitor the vegetations' size and valve function. The prognosis seems favorable as the patient has shown a good response to treatment. The patient has been advised about the importance of dental hygiene  which is considered a probable source of his infection.  Discussion  This case emphasizes the critical role of early diagnosis and intervention in managing infective endocarditis. An awareness of the potential complications of untreated streptococcus viridans endocarditis  such as heart failure  systemic emboli  or death  highlights the importance of stringent follow-up and compliance with antibiotics. As with this patient  individuals with a history of heart disease and diabetes seem to be at a higher risk of developing this kind of endocarditis. Therefore  regular check-ups and adherence to prescribed treatment plans are vital to mitigate these risks.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,25,Patient Presentation:  I. Demographics and History  Mr. X is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  a retired manual laborer  residing in rural Oklahoma. He lives with his spouse  is a father to 3 adults  and grandfather to 7 children. His history includes smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for 35 years  now reduced to half a pack for the last 10 years. He consumes alcohol occasionally  primarily beer. His lifestyle is relatively sedentary  and he is overweight with a BMI of 28. He has regular exposure to farm animals in his neighborhood.  II. Past Medical History  Mr. X has a medical history of poorly-controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 20 years  Hypertension for the past 15 years  and Dyslipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago. His recent health examination showed moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2). He regularly takes oral antidiabetic medications  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and statins.  III. Family History  His father died from coronary artery disease at the age of 68  and his mother passed away from a stroke. His brother lives with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His oldest child  a daughter  has recently been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. There's no history of Rheumatic heart disease  Infective endocarditis  or Immunodeficiency in his family.  IV. Presenting Complaints & Examination   Mr. X presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening shortness of breath  fatigue and moderate ongoing fever for a week. He reported a recent dental procedure six weeks ago. On physical examination  he was found to have a new cardiac murmur  a low-grade fever  and lower limb edema - indicative of congestive cardiac failure.  V. Investigations & Diagnosis  His blood cultures showed growth of Streptococcus bovis. Echocardiography confirmed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis.     VI. Treatment & Progress  Mr. X was started empirically on intravenous antibiotics Vancomycin and Gentamicin. His subsequent care was multidisciplinary  involving cardiologists  infectious disease specialists  and internal medicine specialists. He responded well to the treatment and his symptoms improved over a period of two weeks with close monitoring in the hospital.  VII. Conclusion  Mr. X's case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with a new cardiac murmur and fever  particularly those with diabetes. His case emphasizes the role of dental health and early dental intervention in the prevention of infective endocarditis. Future management might consider alteration of his diabetes care regime along with cardiac rehabilitation and infective prophylaxis during dental treatments.  In conclusion  diabetic population remains a high-risk group for infective endocarditis due to immune dysregulation and microvascular complications accompanying diabetes. Thus  meticulous oral hygiene and recognition of infective endocarditis' subtle signs are paramount in this cohort.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,26,Patient Information ------------ The case involves a 65-year-old Caucasian male named 'Mr X’. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife in the suburbs. He has a 35 pack-year smoking history and is a social drinker. Mr. X has a past medical history of rheumatic fever during his childhood  and more recently  he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 which is currently being managed with Metformin. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his mother was diagnosed with hypertension in her mid-50s. There are no known drug allergies.  Clinical Presentation ----------------------------- Mr X presented to the hospital with complaints of persistent fever  chills  fatigue  and shortness of breath over the past two weeks. Upon examination  he appeared ill and was diaphoretic. His vital signs were: blood pressure: 130/85 mm Hg  heart rate: 95 bpm  temperature: 38.5 degrees Celsius  respiratory rate: 18 breath/p.m  and oxygen saturation: 96% on room air. The physical exam revealed a new systolic murmur best heard at the apex and peripheral stigmata of endocarditis  including Janeway lesions and Osler nodes.  Investigations  --------------------- Blood cultures were taken which showed the growth of Streptococcus viridians  an organism often associated with native-valve infective endocarditis. ECG showed no acute changes  however  transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation  supporting the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Diagnosis --------------- Given the patient's presentation  his symptoms  the positive blood culture results and TTE findings  he was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Plan ---------------------- The patient was admitted to the hospital and was started on empiric IV antibiotic therapy with Penicillin G and Gentamicin  following the standard regimen for Streptococcal endocarditis. His blood glucose was monitored and managed with the existing medication. Supportive care  including fever management and IV fluids  was provided.  Prognosis ---------------- Once treated  most patients with infective endocarditis improve. However  considering Mr. X's age  comorbidities  and the severity of his valvular heart disease  full recovery is uncertain. He will need a close follow-up for monitoring his heart function and managing his diabetes. Lifestyle modifications and ongoing medications would be suggested. He might also need early valve surgery if improvements aren't seen with medical therapy.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,27,Patient Presentation:  Patient:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and atypical angina. He is a former smoker and has a long history of heavy alcohol consumption. Last year  he was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. He underwent an angioplasty 10 years ago.   Demographics:  The patient lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is retired and lives alone in a suburb  but his adult children live nearby. Despite his health issues  he is financially stable and has access to healthcare. His BMI is 28  bordering overweight and obesity.  Family History:  There is a history of heart disease in the family; his father died at 68 from a heart attack. His mother died at the age of 72 from a stroke. His younger brother has also been diagnosed with hypertension.  Presenting Issue:  The patient visited the hospital complaining of experiencing persistent and high-grade fever for the last three weeks  associated with chills  generalized fatigue  and mild chest discomfort. He mentioned intermittent episodes of night sweats and unintentional weight loss over the last month.   Clinical Examination:  On examination  his vital signs were found to be; Temp: 101.4°F  HR: 110 beats/min  RR: 18 breaths/min  BP: 160/95 mmHg. He was conscious  but appeared fatigued. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new-onset murmur. Breath sounds were found to be diminished bilaterally. Pedal edema was noted on the lower extremities.  Investigation:  Complete blood count reported raised WBC count (16 000 cells/cu.mm). Echocardiographic findings were consistent with infective endocarditis revealing vegetation on the mitral valve. Blood cultures were sent for identification of the causative organism. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflated lung fields indicative of his known COPD condition.  Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis given his symptoms  laboratory findings  and the discovery of vegetation on the mitral valve via echocardiogram. The findings have prompted urgent medical intervention.  Treatment Plan:  The patient was immediately started on empiric antibiotics therapy  adjusting upon blood culture results. Due to the potential risk of embolic events  hospital admission is necessary. Once stabilized  invasive treatment options like valve replacement surgery will be considered.  Follow up:  Frequent follow-ups will be necessary to monitor response to treatment. Besides  tighter control of his co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension will also be emphasized as part of his broader management plan.  Psychosocial Aspects:  Given the patient’s alcohol history and sedentary lifestyle  counseling and possible referral to support programs should be explored. His social support system (his adult children) should be engaged in the management plan to help with encouragement  compliance with medications  and lifestyle modifications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,28,Patient Presentation  Patient Profile: Subject is a 62-year-old male with a recorded diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). He identifies as African American  residing in an urban community in the Midwest. He was previously a smoker with an extensive history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes  before his hospital admission.  His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and obesity. The patient  however  does not have any known drug allergies. His regular medication list includes Metformin  Atorvastatin  and Lisinopril.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient has had a progressive fever over two weeks  accompanied by fatigue  a documented weight loss  and shortness of breath. He was initially unaware of the gravity of these symptoms  attributing them to the weather and his age  before his condition deteriorated significantly.   Family History: There's a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  with both his parents dying from heart-related conditions in their late sixties. His elder brother was earlier diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appeared lethargic and in distress. His temperature was 38.8 C  blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg  heart rate of 90 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. There were signs of systemic embolization  evidenced by petechiae on his upper body and legs.   Investigations: Blood tests revealed an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) indicating a systemic inflammatory state. His blood glucose level was high  at 250mg/dL. Blood cultures showed growth of Streptoсoccus bovis  a common organism responsible for native-valve IE. An Echocardiogram (ECHO-Test) indicated vegetations on the mitral valve  further confirming the diagnosis.  Conclusion: Given his background of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiovascular disease  the patient was at high risk for IE. The clinical presentation of undulant fever  coupled with the results from the blood tests and ECHO  confirmed a diagnosis of native-valve IE.   The case illustrates the necessity of a high degree of suspicion for IE in patients with persistent fevers  history of chronic illnesses  and cardiovascular disease. The findings underscore the importance of early detection and prompt  aggressive antibiotic therapy together with tight control over diabetes  which may modify the disease progression and overall prognosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,29,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 59-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  who presented with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and loss of appetite. His fever ranged between 100-103°F. Alongside  he had experienced occasional discomfort in the chest region.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith was previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  managed with metformin. He also had a history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation five years ago and has been on warfarin since then. There was no known history of IV drug use  blood transfusion  dental procedures  or recent travels. He had no prior surgeries or hospitalizations.  Family History  His family history revealed his father suffered from coronary artery disease and his mother had rheumatoid arthritis. His younger brother has been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.  Presentation on Examination  Physical examination showed Mr. Smith had a fever of 101.6°F  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  and heart rate of 105 beats per minute  irregular. He had pallor but no jaundice or cyanosis. On auscultation  a new early diastolic murmur was noticed in the mitral region. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis (Osler’s nodes  Janeway lesions).  Investigations  Blood tests revealed anemia  raised ESR levels  and leucocytosis. Liver and kidney function tests were normal. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained and grew Streptococcus viridans. ECG showed irregularly irregular rhythm. Chest X-ray was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mobile mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggestive of vegetation.  Diagnosis  Considering his clinical features  presence of new onset heart murmur  positive blood cultures of a common causative agent (Streptococcus viridans)  and echocardiographic evidence of vegetations on the mitral valve  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Treatment  Mr. Smith was started on empiric antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis as per the local antibiotic policy  which was later tailored according to the blood culture and sensitivity report.  Follow Up  After a course of intravenous antibiotics for six weeks  his symptoms improved. Repeated blood cultures were negative  and a follow-up echocardiogram showed a significant reduction in vegetation size.  This case presentation represents the characteristic demographics found in literature for infective endocarditis: a male patient with a pre-existing heart condition and diabetes mellitus at an advanced age  not currently using intravenous drugs.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,30,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 60 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Married  Occupation: Retired banker  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with persistent fever  chills  fatigue  new onset of heart murmur  and unexplained weight loss over the past three weeks.  Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of mitral valve prolapse discovered ten years ago which is currently mild and asymptomatic. Apart from that  he also suffers from controlled hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He underwent an appendectomy 30 years ago. Mr. Doe is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Medication: The patient is on regular medications which include Metoprolol for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes.  Family History: His mother died of myocardial infarction and his father had cerebrovascular stroke. There is no family history of heart valve disease or endocarditis.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed no visible anomalies. However  heart assessment confirms a new heart murmur and occasional irregular heartbeats were detected. No Janeway lesions  splinter hemorrhages  or Osler's nodes were visible. Baseline vitals include a fever of 38.2 degrees Celsius  blood pressure 142/88 mmHg  and heart rate of 90 beats per minute.  Investigation: Preliminary blood tests revealed increased ESR and CRP level suggesting inflammation and raised WBC count indicating an ongoing infection. Blood culture results are pending. Echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations on the mitral valve  which supported the suspicion of endocarditis further.  Conclusion: The patient's clinical picture combined with investigation findings is suggestive of infective endocarditis. The mitral valve appears to be the affected valve  which may be related to his known history of mitral valve prolapse. As the patient's condition is severe  he will need hospitalization  intravenous antibiotics  and regular monitoring. The treatment plan and prognosis will be firmed up once the blood culture reveals the causative organism. This case reflects the importance of altering the physical examination fundamentals  investigating  diagnosing  and managing patients with known heart valve abnormalities presenting with fever and new murmurs promptly  as it can potentially progress to life-threatening complications.   NOTE: This is a simulated case review based on theoretical knowledge. For actual clinical practice  all patient management and treatment plans should be made based on the individual patient's current presentation and history.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,31,Patient Presentation  Mr. C is a 58-year-old African American man presenting with a 2-week history of fever  fatigue  and shortness of breath. He reports a minimum of three episodes daily of fever spiking to 102°F  along with night sweats and weight loss of about 8 pounds in two weeks. He has a past medical history of mild hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are well-controlled with medication. Mr. C also reports a history of IV drug abuse 20 years ago but has been clean since then.   The patient works as a construction worker and lives with his wife and two adult children. There's a family history of rheumatic heart disease on his father's side but no known inherited conditions. He has a smoking history of 15 pack-years and has minimal alcohol intake.  Physical Examination  On presentation  he appeared diaphoretic and dyspneic. His vital signs revealed a temperature of 39.1°C  blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg  heart rate of 102/min  respiratory rate of 24/min  and an oxygen saturation of 92% in room air. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Splinter hemorrhages were observed under several nails  and Janeway lesions were present on his palms and soles.  Investigations  Blood investigations indicated anemia (Hgb: 10g/dl) and elevated inflammatory markers (WCC: 16x109/L; CRP: 150mg/L). Initial peripheral blood cultures were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed large vegetations on the tricuspid valve suggestive of endocarditis.   Diagnosis and Treatment  Mr. C was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  with a likely portal of entry due to Staphylococcus aureus. He was immediately commenced on standard therapy with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin.  In conclusion  Mr. C's case demonstrates infective endocarditis predominantly affecting individuals with underlying heart disease or history of IV drug use. The demographic data aligns with literature that reports a higher prevalence of infective endocarditis among middle-aged males and African American populations. The management of Mr. C's case also underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  infectious disease specialists  and potentially cardiothoracic surgery in achieving optimal patient outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,32,Patient Profile: The patient is a 62-year-old African American male named Mr. A. He lives in urban New York City and is a retired bus driver. He lives alone and has limited social support. He has a past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension and occasional alcohol consumption. The patient denied any use of intravenous drug. He has no known family history of heart diseases.  Presenting Complaint and History of Present Illness: Mr. A presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of intermittent high-grade fever and one-week history of worsening shortness of breath with associated dry cough. He also noticed weight loss  fatigue and night sweats over the past month. He denied any chest pain  orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He had also developed a new murmur that was auscultated during a recent clinic visit.  Clinical Findings: On examination  Mr. A was febrile with a temperature of 38.8°C. He appeared to be in mild distress while breathing. He had uncontrolled blood pressure and an irregular pulse was noted. Several classical signs of infective endocarditis were detected  including Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new onset diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Lung examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally. No other organomegaly was appreciated on abdominal examination.  Investigative Report: Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. His blood glucose levels were considerably high. Three sets of blood cultures were performed and he was started on empiric antibiotic therapy.   Two days later  the blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus viridans  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram demonstrated a large vegetation on the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. His uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes with poor blood sugar control possibly contributed to the development of endocarditis.  Treatment Plan: The treatment prescribed includes six weeks of intravenous antibiotics. However  due to the extent of his mitral valve disease  he was referred to a cardiovascular surgeon for evaluation of potential valve repair or replacement.  Conclusion: The prognosis of Mr. A depends on the severity of his present condition  as well as well as how successful his future treatment would be. It will be necessary to monitor his other comorbidities closely during the course of his treatment  as well as establish robust support system in managing his condition post-discharge.  This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of infective endocarditis  especially in those with predisposing conditions like uncontrolled diabetes  which microscopically damage the blood vessels  making them more prone to such infections.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,33,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. X  who was admitted to the hospital with a tentative diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Mr. X is a retired blue-collar worker whose previous medical history includes treatment for Type II Diabetes and hypertension. He has a history of smoking approximately a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years  despite being advised by medical professionals to quit due to increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. He does not drink alcohol excessively or engage in recreational drug use.   Family History:  His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases: both parents had coronary artery disease and died in their 70s from myocardial infarction. His mother also had type II diabetes mellitus  similar to him.  Clinical Examination and Investigations:  Mr. X presented to the hospital with complaints of generalized fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past few weeks. He also reported experiencing occasional shortness of breath. On examination  he was febrile with a new heart murmur that was not present during a routine check-up a year ago. Blood tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) and three blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  consistent with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of vegetations on the native aortic valve  and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation was observed. These clinical features and investigations align with the modified Duke’s criteria for a diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   The patient's deteriorating health status seemingly correlated with his physical examination revealing Janeway lesions and Osler nodes  which are indicative of endocarditis.   Mr. X also underwent a full-body PET-CT scan to rule out potential metastatic infection  particularly in his spine or elsewhere  since Staphylococcus aureus is known for its potential to cause metastatic infections in endocarditis patients. Thankfully  no metastatic infection was revealed by the scan.  Case Summary:  As of now  the patient has been started on a regimen of intravenous antibiotics according to hospital protocol for management of native valve endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. His blood glucose levels are being monitored due to his history of diabetes. Moreover  he has been advised to cease smoking for his overall cardiovascular health. Cardiovascular surgeons have also been consulted given the moderate aortic regurgitation and they concluded that surgical intervention may be required if the infection doesn't clear or if his condition worsens.  This case epitomizes the classic clinical presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis with its common risk factors - age  male gender  and prior heart conditions. It has been documented that men are more frequently affected by this condition and the prevalence increases with age. As such  this case presentation is a practical demonstration of the typical demographic depiction of this disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,34,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the clinic with complaints of intermittent fevers  chills  fatigue  and malaise for the past two weeks. He also reported a recent onset of unusual bruising on his fingers and toes  which he attributes to the fact that he might be accidentally bumping into things more often lately. His past medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis  for which he takes methotrexate  and hypertension controlled by amlodipine.  Complete Demographic Information:  John is a retired lawyer  a lifelong non-smoker who drinks socially  one to two standard drinks per week on average. He is married with three children and currently lives in suburban Massachusetts. John has never traveled outside of the United States.  Family History:  The patient’s father experienced a MI at the age of 65  and his mother is alive and well at 88 years old with a diagnosis of hypertension. John lost his younger brother due to a stroke at the age of 52. His children  two daughters and a son  are healthy.   Diagnosis:  Based on his presentation  John was suspected to have infective endocarditis (IE)  and diagnosis was confirmed by positive blood cultures showing Streptococcus viridans and echocardiogram findings of vegetation in mitral valve.  Discussion:  John's case raises the point of a crucial intersection between his rheumatoid arthritis and the new diagnosis of IE. A research study shows an association between an increased risk of IE and rheumatoid arthritis patients (Baddley et al.  2018). Given John's clinical presentation and blood culture results  it appears that he may have native valve infective endocarditis likely caused by Streptococcus viridans  which is commonly associated with endocarditis in patients with structurally normal heart valves (Cahill  Prendergast  2016). Treatment plan includes intravenous antibiotics.  This case provides an opportunity to highlight the utmost importance of considering a diagnosis of infective endocarditis in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms like fever  fatigue  bruising  especially in the presence of any risk factors. This can lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment  reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.   Cahill  T. J.  & Prendergast  B. D. (2016). Infective endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,35,Patient Presentation:  The patient  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented with a four-week history of malaise  low grade fever  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  and mild dyspnea on exertion. The patient denied a history of intravenous drug use  recent dental procedures  and any recent infections. He had a known history of Diabetes Mellitus (type II) controlled on Metformin. No history of any cardiac disease was reported. No other significant family history was elicited.  Physical examination revealed anemic pallor and mild splenomegaly. Cardiac auscultation revealed a harsh grade III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex. No Osler nodes  Janeway lesions  petechiae  or Roth spots were noted.  Workup:  A complete blood count showed normocytic normochromic anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. Blood cultures were drawn  which grew Staphylococcus aureus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started while waiting for the culture results.  Further investigations  including transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography  confirmed the presence of large vegetations on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve indicative of infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient was started on a six-week course of intravenous [antibiotic specific to the organism found on blood culture  typically for S. aureus would be flucloxacillin (for methicillin-susceptible strains) or vancomycin (for methicillin-resistant strains)].  However  due to the large size of the vegetations  the patient was at high risk of embolic complications. Thus  after initial stabilization and heart team discussion  the patient underwent a successful mitral valve replacement. Postoperative recovery was smooth  and there were no complications.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis  specifically in native valves  tends to occur more frequently in older individuals with a underlying heart disease. Importantly  in our patient  the diagnosis was made solely due to the extended history of fever  malaise  and new cardiac murmur  highlighting the importance of including infective endocarditis under differential diagnosis in similar cases. The patient's diabetes might have contributed to his overall susceptibility for infection. Seasoned clinicians must judiciously deploy their diagnostic acumen to pinpoint such valvular infections  since early detection and intervention dramatically alter the prognosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,36,Patient Presentation: The patient  Mr. Silva  is a 60-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis (IE). Born and raised in Houston  Texas  he worked as an electrician until retirement. He is a former smoker and reports a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Silva has a history of hypertension which was diagnosed 10 years ago and remains controlled with medication. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  which he manages with diet  medication  and regular exercise. His only surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in 1980. No prior history of illicit drug use. He does not report any allergic reactions to medications.  Family History: Mr. Silva's father died of myocardial infarction in his late 60s and his mother passed away from breast cancer in her early 70s. He has two siblings; an elder brother has a history of coronary artery disease and a younger sister is healthy. None of his family members have been diagnosed with infective endocarditis.  Social History: Mr. Silva is married and lives with his wife. He has three children  all of whom are healthy. He has a pet dog at home. He is retired and often spends his time doing gardening. He denies any drug use  including intravenous drug abuse.  Clinical Findings: Mr. Silva was admitted to the hospital complaining of fatigue  shortness of breath  and low-grade fever for three weeks. On physical examination  a systolic murmur was noted. Initial workup revealed leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Chest radiography was negative for any active lung lesions.  Diagnosis: Echocardiography findings showed vegetations on the native aortic valve  confirming the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures were positive for S. aureus.  Disease Management and Follow-up: Currently  Mr. Silva is on empiric antibiotic therapy following the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for native valve endocarditis caused by S. aureus. Cardiac surgeons are consulted regarding possible valve replacement surgery in the future. His blood glucose and blood pressure levels are monitored as per protocol to manage his pre-existing conditions.  This case is slightly atypical as the highest prevalence of infective endocarditis occurs among males aged 30 to 50 with a history of IV drug use. However  it nonetheless underlines the importance of considering IE in older patients with cardiovascular disease who present with prolonged fatigue  fever and newly noted heart murmurs.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,37,Patient Information: Mr. John  a 64-year-old African-American male  was admitted to the hospital with complaints of persistent fever  malaise  and shortness of breath. He mentioned that he occasionally injects illicit drugs. He has a past medical history of hypertension  chronic hepatitis C  and substance use disorder. The patient is a mechanic by profession and has no known allergies. He lives alone and his family history includes cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.  Clinical Findings: On admission  Mr. John's vitals revealed a fever of 102°F  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 105 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 20 per min. The patient appeared fatigued with mild distress due to shortness of breath. Initial physical exam revealed the presence of Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes  suggesting potential infective endocarditis. Cardiac auscultation identified a new regurgitant murmur. Skin examination showed needle track marks.  Diagnostic Assessment: Lab results showed elevated levels of white blood cells (14 × 103/μL)  indicating infection. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  and echocardiogram confirmed vegetation on the mitral valve. His illicit drug use elevates the risk of native valve endocarditis.   Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. John was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime. Once blood cultures confirmed Staphylococcus aureus  treatment was adjusted to nafcillin and gentamicin. The cardiology team was consulted  and due to severe mitral regurgitation with resultant heart failure  they scheduled him for surgery to replace the damaged valve. Meanwhile  a substance abuse consultation was requested  to work on a plan for managing his substance use disorder.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Post valve replacement  the patient's symptoms significantly improved. His fever resolved and his white blood cell count normalized. An antibiotic regimen was continued for a complete 6-week course. Mr. John was discharged with follow-up appointments with the cardiology  infectious disease  and substance abuse teams. He was urged to quit illicit drugs and was provided with the requisite resources.  Patient Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for presenting this case anonymously.  This is a fairly typical case presentation for a patient with native valve infective endocarditis  taking into account both the individual patient information and the demographics often seen in the literature for this condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,38,Clinical Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The patient is a 50-year-old African American male  residing in an urban community. His occupation is truck driving. The patient is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a documented history of diabetes and hypertension for the past fifteen years. He has no known allergies but is currently taking medications for his chronic health conditions. He has a family history of coronary heart disease (his father had a heart attack at age 65). The patient lives alone and has been widowed for three years.  Presenting Condition: The patient presented at the hospital with a one-week history of intermittent fevers  fatigue  loss of appetite  and unexpected weight loss over the past month. He's experiencing shortness of breath  more aggravated upon exertion.   Clinical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared moderately ill  with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg. The temperature was 101.5F. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. There were no peripheral vascular manifestations of endocarditis  such as Osler nodes or Janeway lesions. The rest of the physical examination was normal.   Investigations: Laboratory examinations showed a high white blood cell count of 15 000/μL with 80% neutrophils. ESR was 85 mm/hour  and C-reactive protein was 120 mg/L. The blood glucose level and A1C were elevated  suggestive of poorly controlled diabetes. Additional blood tests  urine analysis  chest X-ray  and EKG were within normal limits.   Diagnosis: Three sets of blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a vegetation measuring 1.5 cm on the aortic valve. Based on these clinical and lab findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The diabetic regimen was optimized for better control.   Patient progression: After one month  the patient's condition improved significantly – fevers ceased  blood cultures became negative  and his diabetes was better controlled. The patient was educated about the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and managing diabetes and hypertension effectively to prevent recurrent episodes in the future.  This case encompasses a great representation of an African American male demographic having a prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and complications such as infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,39,Patient Profile  Mr. A is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of Intravenous (IV) drug use and more recently diagnosed with HIV infection. He has been living in a suburban area of Phoenix  Arizona. He has been married for 30 years and has three adult children. He is a retired mechanic and his wife is a homemaker.  History of Present Illness  The patient presents with a 4-week history of intermittent fevers  night sweats  and a loss of appetite  accompanied by a weight loss of approximately ten pounds within a three-week period. He reports experiencing profound fatigue and generalized body malaise.   Medical History  Mr. A has a past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Hepatitis C infection. He was diagnosed as HIV positive five years ago  which is believed to be a result of his IV drug use in the past. He is currently on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mr. A's other medications include Metformin for his diabetes  Lisinopril for his hypertension  and Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for Hepatitis C. His compliance to these medications is inconsistent owing to his substance misuse.  Family History  His father died at the age of 70 from Myocardial infarction and his mother is alive and well at 89  with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There is no history of cardiomyopathy  cancer  or genetic disease in the family to his knowledge.  Physical Examination and Investigations  Upon physical examination  Mr. A appears cachectic and chronically ill. Oral sores indicating possible oral candidiasis were noted. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal edge. His vitals were BP – 130/80 mmHg  Pulse – 110 bpm  Temperature – 38.5°C  Respiration – 16 breaths per minute. Investigations were ordered including blood cultures  echocardiography  CD4 count  and other routine blood work.   Diagnosis  Her blood cultures grew Streptococcus bovis and his transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetation on the aortic valve  confirming a diagnosis of native valve Infective Endocarditis (IE).   In conclusion  the patient's age  a vulnerable immune system secondary to HIV infection  history of IV drug use and positive blood cultures with echocardiography findings were significant contributors to his diagnosis of native-valve IE. With the complex nature of Mr. A's medical profile  timely and comprehensive medical management  alongside consistent monitoring will form a crucial part of his treatment plan.

Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled type-II diabetes mellitus  with occasional instances of non-compliance to medication and dietary restrictions. He also suffers from mild hypertension. There is no record of prior surgeries or significant illnesses. He reports a recent  unexplained weight loss having lost around 10 lbs in the past month.  Family History:  His father passed away at 75 from heart disease and mother also had a history of diabetes and hypertension. He has two siblings  one of whom is living and healthy  and another passed away from lung cancer associated with heavy smoking.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  night sweats  fatigue  and new-onset shortness of breath.   Diagnosis:  Upon further investigation - blood tests  imaging  and echocardiography - patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures have grown Streptococcus oralis  suggesting a possible oral-source for the endocarditis.   Hospital Course: Given the presence of valvular vegetation on echo  the patient was immediately started on IV antibiotics in the hospital. Hemodynamic status remained stable. The patient's response to empiric antibiotic therapy was robust  with resolution of fever and improvement in his overall condition. Blood cultures turned negative after 5 days of therapy. The cardiology team is involved in his care  and they have recommended against early surgical intervention given his stable condition and improvement with medical management.  Discharge Plan: The patient is planned to be discharged on a 6-week regimen of home IV antibiotics  with home health assigned to assist with the regimen. He will follow-up with his primary care provider for ongoing diabetes and hypertension management  and with the infectious disease specialist and cardiologist at the hospital clinic for close monitoring of his endocarditis.   This case emphasizes the need for high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with predisposing factors  such as older age  male sex  African-American race  and lower socio-economic status  as well as common comorbidities like diabetes  smoking  and hypertension. The case also underscores the vital importance of patient education and adherence to not just endocarditis treatment  but also to management of underlying chronic diseases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,43,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. Martinez Age: 58 years old Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino Occupation: Construction worker Location: Florida  United States  Brief History: Mr. Martinez was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever  fatigue  weight loss and night sweats for the past three weeks. These symptoms were associated with intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath. There was no recent travel  unusual dietary intake or exposure to sick contacts. He denies any recreational drug use.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez was previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are fairly controlled with lifestyle modifications and oral medications. He has a history of Rheumatic fever at the age of 14  and a subsequent Mitral valve disease. However  these conditions were managed conservatively  and he was asymptomatic hence was not on any anticoagulant therapy before this admission. There is no history of previous surgeries or procedures. Also  he doesn't have a history of any psychiatric illness.  Family History: His father had heart disease and passed away at the age of 68. His mother is still alive and has been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes and hypertension. His one elder brother has coronary artery disease and his two younger sisters are healthy.  Social History: Mr. Martinez is a smoker with a 35 pack-year history and also consumes alcohol occasionally. He lives with his wife and has two healthy adult children. He works as a construction worker and does not exercise regularly due to his workload.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a frail man with pallor  lower limb pitting edema and clubbing of fingers. Cardiovascular examination revealed the presence of a systolic murmur in the mitral area and signs of heart failure with peripheral edema. Respiratory examination revealed fine crepitations at lung bases suggesting possible pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac dysfunction.  Investigations: His blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers  ESR and CRP. His full blood count showed a mild anemia and leukocytosis. Mr. Martinez also had mild renal impairment and electrolyte imbalances  possibly due to the recurrent vomiting and poor oral intake. The chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with features of mild pulmonary congestion. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.  This  together with his clinical presentation allowed us to diagnose Mr. Martinez with native valve infective endocarditis.  Proposed Management: Antimicrobial therapy was initiated based on the blood culture and sensitivity results. Mr. Martinez was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and consideration of a possible mitral valve replacement procedure. He was also seen by a dietician due to his poor nutritional status secondary to the weight loss  diabetes and renal impairment.   This case presents an example of a common clinical picture for native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient with underlying valve disease secondary to an early rheumatic fever exposure.  Going forward  Mr. Martinez’s condition needs significant changes in his lifestyle to prevent further complication or recurrence of this severe infection. Along with these  rehabilitation  along with mental and social support is deemed necessary  given the socio-economic status and demanding nature of the patient's occupation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,44,Patient Presentation  Demographics  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  John  who lives in a suburban community.  Presenting Complaint  John presented to the emergency department complaining of malaise  low-grade fever  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss.  Past Medical History  His past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he had undergone angioplasty. Moreover  he has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication. His other past medical history includes recurrences of rheumatic fever in childhood. He is also a retired miner suggesting potential for occupational exposure to silica  with some periods of homelessness and habitual excessive alcohol consumption.  Family History  Both his parents died of cardiovascular diseases. His brother has diabetes and a sister with breast cancer. However  the patient has no family history of endocarditis.  Clinical Findings  On examination  he appeared pale  diaphoretic  and fatigued. He had a low-grade fever (38.1°C) and his blood pressure was low (90/60 mmHg). He exhibited signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis including Janeway lesions and Osler nodes. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new  low-intensity heart murmur suggestive of valvular insufficiency.  Investigations  A complete blood count showed leukocytosis and anemia. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level pointed towards an ongoing inflammatory process. The blood culture results reported Streptococcus viridans. John had a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which revealed vegetation on the mitral valve and moderate mitral regurgitation  indicating infective endocarditis (IE).  Diagnosis  John was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment   John was started on empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone per the IDSA guidelines until culture and sensitivities were available. After that  antibiotics were trimmed down to a penicillin-based therapy due to the organism's sensitivity. He was also monitored for any complications.  Discussion  Native valve endocarditis is a form of infective endocarditis affecting a non-prosthetic  native valve. The most common organism is Streptococcus viridans. In this case  John's history of CAD  episodes of rheumatic fever  and lifestyle all pose as risk factors. His clinical manifestations  positive culture  and TTE findings confirmed the diagnosis. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality.   Conclusion   The diagnosis of IE should be considered in patients with new or worsening murmur  persistent or recurrent fevers  and peripheral signs of endocarditis as in John's case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,45,Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African American male  presents to the hospital with complains of prolonged fever  chills  unexplained weight loss  and night sweats for the past three weeks. He lives alone in a low-income neighborhood of Chicago and has a history of occasional alcohol use and smoking for several decades.   Past Medical History: The patient's medical history reveals he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis ten years prior. He has been consistently managing this condition with oral medications  including methotrexate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However  he admits to missing doses due to financial constraints. In addition  he has been treated thrice in the past for episodes of pneumonia and has been suffering from poor dental health with recent invasive dental procedure approximately a month ago. He has not undergone any cardiac surgeries in the past nor has a medical or familial history of heart diseases  valve injury or IV drug use.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson primarily complains of high grade fever with chills  excessive sweating at night  episodes of cough and chest pain  loss of appetite  and rapid weight loss. He also mentions experiencing increased fatigue and difficulty in breathing when performing his daily activities  which he attributes to his old age.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears fatigued. He has a low-grade fever (38.3 degrees Celsius) and his examination reveals the presence of a new systolic murmur heard best at the apex. There is evidence of poor dental hygiene. There are no abnormal findings related to the joints.  Laboratory and Imaging Study: His blood work shows increased ESR and CRP levels  suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory process. The complete blood count with differential shows a slight increase in the neutrophil count suggesting an ongoing infection. Three sets of blood culture tests were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed vegetations on his native mitral valve  confirming our suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Management and Follow-up: Mr. Johnson was immediately started on empiric antibiotic therapy according to the culture & sensitivity report  in accordance with the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management of endocarditis. This included intravenous administration of bactericidal antibiotics for a median duration of four weeks. In addition  his dental health was addressed and optimized to prevent recurrence of the infection.  The patient was educated about the importance of medication adherence and the possible complications  including heart failure and septic emboli  arising from untreated infective endocarditis. A follow up appointment has been scheduled in two weeks to assess his response to antibiotic treatment and overall cardiac functioning. He is also being referred to a social worker to help him apply for medication assistance programs.  Conclusion: Mr. Johnson’s case exemplifies the potential life-threatening complications of infective endocarditis  highlighting the importance of early detection and treatment. His case highlights the socio-economic factors that can interfere with adherence to therapy and the potential of such factors to influence disease course.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,46,Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male  currently unemployed and living alone in a single-family home. He is a smoker  with a 15-pack year history  but denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He was previously employed as a construction worker.  Presentation:  He presented to the emergency department with a four-week history of malaise  fatigue  low-grade fever  and unexplained weight loss of approximately 8 pounds. He also reported shortness of breath upon exertion and occasional chest pains. He noted a new-onset rash on his palm and soles  along with painful swelling of one of his elbows.  Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for rheumatic fever as a child  and he disclosed a recent oral surgery about six weeks ago. Additionally  he has untreated hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He reports no known drug allergies.  Family History:  His father had a cardiovascular disease and hypertension. His mother is alive and well at 74  but has a history of rheumatic fever and osteoarthritis. He has a younger sister who is in good health. However  there is no known family history of endocarditis  autoimmune disorders  or malignancies.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  his blood pressure was high 140/95 mmHg  heart rate was elevated 110 beats per minute  and he was slightly febrile at 100.4℉. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new 3/6 diastolic murmur noted at the apex. There were Janeway lesions (painless erythematous lesions) on the palms and soles  and Osler’s nodes (painful nodules) were present on the tips of fingers. Also  he had slight erythema and swelling over his right elbow.  Investigations:  His laboratory investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)  leukocytosis  and positive blood cultures for Streptococcus mutans  an organism that is normally found in the mouth and is a common cause of endocarditis after oral procedures. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  Diagnosis and Plan:  He was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis (IE). The infection was likely secondary to the recent oral procedure he underwent  and his past medical history of rheumatic fever might have made him more susceptible. He was admitted for intravenous antibiotics according to the sensitivity of the cultured organism and would likely require long term treatment. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation is recommended due to the possibility of valve damage which might require surgical intervention.   Additional considerations include substance abuse counseling for his smoking history and management of his untreated hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,47,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Mr. A  a 55-year-old Caucasian man  presented in the emergency room; he works as a welder and is married with two grown-up children.   History and Presentation: He has had a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease but has never undergone heart surgery. He has been suffering from general malaise  intermittent fevers  and night sweats for the past three weeks. He acknowledged that his symptoms have been escalating for the past five days alongside unexplained weight loss. Additionally  he complains of a new-onset  progressive shortness of breath  especially on exertion.  There is an absence of history of IV drug abuse  alcoholism  or any sexually transmitted infections. His family history reveals his father succumbed to a myocardial infarction in his early 60s  while the patient’s mother suffers from hypothyroidism. There were no known cases of endocarditis or chronic diseases in the rest of the family.  Examination Findings: On examination  he appeared fatigued. His temperature was 38.6°C. A new murmur was noted upon cardiac auscultation. He also presented with Janeway lesions on the palms  petechiae in his conjunctiva  and Osler’s nodes on his fingers.  Further Investigations: Chest x-ray results were within normal limits  while the EKG showed no signs of ischemia  just mild left atrial enlargement. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a mobile vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation. Blood work showed increased inflammatory markers. Blood cultures were taken  which identified Streptococcus viridans  pointing to the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   Treatment and Progress: He was started on empirical antibiotic therapy with penicillin and gentamicin as per the American Heart Association guidelines. After blood culture sensitivity results  his treatment was deescalated to Penicillin G  which was continued for a total of four weeks. Anticoagulation therapy was withheld considering the risks of intracranial hemorrhage.  Conclusion: The patient responded well to the therapy  with resolution of fever and improvement in his general condition over time. However  he was advised to have follow-up outpatient visits and to observe dental hygiene strictly to prevent recurrent infective endocarditis. The scenario highlights the necessity for early identification and prompt treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Note that this is a fictional representation of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis based on common presentations. Always refer to the current clinical guidelines when making treatment decisions. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,48,Patient Presentation  John Doe  an unmarried 60-year-old white male construction worker  has resided in Oregon for the majority of his life. The patient is 5’11” tall and weighs around 190 lbs (BMI: 27)  categorizing him as 'Overweight'. His BMI indicates that he is at risk for both diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. He does not smoke or take illicit drugs  and displays moderate consumption of alcohol.  Past medical history reveals Type II diabetes for the past ten years  controlled with diet and Metformin. Recently  he had dental extraction two months ago. He has no known allergies. He never traveled outside the U.S.  got no pets  tattoos or body piercings.  The patient's family history reveals his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 55  and his younger brother  currently 57  has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. His mother  aged 86  is alive with a history of hypertension  and his two sisters  aged 62 and 58  are both hypertension-free and cardiac disease-free.  A physical examination showed the patient's temperature to be intermittently febrile for the past week with a range of 99.5°F to 101.3°F. He has also been experiencing fatigue  chills  and a noticeable shortness of breath during daily activities over the past week. The presence of heart murmur was observed during auscultation. No needle tract marks were noted that would indicate intravenous drug use.  A blood culture showed the presence of Streptococcus viridans  an organism that can often cause infective endocarditis following a dental procedure. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis as it depicted affected valves and vegetation.  Given his recent dental procedure  a history of Type II diabetes (putting him at a higher risk for infections)  and currently observed symptoms  Mr. Doe is diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management will comprise of long duration antibiotics  notably ampicillin/sulbactam or vancomycin  and supportive care. Furthermore  educating the patient about maintaining oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups will be pertinent to prevent any future recurrences. Regular follow-ups to evaluate response to treatment  renal function  and any antibiotic-related side effects will be of paramount importance. Finally  the scenario warrants a discussion about a healthier lifestyle and possibly pharmacotherapy to manage his weight to lower the risk of diabetes and cardiac disease complications.    This case serves as a valuable reminder for the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients who present with fevers  particularly in those with a recent dental procedure and a history of certain comorbidities  like diabetes.

He is Roman Catholic and regularly attends church in his local community.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. A was presented to the hospital with a 2-week history of persistent fever (38.5-39.1°C)  chills  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss (a reduction in weight of about 8 pounds).  Past Medical History: Mr. A was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus at 45 years of age which is reasonably well controlled with Metformin. He has a history of untreated rheumatic fever in childhood and was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve at age 40. He has a history of high blood pressure  for which he takes Lisinopril.  Family History:  There is a family history of heart disease with his father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. His mother had rheumatoid arthritis and both his older siblings have type 2 Diabetes.  Examination: Mr. A appeared unwell and was febrile at presentation. On cardiac auscultation  a new grade 4/6 ejection systolic murmur was heard at the left sternal edge. Blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg and pulse was 100 bpm.  Investigations: Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein  ESR)  evidence of normocytic anemia and raised renal function tests. His HbA1C level was 7.2% indicating suboptimal control of his diabetes. An echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the aortic valve confirming a diagnosis of aortic valve endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus.  Plan: Mr. A was started on empirical intravenous anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (Flucloxacillin and Rifampicin)  pending sensitivity results. Involvement of cardiothoracic surgery as an outpatient regarding potential aortic valve replacement after completion of his course of intravenous antibiotics.  Future Advice: Major lifestyle modifications were recommended  including advice on smoking cessation and alcohol moderation. His antihypertensive and diabetic medications were also optimized. All advice was also suited to his cultural and religious beliefs.   End-note: This case illustrates the classic clinical presentation of native valve infective endocarditis. Delay in diagnosis can result in worsening prognosis and emphasizes the importance of early recognition. These changes will also have a significant impact on his overall cardiovascular risk in the long term.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,50,Patient Presentation:  The case concerns a 67-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. S. He was a retired janitor  living with his wife in a suburban community. Mr. S was a non-smoker and reported occasional alcohol use on social events. His family history revealed that his father died following a stroke at the age of 75 and his mother had a history of diabetes and passed away from renal complications at the age of 83. No other significant family medical history was indicated.   Past Medical History:  Six years prior to his endocarditis diagnosis  Mr. S was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He had been managing his conditions with a combination of metformin  amlodipine  and lifestyle modifications. Additionally  he had a history of a dental abscess 5 months prior to his endocarditis diagnosis for which he received treatment but did not undergo any prophylactic antibiotic treatment.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. S presented with a three-week history of malaise  fever  night sweats  and unintended weight loss. He had no history of recreational drug use or any recent surgical intervention.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  he was found febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F)  a heart rate of 95 beats per minute  a blood pressure of 140/95 mm Hg  and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Significant findings included a new heart murmur on auscultation  and Osler nodes on his fingers. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Laboratory blood analysis revealed high ESR  CRP and the presence of anemia. Cultures of blood revealed Streptococcus viridans  indicating a probable oral flora origin of bacteremia. An echocardiogram showed mobile vegetations on his mitral valve.  Diagnoses:  The clinical presentation  laboratory findings  positive blood cultures  and echocardiographic evidence supported a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion:  In retrospect  the patient's dental abscess and lack of prophylactic antibiotic treatment may have predisposed him to developing infective endocarditis. The patient had several risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease  including age  ethnicity  hypertension  and diabetes. These may have contributed to a heightened susceptibility to the effects of the infection on the heart valves.   In considering the demographic trends of infective endocarditis  this disease has been found to occur more commonly in males  individuals over the age of 60  and in those with a history of heart disease. It has also been associated with poor dental hygiene and invasive dental procedures. While race/ethnicity doesn't significantly impact the risk for endocarditis  comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension that are prevalent in Hispanic populations can compound the overall cardiovascular risk.  Treatment and prognosis will depend on the severity of the disease  the pathogen involved  and the patient's overall health. The treatment generally involves high-dose  long-term antibiotic therapy  and in some cases  surgery may be required to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,51,Patient Profile: Mr. A  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  works as a professional gardener  known for his meticulous attention to details whether pertaining to flora or his personal health. With a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  his cardiac prowess throws itself into scrutiny  warranting intervention. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic  maintaining a balanced diet and undertaking light physical activities.   Medical History: He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a decade ago  remaining well-controlled on Metformin. His father  late Mr. B  departed at 70 due to a myocardial infarction  hence a family history of cardiac illness is prevalent. His mother still flourishes with general age-related ailments at 87. There is no history of any major surgery or blood transfusion that Mr. A had to undergo.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. A presented to the practice with complaints of intermittent high grade fever  anorexia  weight loss and fatigue lasting for a month. On further probing  he affirmed the presence of night sweats and chills.  Examinations and Findings: Initial examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Ophthalmologic examination found the presence of Roth spots  suggestive of infective endocarditis. Janeway lesions and Osler’s nodes were absent.  Investigations: Blood tests revealed an elevated ESR (60mm/hr) and CRP (80mg/L). Full blood count was within normal range except for slightly raised white cell count (12 x10^9/L). Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram showed vegetations on the mitral valve.  Diagnosis: Considering the clinical presentation  examination findings and investigations  Mr. A was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management: Mr. A was promptly started on empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous vancomycin  following Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis  considering the severity of his presentation. Monitoring of blood culture results and echocardiography findings will follow.  Conclusion:  While Mr. A’s age and diabetes put him at higher risk for complications  early diagnosis and continued management could result in a favorable outcome. He will benefit from a multidisciplinary care approach including infectious disease specialists  cardiologists  and potentially  cardiothoracic surgeons. Amidst this  comprehensive patient education shall be emphasized  enumerating the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and recognizing early endocarditis symptoms to reduce chances of recurrence.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,52,Patient Information: Case Presentation: Mr. J  a 65-year-old African American male who lives alone in an urban area  was admitted to the hospital with a high-grade fever of 39.8°C  extreme fatigue  shortness of breath  and appetite loss. He has a BMI of 28 and is identified as a hypertensive and diabetic patient. Patients from African American descent have been associated with a higher risk for endocarditis due  among other factors  to higher rates of hypertension and diabetes.   Past Medical History: Patients' medical records show a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  with a recent HbA1c level at 8.5 percent. He also has hypertension  under control with lisinopril. He underwent dental cleaning about three weeks ago but failed to take his prescribed prophylactic antibiotic due to forgetting. He has no history of intravenous drug use or any other risky behavior  but he is a 10-pack-year smoker. He has a history of mitral valve prolapse  which makes him more susceptible to infective endocarditis.  Family History: Mr. J is a widower with no children. His parents are deceased. His father passed away in his late 80s because of complications related to Alzheimer's disease. His mother passed away in her 70s due to complications of heart disease. His older brother  aged 70  is living with prostate cancer  and his younger sister  aged 63  has type II diabetes and hypertension.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  Mr. J's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse 90 bpm  respirations 22/min  O2 saturation 92%  and weight 78 kg. Notable physical examination findings include pallor  mild pedal edema  and a pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. There were no Osler nodes  Roth spots  Janeway lesions  or splinter hemorrhages found  which are commonly associated with endocarditis. Laboratory investigations revealed increased ESR (54 mm/hr)  a high CRP level of 93.9 mg/L and WBC count (14 000/µL). Blood cultures were positive for Viridans Streptococci  which are often associated with infective endocarditis following dental procedures.  Diagnosis and Management: Based on the patient's symptoms  clinical findings  and the Duke Criteria for infective endocarditis  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made. He was started on empiric therapy with IV ceftriaxone and gentamicin  which was later adjusted based on his culture and sensitivity results. He was monitored with daily labs and EKGs to evaluate the effect of treatment and screen for potential complications. He declined cardiothoracic surgery consultation but chose to complete a six-week course of antibiotics.  Conclusion: This case is an example of the consequences of disregarding the recommended prophylactic measures in a patient with a clear predisposition for infective endocarditis. This reinforces the importance of preventative care  particularly in individuals with comorbidities that place them at higher risk for severe infections.   Reference:  Cahill TJ  Prendergast BD.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,53,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Patient """"X"""" is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired from a physically demanding labor job. He is a nonsmoker and a non-drinker  currently living alone. He has a BMI of 28  classifying him as overweight. The patient reports enjoying a diet high in red meats and processed foods. There is no history of illegal or recreational drug use.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes  which he manages with oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypertension managed by diet and exercise. No history of any surgical intervention is reported.  Presenting Complaint: He presented at the hospital with complaints of persistent fever  chills  fatigue  and a slight shortness of breath for the past fifteen days. There was no report of any chest pain or any other significant symptoms.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiac problems  with coronary heart disease being reported in his father  mother  and younger brother  who all passed away in their early 70s.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  he appeared ill  with noticeable weight loss and perspiration. There was noted pallor with icy cold hands. His heart exam revealed a new cardiac murmur suggestive of valvular disease  and Osler’s nodes were present on his fingers.  Diagnosis: Considering the clinical presentation  past medical history  and the classical physical findings  the patient was suspected to have a case of native-valve infective endocarditis  confirmed later by blood cultures and echocardiogram results which revealed vegetations on the native valves.  This case study serves as a typical representative of how Caucasian males in an older age group  particularly with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension  can become exposed to native-valve infective endocarditis  an infection of the endothelial surface of the heart. The history of consuming a diet high in red meats and processed foods  being overweight  and a strong family history of cardiac diseases further helped support this case.   The key to managing such conditions is early recognition to limit valve destruction and initiate proper treatment  which may involve antibiotics and possible surgical intervention. His strong family cardiac history and his personal history of comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension may make the patient's recovery more challenging."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,54,Patient Presentation  Patient Demographics: S.M. is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  hailing from a middle-class background. He is a non-smoker but has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. He is married with two grown children. According to U.S. health statistics  males  especially the Caucasian population aged 50-59  are at a slightly higher risk of endocarditis due to a combination of lifestyle and physiological factors.  Presenting Complaint: S.M. presented to the emergency department with a fever of 38.4°C  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  a new-onset cardiac murmur  and a red rash on his legs (Osler's nodes). These symptoms match the criteria for possible infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History: S.M. shares a history of type-2 diabetes and hypertension that has been managed effectively with metformin and hydrochlorothiazide  respectively  for the past 10 years. He also had a minor stroke five years ago  with no significant residue. S.M. also has mild renal impairment  which is monitored regularly.  Family History: Both of S.M's parents are deceased - mother due to breast cancer and father due to heart disease. S.M's sister has rheumatoid arthritis  and his brother has type-2 diabetes. His two children are both healthy adults.  Clinical Findings: Examination revealed pallor  Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions  night sweats  anemia  renal impairment  and inflammation of the heart on an electrocardiogram. Blood cultures tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus  confirming infective endocarditis. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiography supported the diagnosis revealing vegetations on the mitral valve.  Discussion: Given S.M.'s lifestyle choices  his hypertension  and diabetes  he had a predilection for developing native-valve endocarditis. His high blood pressure may damage the inner layer of his artery  making it easier for bacteria to attach and multiply there. Probably the bacteria entered his bloodstream during routine activities such as brushing or flossing since there was no record of a recent surgery or invasive medical procedure.   Management: S.M. is currently being treated with IV antibiotics in the hospital (vancomycin considering Staphylococcus aureus in culture and his renal impairment). He will also be closely monitored by the cardiology team for valve function and the neurology team for stroke risk. His diabetes will also be appropriately managed considering his current health status. He may eventually require mitral valve replacement if there's no improvement on antibiotics.  S.M's case demonstrates the necessity of careful monitoring and management of patients with multiple comorbidities  as complications from one condition can give rise to other severe health problems.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,55,Patient Presentation:   We present the case of a 55-year-old Hispanic male  Mr. J Rodriguez  who was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE). The patient works as a school janitor and lives in an urban average-income neighborhood in California. He is married  a father of two  and lives with his wife and children.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez had been previously managed for type 2 diabetes mellitus for about six years and has a history of substance abuse in his mid-20s that includes cocaine use. However  he has been clean for nearly 30 years. He successfully completed rehab and maintained complete abstinence from illicit substances. He was a smoker throughout his 20s and has quit  but was recently diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by his primary care physician.   Family History:  Mr. Rodriguez's family history includes a father who suffered from coronary artery disease and passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Rodriguez’s mother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His younger brother has been managing hyperlipidemia and hypertension.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with a one-week history of high-grade fever  malaise  night sweats  anorexia  unintentional weight loss  and heart palpitations. The fever failed to recede despite a week of antibiotics administered by his primary care physician.  Investigation:  In line with his symptoms  a blood culture was ordered  which revealed Streptococcus oralis  confirming a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram further showed the presence of large vegetations on the native mitral valve  supporting the initial diagnosis.  Treatment Plan:  The Infectious Diseases Society of America's (IDSA) guideline for NVE was followed for Mr. Rodriguez. Antibiotic therapy was initiated as recommended by IDSA guidelines along with supportive care for fever and related symptoms. Given the location and size of the vegetations  in consultation with the cardiothoracic surgery team  a decision was taken against early surgical intervention.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis primarily affects the vegetation of heart valves  commonly affecting individuals with pre-existing heart diseases. Hispanic males above 50  particularly those with diabetes and histories of substance abuse  are at a higher risk  confirming the literature references. It's essential to consider patients' socio-demographic factors when diagnosing and managing NVE as earlier intervention significantly reduces morbidity and mortality.  This case underscores the importance of vigilant clinical assessment and aggressive therapeutic management in patients at high risk for NVE. A detailed and pertinent history is essential for leading clinicians toward the correct diagnosis  which in this case was influenced by the patient's demographic representation  past medical history  family history  and presenting complaints.   The patient's treatment was tailored to his medical history and current clinical status. Regular and detailed follow-up visits were planned  considering the chronicity of the disease process and the risk of potential complications. The patient  his spouse  and his wider family were also educated about the disease  its treatment  and prognosis to ensure compliance and follow-up.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,56,Case Presentation  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 75-year-old African-American male  consistent with literature which suggests a higher prevalence of endocarditis amongst older adults and African Americans. He resides in an urban setting and lives with his wife of 45 years. He is a retired engineer and has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. He has no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. His BMI is 29  pointing to overweight issue  but not to the point of obesity.  Past Medical History:  His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension  managed primarily through Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. The patient's hypertension is likely contributory to the heart valve pathology sought to be a source of his endocarditis.   Evaluation:  The patient came with a one-month history of low-grade fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. On physical examination  he had Janeway lesions on his palms and soles as well as Osler nodes on his fingers. The oral examination further revealed poor dental hygiene with multiple untreated caries- a common source of bacteria causing infective endocarditis. Pertinent laboratory findings include raised ESR and CRP levels  mild anemia  and evidence of microhematuria on urinalysis. Further blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus  a common pathogen in native-valve infectious endocarditis.  Diagnostic Confirmation:  An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. There was also evidence of moderate mitral regurgitation.  Management:  The patient is currently under treatment with intravenous antibiotics as per Infective Endocarditis in Adults: Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines from the American Heart Association.  Family History:  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother had a stroke at 68. His elder sister is being treated for congestive heart failure.  This case underscores the importance of prompt recognition and management of infective endocarditis in the face of known risks such as poor oral hygiene and hypertension and the heightened risk factor considering the strong familial predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.  The patient’s ongoing management strategy will involve monitoring the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment  managing his underlying comorbidities (Diabetes  Hypertension) and considering a possible mitral valve replacement surgery given the signs of moderate mitral regurgitation caused by the vegetation. Further  addressing his poor oral hygiene is critical to prevent a potential future re-infection.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,57,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Thomas Reed  65-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: General weakness  fever  sweating  and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mr. Reed has a history of IV drug abuse in his early twenties but has been clean for several decades. He has been on management for hypertension for the last 10 years and is a 20-pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago  with fairly good control. Additionally  he had a heart attack in his early sixties  for which he received percutaneous coronary intervention and stents placement. He has no known allergies.  Family History: Mr. Reed's father had a history of heart disease and died of a heart attack at an early age. His mother had hypertension and diabetes  and she died of a stroke. His sister  60  is diabetic and on chronic medication for hypertension.  Presenting Complaint: He initially developed generalized malaise two weeks ago which progressed to intermittent fever  sweating  and increasing weakness. He stated he has been feeling unusually tired and short of breath even on mild exertion. He has noticed that he has lost some weight recently  though he hasn’t been trying  and has noticed a decreased appetite. His wife noticed that his palms have become redder.  Physical Examination: Fever was noted (101.1 F). The patient looked acutely ill and was sweating. Auscultation revealed a new cardiac murmur. Additionally  a few petechiae were seen on the skin  and the extremities were cool to touch. Pulses were slightly irregular.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood tests revealed a high white cell count and raised inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR). Three sets of blood cultures were taken. Echocardiogram showed vegetations on the mitral valve indicating native-valve infective endocarditis  which corresponds with his presenting symptoms. Blood cultures further confirmed growth of Staphylococcus aureus  consistent with infective endocarditis. An abdominal ultrasound showed mild splenomegaly.  Patient Progress and Treatment: The patient was immediately commenced on IV antibiotics based on initial culture results (modified later as per culture sensitivity reports)  and cardiology was consulted for potential surgical treatment. The patient was educated on the importance of dental hygiene and to avoid any procedures that could lead to an infection henceforth due to his newfound risk for repeated endocarditis incidents.  Summary: This reinforces that patients with drug abuse history  despite prolonged abstinence  retain the vulnerability for infective endocarditis. It underlines the importance of routine dental care & avoidance of procedures that can lead to infections in these individuals due to this enhanced risk.

The data provided is meant to provide an example of how a medical professional might approach an actual patient's case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,58,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 63-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of nighttime sweats  fatigue  weight loss  and an intermittent high-grade fever. He works as a janitor and reports having no recent travel history or significant exposures.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had been a smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history but quit 15 years prior. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and a short-acting bronchodilator. He reports non-compliance to medications due to financial constraints. He has no history of intravenous drug use or known exposure to tuberculosis.   Family History:   His mother died at the age of 72 due to complications from stroke  and his father died at the age of 75 due to heart failure. He has two sisters who are living and healthy  one with type 2 diabetes. He has no known family history of endocarditis.   Physical Examination:   Upon examination  he is fatigued and febrile with a temperature of 39°C. Other vital signs include a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a mildly tachycardic rate of 105 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Cardiovascular exam reveals a new  harsh  pansystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. There were no stigmata of endocarditis found on skin or eye exam. The rest of the physical examination  including lung auscultation  abdominal exam  and neurological examination  are within normal limits.   Investigations and Diagnosis:   Lab findings showed hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dl  white cell count of 15 000 microliter  and platelets of 400 000 microliter. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridians. Chest X-Ray was unremarkable. An ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no arrhythmia or signs of ischemia. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a large  mobile echodensity on the mitral valve consistent with vegetation.  The patient’s clinical presentation  blood cultures  and the presence of new murmur  met the criteria for Duke's definitive diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   Course of Treatment:  The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics based on sensitivity testing  after which he showed some improvement in his general condition. Surgical consult recommended mitral valve replacement once the infection was controlled. The patient's social circumstances and medication compliance issues were noted and addressed by the healthcare team and social services.  This case reflects the demographics found in existing literature  as infective endocarditis is more common in men than women  and African Americans have a higher prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. The case also accurately describes common symptoms  as well as diagnostic and treatment procedures for infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,59,Patient Presentation:  Subject Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years old Occupation: Retired Race: Caucasian Sex: Male  Demographics: Mr. Doe hails from a suburban community in the Midwest  United States. As a retiree  he enjoys a quiet life with his wife of 40 years. He has three adult children  none of whom have medical conditions related to infective endocarditis. None of them has had any form of congenital heart disease  connective tissue disease  or intravenous (IV) drug use that is known to increase the risk of the condition.   Past Medical History: Upon detailed medical history taking  it was found that Mr. Doe had a medical background of Rheumatic Heart Disease during his late childhood years. He also had mild hypertension managed with low-dose thiazide diuretic which has remained under control. No history of diabetes or other autoimmune diseases. Prior to the current episode  his last hospital admission was over 20 years ago for appendectomy. He has no history of IV drug use  blood transfusions  recent dental procedures  or recent travel history.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Doe presented at the hospital with symptoms including fever of 38.6°C and severe fatigue persisting for two weeks. He also complained about weight loss  night sweats  and occasional shortness of breath on exertion. Further examination revealed a new heart murmur that had not been noted previously  along with petechiae in his conjunctiva and lower extremities.  Diagnostic Evaluation: With the given history and clinical findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was suspected. Blood cultures tested positive for Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram revealed aortic valve vegetations  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis per the modified Duke Criteria.  Treatment Plan: Mr. Doe was immediately started on culture-specific IV antibiotics. Close monitoring of his cardiac function and clinical status was done. An interprofessional team approach was taken for his case  involving a cardiologist  infectious disease specialist  and a dietician.  Discussion: While he lacks the most common risk factors for infective endocarditis – IV drug use  prosthetic heart valves or cardiac implants  immunosuppression – Mr. Doe does have a history of rheumatic heart disease which damages heart valves and can predispose to future infections. Thus  the case highlights the importance of systemic assessment  clinical vigilance  and long-term follow up of at-risk populations such as those with a history of rheumatic heart disease.  Differential Diagnoses:  Atypical pneumonia  Tuberculosis  Leukemia  Lymphoma  HIV  Prognosis: With timely IV antibiotics and supportive care  Mr. Doe is expected to have a favorable prognosis. However  potential complications like heart failure  septicemia and systemic emboli need to be monitored closely. Chronic monitoring of cardiac function and prophylactic measures are paramount given his history of rheumatic heart disease.   Patient education regarding the need for regular follow ups and timely reporting of symptoms  especially before any surgical or dental procedures is necessary. This case study emphasizes the consideration of infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with vague prolonged febrile illnesses  especially in the setting of prior heart disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,60,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Initials: A.B. Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Chief Complaint: A.B. presents with symptoms of fatigue  fever  decreased appetite  and weight loss for the past couple of weeks.   Past Medical History: A.B. has a history of intermittent heart murmurs  was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse 3 years ago. However  he refused prophylaxis after being educated about the risk of endocarditis. He also has a 10-year history of Type II diabetes mellitus  managing it with lifestyle modifications and medication. A.B. has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years  consuming alcohol occasionally.  Family History: The patient's mother suffered from rheumatic heart disease and his father died of a myocardial infarction.   Social History: A.B. lives alone in a suburban area. He is a widower with two adult children who live out of state. His financial situation is stable.  Physical Examination: A.B.'s vital signs were stable except for a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F). Cardiac auscultation revealed a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur. He showed signs of conjunctival pallor and splinter hemorrhages were seen under the nails.  Diagnostic Tests: Lab tests revealed the presence of anemia and high ESR. A positive blood culture for Streptococcus viridans was obtained  indicating an ongoing bacterial infection. EKG showed irregular heart rhythm. Echocardiography confirmed the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve  consistent with infective endocarditis.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical symptoms  lab findings  and imaging data  A.B. was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Discussion: Infective endocarditis is more common in males and people over 60. A.B.'s pre-existing heart condition (mitral valve prolapse)  diabetes  and lifestyle behavior (smoking) put him at higher risk. The patient's refusal of prophylaxis after the initial diagnosis of mitral valve issue has also contributed to the current infection.  Plan: A.B's treatment plan includes hospitalization and administration of intravenous antibiotics for 4-6 weeks. Patient education regarding the importance of medication compliance will also be given due emphasis. Considering his smoking history  counseling for smoking cessation will also be initiated. A dietitian will be consulted for diet modification to manage both endocarditis and diabetes.  Educating A.B. about the criticality of his condition and the possible complications  including heart failure  stroke  and the necessity of heart valve surgery  is essential to ensure he understands the importance of following medical advice.  Follow-up: After completion of the antibiotic treatment  A.B. is to be closely followed up to assess for symptom relief and echocardiograph improvement. Regular check-ups are also crucial to control diabetes and monitor for potential cardiac complications.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,61,Patient Presentation  Subject: An 60-year-old African-American male  Medical history: Hypertensive and smoker for the past 20 years. No prior known cardiac disease. Noncompliant with antihypertensive medications. Last known visit to a healthcare provider was three years ago.  Family history: His father died of myocardial infarction at age 65. Mother has hypertension and diabetes. Sibling has a history of stroke.  Presenting Complaint: He presented at the emergency department  reporting two weeks of persistent fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath  especially on exertion  and nocturnal sweating.  Physical Examination Findings: Examination revealed the patient's blood pressure to be 155/95 mmHg  a heart rate of 90/min  and a temperature of 38.5°C. The patient demonstrated a cardiac murmur suggestive of valve disease  and small  flat  painless spots (Janeway Lesions) noted on the palms and soles.  Investigations: Blood cultures returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation  diagnostic of endocarditis.  Management: The patient was admitted for in-patient management - intravenous antibiotics with nafcillin and gentamicin were administered for six weeks. His blood pressure management was optimized with the introduction of an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.  Discussion: The patient is a perfect representation of a demographic group that presents a high risk for developing native-valve infective endocarditis due to several factors  including his age  race  longstanding untreated hypertension  smoking habits  and noncompliance with medical treatment for blood pressure. His delayed presentation is typical and contributed to the established severe mitral valve damage and systemic manifestations seen on admission.  Native-valve Infective Endocarditis remains a significant health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality. Its diagnosis can be challenging due to its protean manifestations  but a strong index of suspicion in high-risk groups can lead to prompt diagnosis and management. Coupled with the need for patients to adhere to their medication regimens and a more regular follow-up to monitor their chronic conditions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,62,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with complaints of fever  fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and night sweats for the past three weeks. He has a past medical history of Stage 2 hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also reported a recent dental procedure completed a month ago without pre-medication. He is not currently on any immunosuppressant drugs. The patient lives with his wife  is retired  and they both enjoy gardening.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with high blood pressure at the age of 52 years and later diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around the age of 60 years. He has been well managed on Metformin 1000mg twice daily and Lisinopril 20mg once daily. He has no history of previous surgeries or known allergies. He does not smoke  has an occasional alcohol intake  and denies use of illegal substances.  Family History:  His father had a history of heart disease and succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 years. His mother is 85 years old and has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. His two siblings are alive and well  with the older brother having diabetes.  Presenting Issue:  Clinical investigations revealed the patient has a slightly elevated white blood cell count  blood cultures yielded Streptococcus viridans  and an echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. He was started on appropriate antibiotics.  The lack of premedication prior to a tooth extraction may have led to the spread of bacteria to the heart causing endocarditis. His comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes) may have heightened his risk for infection.  Plan:  The patient is admitted for inpatient care to monitor and manage his condition. He will be given a course of intravenous antibiotics and undergo regular echocardiograms to monitor the status of the heart valves. Lifestyle modifications will be suggested and the importance of preventative oral care and pre-medication before dental procedures will be emphasized.  Discussion:  The demographic of the patient  Caucasian male  age above 60 years  co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes  aligns with what is often reported in literature for patients with native-valve infective endocarditis. Factors such as dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotics and poor glycemic control can increase the risk for this infection. This case underscores the importance of proper dental care and use of prophylactic antibiotics in individuals with risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,63,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male named Mr. J  coming from the inner city of Chicago. This demographic group is likely to have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases. Mr. J was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He has a past history of IV drug abuse  which is a common risk factor for this condition. His drug usage was comparatively higher than most cases  significantly increasing his chances.   Mr. J was clinically obese (BMI 30.5) and has a history of rheumatic heart disease  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  poorly managed over the years. The chronic disorders might have damaged the valves of his heart  making him susceptible to infective endocarditis.   Family History  Mr. J family history reveals that his father died of heart attack at age 56 and his mother was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes  both of which could be associated with increased genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease. An important aspect is that Mr. J’s younger brother also had a history of substance abuse  however his drugs of choice were alcohol and cigarettes  and due to multiple public intoxication offenses  he also presented with a legal history.   Health Behaviors  Mr. J is a smoker  smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years  exacerbating his condition. Unfortunately  Mr. J also has a poor nutritional habit; he often eats fast food  attributing his obesity and poor diabetic control.   Recent Problems  Three weeks ago  Mr. J had symptoms similar to a common flu  such as fever  fatigue  muscle ache  and night sweats but did not seek immediate medical attention. However  recently he has been experiencing severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath. His neighbor found him unconscious in his house  so he was immediately rushed to our emergency department.   On physical examination  he had a high fever  elevated blood pressure  and a new murmur was detected upon cardiac auscultation  raising the suspicion of infective endocarditis. The lab results  including a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus and his echocardiogram showing vegetation on his mitral valve  confirmed our diagnosis.   Conclusion   Mr. J’s case is a textbook presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis resulting from IV drug abuse  chronic health conditions  and negative health behaviors like smoking and poor diet. His delayed treatment led to a complicated medical situation. His condition has improved after undergoing valve replacement surgery and multi-drug antibiotic therapy  highlighting the need for immediate attention and action when facing symptomatic complaints  and the crucial role of lifestyle choices in managing health conditions. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,64,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 57-year-old Caucasian male from Charleston  South Carolina  presented with a 3-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  and malaise  showing classical signs of an infection. He denies any history of intravenous drug use  recent dental procedures  or signs of septicemia. He resides in a suburban area with his wife and works as a carpenter. He has been a smoker for 35 years  averaging one pack per day. He occasionally drinks alcohol on weekends. His diet consists predominantly of fast foods  due to hectic work schedules.   Past Medical History:  He has a known history of mild hypertension  diagnosed five years ago  which is controlled on medication (Lisinopril 10 mg/day). He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus three years ago and is on Metformin (500mg twice daily). He has a history of Rheumatic fever during his childhood  though he did not have any valve abnormalities prior to this admission.  Family History:  Regarding family medical history  his mother had Hypertension and died of a stroke at 72  and his father battled lung cancer and passed away at 66.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe came to the clinic with chief complaints of fever  night sweats  and malaise which did not improve with over-the-counter medications. He had felt a general weakness and decreased productivity at work. He noticed some unexplained weight loss but wrote it off due to his intense work. On physical examination  he had an irregular pulse rate  and a systolic murmur was evident on auscultation.  Investigations:  His lab reports showed increased ESR  CRP  and the presence of anemia. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans  suggesting infective endocarditis. An echocardiography revealed vegetations on the native valve confirming the diagnosis - native valve infective endocarditis.  Management Plan:  Following the guideline-based strategy  he was promptly initiated on antibiotic therapy with Penicillin G and Gentamicin to target the identified organisms. This treatment regime is planned for up to 6 weeks  according to the AHA’s guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis.  Summary:  Mr. Doe's occupation as a carpenter and his lifestyle habits  including long-term smoking and unhealthy diet  contribute to his overall medium-to-high risk profile. He already had pre-existing conditions - Hypertension and Diabetes. Patients with Diabetes tend to have a higher risk of infections and complications. His past history of Rheumatic fever brings out susceptibility towards cardiac issues and further complicated by his age. His family history also indicates a possible predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.   His clinical presentation  test findings  and the identification of Streptococcus viridans lead to a confirmed diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  which appears to be a complication of his past rheumatic fever and acerbated by his diabetic condition. Presently  efforts are on to treat the infection aggressively to prevent complications like congestive heart failure and septicemia.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,65,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 57-year-old African-American male with past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well-controlled with Metformin  and Mild Hypertension  managed by dietary changes. He has been admitted to the hospital with complaints of persistent fatigue  intermittent fever  and weight loss for the past few weeks.   Social History: The patient is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. He is employed as a carpenter and lives with his wife and three adult children. No history of illicit drug use or recent travel.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and mother had stroke. No immediate family history of heart valve disorders  rheumatic heart disease  or other cardiac diseases.  Clinical Findings: On examination  he was noted to have a new systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Also  petechiae were observable on the conjunctiva  palate  and over the upper extremities. Further investigations were prompted in view of these findings and his symptoms.  Investigations: His CBC showed moderate anemia with a Hb of 8.7g/dl  WBC count of 12000/mm3  predominantly neutrophils  and an ESR of 75mm/hr. His blood sugars were well controlled  renal parameters were within the normal range  lipid profile showed borderline high LDL and normal HDL. 3 sets of blood cultures were sent and he was started on empirical antibiotic treatment and underwent Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The TEE demonstrated a vegetation on the atrial aspect of the mitral valve.  Hospital Course: Blood culture results showed growth of Streptococcus viridans  sensitive to Penicillin. Antibiotic therapy was deescalated to Intravenous Penicillin and the patient showed significant improvement with these interventions.  Diagnosis: Based on the positive blood culture finding confirming bacteremia  the TEE findings and his clinical presentation  a diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans was made.  Prognosis: He has been counseled regarding the seriousness of his condition  the need for long-term antibiotic therapy  and the possible need for surgical intervention if medical management fails. Risk factors for morbidity include his co-existing conditions of diabetes and hypertension which can complicate management and recovery.  This case is representative of clinical presentations commonly encountered with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. Due consideration has been given to his demographic  occupation  and past medical history as these factors could contribute to his disease development and progression. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,66,Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presenting from his home. He has been retired for two years and lived alone since the passing of his wife about three years ago. He is not an avid smoker nor does he drink alcohol. He used to work in a factory that exposed him to mercury and lead among other elements contrastingly high to average.  Past Medical History: The patient had been diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) in his early 40s. He has been on prophylactic antibiotics (Penicillin) since his diagnosis to prevent streptococcal infections. Furthermore  he has suffered from Diabetes Mellitus type II and hypertension for 15 years. He is under regular medication for his conditions including Metformin  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers. There is no history of recent dental procedures  or any other invasive interventions. He has not had any blood transfusions in the past.  Family History: Both his parents had died of heart disease; a myocardial infarction for his father and heart failure for his mother. The paternal side of his family also has a noted history of RHD. On the maternal side  his mother had type II Diabetes Melitus. He has two siblings  a sister who suffers from hypertension and a brother who is healthy.  Presenting Complaints: The patient visited the clinic with the principal complaint of high fever (38.5-degree Celsius)  persistent fatigue  unintended weight loss  night sweats and slight breathlessness on exertion  for a period of last 4 to 5 weeks. On further investigation  he also reported experiencing a periodic and sudden change in vision  accompanied by a headache.  Physical Examination: On auscultation  a murmur was detected suggestive of aortic valve damage. He had some petechial rashes on his chest and conjunctival hemorrhages. The peripheral pulses were unequal  and rapid. There was no noted clubbing  pallor  jaundice  or lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination remained non-significant.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood culture has been carried out due to suspicion of Infective Endocarditis  which subsequently revealed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The echocardiogram revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on aortic valve consistent with vegetation. His blood glucose level was high  suggesting the need for further management of diabetes. His ECG showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no acute ischemia.  Treatment: The patient was commenced on intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamycin to manage the infective endocarditis. His diabetes medicine was adjusted to cope with his current blood glucose levels. He was admitted to the hospital for careful monitoring and frequent evaluation of his vitals and overall health.  Conclusion: This clinical scenario is a classical presentation of a subacute native-valve infective endocarditis in an older male patient. The bacterial infection was likely secondary to his pre-existing heart condition - RHD. This case further emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of infective endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease  to prevent potential lethal complications. Sustained efforts should be focused on monitoring and managing his co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension that may further complicate his case. His family history and previous workplace exposure should not be ignored as potential risk factors. This patient requires error-prone antibiotic therapy  as well as a comprehensive plan for long-term care and lifestyle modification advice.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,67,Subject: Case Presentation: 68-year-old Male Patient Diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presented to a community hospital emergency department with fatigue  low-grade fever  and a new murmur on the cardiac exam. He denies any recent history of dental procedures  intravenous drug use  or any skin infections. He resides in a suburban area and lives with his wife.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10 mg daily and Atorvastatin 20 mg daily  respectively). He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years prior with no postoperative complications. He does not have any known allergies. He does not smoke  occasionally consumes alcohol  and has no history of illicit drug usage.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and passed away in his 70s due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother died of a stroke at the age of 81. His elder sister is currently battling breast cancer. There are no known familial forms of congenital heart diseases in the family.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient appeared fatigued but was otherwise in no acute distress. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.2°C  blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  pulse rate 90/min  and respiratory rate of 18/min. Cardiac examination revealed a new grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the apex  moving to the axilla. There were no visible skin lesions  such as Osler nodes or Janeway lesions  nor were there splinter hemorrhages on the nails. His abdomen was soft and non-tender.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood cultures were obtained  and the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed a vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. Cultures showed positivity for Streptococcus viridans.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was started on empirical antibiotics upon admission based on clinical suspicion. After culture sensitivity results  the antibiotics were adjusted to high-dose penicillin G combined with gentamicin. The patient responded well to this antibiotic regimen. He showed considerable improvement with resolution of fever  and repeat blood cultures were negative. He was discharged after six weeks of treatment and is being regularly followed up in the cardiology outpatient department.  This case presentation is representative of the demographic and clinical profile of native-valve infective endocarditis. It highlights the importance of early suspicion and investigation in patients with a new murmur and nonspecific symptoms  particularly in those with a history of heart disease.  References: Patients with native-valve infective endocarditis have been widely studied  and this presentation is consistent with the epidemiology and symptomatology reported in literature. The case reflects the common bacterial pathogens involved and the treatment approach typically used.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,68,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 65-year-old African-American male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. This individual has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled with medication  a 20-year pack history of smoking  and moderate alcohol consumption. He denies IV drug use. His family history is remarkable for a mother who suffered a stroke at the age of 72 and a father who died from myocardial infarction in his 60s. His sister  who is in her fifties now  has type 2 diabetes. There is no family history of rheumatologic disease or other heart-related conditions.  The patient presented to the emergency department with persistent fever for one week  malaise  and a new-onset murmur heard at the left lower sternal border. Decreased breath sounds in the left lung were noted on the physical examination. Notoriously  he additionally reported unplanned weight loss for the last two months  night sweats  joint pain  and previously unexperienced episodes of shortness of breath.   A complete blood count showed leukocytosis—17 000/uL with 90% neutrophils—and an elevated C-reactive protein level was noted. Blood cultures were also drawn at the time of evaluation  which latter showed gram-positive cocci in clusters  consistent with Staphylococcus aureus.   An echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic valve regurgitation with large vegetations on the cusps of the aortic valve  suggesting the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The lung examination and hypoxemia signs might pointed out to septic emboli.  During his course of hospitalization  our patient needed further diagnostic procedures and aggressive treatment with antibiotics. He was also assessed for surgical intervention for valve replacement due to his heart failure symptoms and large vegetation size.   Management of his condition was challenging given his past medical history and lifestyle risk factors. A multi-disciplinary approach was adopted  involving cardiology  cardiothoracic surgery  and infectious diseases.  This case remains central in considering the high-risk population susceptible to developing infective endocarditis  especially among elderly African-American males who smoke  consume alcohol  and have hypertension.   Conclusion: Elderly patients with a history of smoking  alcohol consumption  and hypertension may be at a higher risk for developing native valve infective endocarditis. Of note  these individuals may not always have classical features  such as IV drug use or a previous history of rheumatic heart disease. Continued vigilance is needed to diagnose and manage individuals like our patient successfully.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,69,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J.D.  who presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent low-grade fever for a month  malaise  loss of appetite and a weight loss of about 8 pounds. He also reports dyspnea and occasional nocturnal dry cough. The patient lives with his wife in a small suburban home  and they do not have any pets. He is retired and previously worked as a plumber for 20 years.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J.D. has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he uses Salbutamol inhalation occasionally. He has hypertension and dyslipidemia  both well-controlled with Amlodipine 5mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily. He also has a history of occasional alcohol consumption  but he quit smoking ten years ago.  Family History:  In addition  there is a notable family history of heart disease; his father died from an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 67  and his older brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. His mother is alive and well at 85 with a history of osteoarthritis and hypertension. He has a younger sister with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Findings on Examination:  On physical exam  he appeared exhausted and in discomfort. His vital signs were as follows: temperature of 100.3°F  heart rate of 96 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 bpm  blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed a new-onset grade 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Further systematic examination revealed occasional inspiratory crackles in the right lower bronchial region and mild peripheral edema.  Investigation Results:  Laboratory investigations showed elevated ESR and CRP levels. His blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  consistent with the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography revealed moderate aortic regurgitation with vegetation on the aortic valve.  Treatment Plan:  He has been admitted to the cardiology department for further management. Antimicrobial therapy was started as per the Infectious Diseases Society of America's (IDSA) guidelines for IE  including Ceftriaxone and Gentamycin. His condition is being carefully monitored due to the added risk factors of COPD and heart disease. A multidisciplinary team  including cardiology  infectious disease  and internal medicine specialists  is involved in his care.  Follow-up:  Mr. J.D. will continue to be monitored closely for response to the antimicrobial regimen  and changes will be made as necessary. Depending on the progression of his condition  surgical intervention may be needed. His COPD and hypertension management will be optimized to avoid further complications. He will also be referred to a dietary and fitness regimen to improve his overall health. His family members will be encouraged to get screened for heart disease  considering the significant family history.   This case illustrates the complexity of managing an older adult with multiple comorbidities presenting with infective endocarditis  necessitating a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,70,Patient Presentation:  Background Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired schoolteacher. He has a known past medical history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)  hypertension  and type II diabetes. The patient is a non-smoker  with a moderate alcohol intake. His mother reportedly died from stroke at 70  and a brother has been recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Apart from the MVP  there is no family history of congenital heart disease. The patient currently lives with his wife and has three adult children  all in good health.  Recent Health Status: Three weeks prior to presentation  the patient had a minor dental procedure conducted and experienced unremitting fever which ranged between 38 - 39°C accompanied by fatigue and significant weight loss. There was no history of illicit drug use or recent travel.  Physical examination: On presentation  the patient was febrile and had peripheral manifestations of endocarditis including Janeway lesions  splinter hemorrhages under the fingernails  and Osler's nodes. Heart auscultation revealed a new systolic murmur indicative of mitral regurgitation.  Investigations: Lab results include white blood cells of 15 000/uL  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 75mm/hr  C-reactive protein (CRP) of 90mg/L. Blood culture yielded Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram displayed vegetations on the mitral valve and worsening of mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis: The patient  thus  was diagnosed with infective endocarditis affecting the native mitral valve. Given his recent dental procedure and the culture results showing Streptococcus viridans  it can be deduced that the dental procedure might have triggered the bacteremia and subsequent colonization of the already susceptible mitral valve due to the MVP.  Plan: The patient was started on a 6-week course of intravenous penicillin  which is bactericidal to Streptococcus species. Gentamicin is also added for the initial two weeks to target a possible drug-resistant phenotype and for its synergistic effect alongside penicillin. Surgical evaluation for mitral valve repair or replacement would be necessitated if the patient shows signs of heart failure  persistent infection despite appropriate antibiotics or recurrent emboli. Education is also provided to the patient about the need for prophylactic antibiotics before future dental procedures.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing dental or other procedures that could lead to transient bacteremia  especially in those with a known risk factor for endocarditis like mitral valve prolapse. It is essential for clinicians to be vigilant and catch the first signs of this grave yet treatable disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,71,Patient Presentation  Patient: Mr. Garcia  a 64-year-old Hispanic man.   Presenting complaint: Reported to the emergency department with a three-week history of fatigue  mild fever  weight loss  and occasional night sweats.  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has a history of type II diabetes  for which he takes Metformin. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years ago but has had controlled blood pressure since then. He occasionally uses over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for arthritis pain.  Social History: Mr. Garcia is a retired office worker  lives independently  and does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He consumes alcohol in moderation and does not have a known history of intravenous drug use. His only travels were within the United States.   Family history: His mother had type II diabetes  his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his only sibling has hypertension.  Examination & Results: On physical examination  the patient seemed cachectic. His temperature was mildly elevated (99.8°F). Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic murmur. Blood investigations showed mild anemia and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. His kidney and liver function tests were normal. Blood cultures taken were positive for Staphylococcus aureus.   Further Findings: Upon suspicion of infective endocarditis  a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed  which reported a vegetative growth on the native mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Progress & Follow-up: The patient was immediately started on proper antibiotics and referred to a cardiologist for further consideration of surgery. Mr. Garcia's family was informed of his condition and the importance of immediate and regular follow-up.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis  although rare  is more common among older males and more prevalent among the Hispanic population. Key risk factors include heart valve diseases  intravenous drug abuse  and a history of invasive procedures. In this case  Mr. Garcia's poor diabetic control might have predisposed him to this infection in the absence of other common risk factors. The late presentation is typical  as the initial symptoms are non-specific  often leading to diagnostic delay.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,72,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presents with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  shortness of breath  and palpitations.   Medical History  He has a past medical history notable for intravenous drug use (IVDU) which ended fifteen years ago and poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He does not exercise regularly and his diet predominantly consists of high carbohydrate foods.  Family History  The patient’s family history is significant for heart disease. His father passed away at the age of 62 due to a myocardial infarction. The patient’s mother is alive and well  aged 87.   Presenting Complaint  Now he reports a feeling of """"pounding in his chest"""" along with extreme fatigue. He reports recurrent bouts of nocturnal sweat with a low-grade fever over the same period as well. He has developed dyspnea  initially on exertion  which has progressively worsened to being at rest. The patient also has been losing weight over the past few weeks despite no changes in diet or activity levels.  Clinical Findings  Physical examination reveals the patient to be in mild distress  with a temperature of 38.5 C  pulse of 104/min  blood pressure of 123/82 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 18/min  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed an early diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border and the presence of Janeway's lesions were noted in the patient's palms. Chest auscultation revealed bibasilar crackles.  Clinical Status and Diagnosis  Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. An ECG showed tachycardia without signs of ischemia. An echocardiogram revealed the presence of a mobile echogenic mass attached to the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation  consistent with infective endocarditis (IE).  Treatment  The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and vancomycin  in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Plans have been made for potential cardiac surgery  in case of failure of antibiotic therapy or in the presence of life-threatening complications.  Conclusion  This case highlights a presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis  a serious complication associated with increased cardiac mortality. This patient’s history of IVDU coupled with poor diabetes control likely put him at greater risk for the development of IE. A multidisciplinary approach is required to manage such cases optimally."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,73,Patient Overview:   Mr. J  a 73-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  presents to the emergency department with symptoms of high-grade fever  chills  weakness  unintentional weight loss  and night sweats for two weeks. No known drug allergies  a non-smoker  and social alcohol use only.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin and diet. Additionally  the patient had recently been treated for Staphylococcus aureus related skin infection six months ago. No history of surgeries or hav ing any intravascular devices. No previous hospitalizations.  Family History:  Mr. J's mother had died of stroke in her late 70s  and his father had a history of cardiac issues. There are no instances of endocarditis or similar heart disorders in his immediate or extended family.  Clinical Findings:  Physical exam revealed a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 bpm  temperature of 38.5°C (febrile)  and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Findings from a cardiac examination were notable for a new-onset murmur over the apex of the heart. Lab findings included leukocytosis  slightly decreased hemoglobin  positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR  CRP).  Diagnostic Assessment:  Considering the clinical and lab findings  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis likely secondary to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This was confirmed on Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) that demonstrated vegetations on the mitral valve.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on empirical treatment including intravenous (IV) vancomycin and gentamicin  according to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for Staphylococcal infective endocarditis.  Prognosis:  Despite the serious nature of the condition  with prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy  the prognosis can be favorable. However  in some cases  it may require valve replacement surgery. Due to his age and co-morbid conditions  there is potential for complications. The patient and his family were counseled about the condition  likely prognosis  and intended management approach.  Epidemiological data indicates that infective endocarditis is more prevalent in older adults  males  those with diabetes  IV drug users  and individuals with a previous history of a similar condition. Mr. J fits into the first two high-risk demographic categories; these factors along with the skin infection might have made a him prime candidate for such an infection.  This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients presenting with fever of unknown origin  especially in those with a relevant demographic and clinical history  as swift diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,74,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 54-year-old African American male carpenter  living in urban United States. He presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of fever  malaise  and arthralgias  weight loss of about eight pounds  loss of appetite  and night sweats. He denies chest pain  dyspnea  cough  or other respiratory symptoms  changes in bowel habits  or recent travel.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  chronic untreated Hepatitis C acquired during his substance abuse era  and has been abstinent from intravenous drugs in recent years. His diabetic condition is currently controlled through diet and Metformin. He mentions that he has not received regular dental care  and his dental hygiene was poor until his recent health concerns.  Family History: No significant family history of cardiac  kidney  or liver diseases. His mother had hypertension. He has one sister who is alive and well. His father died of lung cancer related to smoking.  Physical Examination: Upon evaluation  the patient seems in slight distress due to the discomfort from recent onset back pain. He is febrile (38.5 Degrees Celsius)  blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg  heart rate of 85 bpm  Body Mass Index (BMI) is 27  and Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 96% on room air. He appears to have poor dentition  including visible tooth decay.  Blood examination reveals slight leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP  indicative of an ongoing inflammatory process. His previous lab works show mild renal functioning affected which could be consulted if patient requires any invasive procedure in the future.  Diagnosis and Management: The combination of persistent fever  weight loss  malaise  night sweats and the cardiac murmur resulted in the suspicion of infective endocarditis. He is planned for blood culture and awaiting results. Directed empirical antibiotics are initiated.   An Echocardiogram is planned to confirm the diagnosis  assess valve function and look for any vegetations or abscesses. The dental health issues and history of IV drug use come into play as these could have served as local site for bacteremia.  If left untreated  infective endocarditis can result in serious complications  including heart failure  systemic emboli  and death. As such  the patient is counselled about the importance of continuous and effective treatment. Close Monitoring will be needed to evaluate infection response  cardiac function  and identify complication. +- The patient will also be referred to a dental hygienist to treat existing dental issues and promote future oral health  reducing the risk of future endocarditis episodes. Referral to a hepatologist would be considered for potential treatment of his Hepatitis C.  The patient's substance use disorder history is also noted. He will be referred to a clinical psychotherapist to manage his substance abuse history and social worker consultation would be beneficial for appropriate community resources.   This case is a classic presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis  which is most commonly caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal pathogens. Though African Americans exhibit lower rates of infective endocarditis compared to White Americans  in the case of our patient  his past history of IV drug use  poor dental hygiene and diabetes increases his risk  reinforcing that health disparities stem from a combination of genetic  environmental  and sociological factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,75,Patient Profile:   Mr. X is a 52-year-old male construction worker from suburban New England  USA. He is of Caucasian ethnicity  non-smoker  but has a history of excessive alcohol consumption. He is married with two adult children and lives with his wife and a pet dog.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. In his early thirties  he had a diagnosis of rheumatic fever but had no known issues with his heart valves. He received treatment and regular follow-ups during this phase. There has been no record of IV drug use. He does not have any allergies  and his immunizations are up-to-date.  Family History:  There is no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases  but both his parents had type 2 diabetes. His older sister was diagnosed with hypertension in her late forties.   Clinical Presentation:  Mr. X was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of high-grade fever  fatigue and new-onset shortness of breath for a week  neglecting it initially as work-related stress. He also stated he had experienced unintentional weight loss over the month.   Investigations:   On systemic examination  he had splenomegaly  a murmur heard on cardiac auscultation in mitral region  petechiae  and Osler's nodes on hands and feet. Blood cultures were taken  and echo-cardiography was ordered  which revealed vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis  possibly native-valve endocarditis considering his past history of rheumatic fever.  Further investigations confirmed the diagnosis of native valve  infective endocarditis.  Management Overview:  Mr. X was started on empiric antibiotic therapy  as the final culture results are awaited. Consultation with a cardiology team was done. His general condition improved after the initiation of antibiotics. The decision about the necessity of surgical intervention awaits the comments from the cardiovascular surgery team considering the size of his vegetations and his overall clinical condition.  Preventative Counseling:  Upon discharge  Mr. X will need regular follow-ups and extensive counseling on maintaining good oral hygiene  minimal alcohol consumption  and proper management of his chronic conditions to prevent recurrent infective endocarditis. He should also be educated about the signs and symptoms of infectious endocarditis so he can seek immediate medical attention if they recur.  This case discussion is to make informed decisions about the potential clinical outcomes  the necessity for further intervention  and ways of prevention of recurrent episodes.  (Actual patient care decisions should be made based on individual patient and clinical circumstances.)   Note: Although the case demographic and disease profile are based on scientific literature  they do not represent every patient's experiences and outcomes with native valve infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,76,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 68-year-old African American male who is currently admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of recurrent fever  malaise  and weakness of 1-month duration. He also notes recent weight loss and night sweats. There is no known drug or alcohol abuse. His vitals (BP: 140/90mmHg  Pulse: 110 bpm  Temp: 101°F) imply a state of continuous mild pyrexia. His ethnicity was included due to the incidence and prevalence rates of endocarditis noted to be significantly higher among African American males.  Medical History:  He has a past medical history suggestive of type 2 diabetes mellitus (managed with metformin and diet) and hypertension (managed with losartan). Recently  his glycemic control has been suboptimal with HbA1c level above 8%. He underwent a dental procedure two months ago without antimicrobial prophylaxis. He has no history of IV drug use or any recent surgeries which makes him a case of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Family History:   He denied having any familial history of autoimmune diseases  cardiovascular diseases  or malignancies.  Examination & Investigation:  On physical examination  non-tender petechial lesions were found on his palms and soles  and slight murmur was noticed on auscultation. An ophthalmologic exam revealed Roth spots. Echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve with mild regurgitation. Blood culture reports were positive for Streptococcus viridans.  Management:  He was started on intravenous administration of Penicillin G  and Gentamycin to cover for the most likely organism as revealed by the blood culture result. The patient is being closely monitored for signs of congestive heart failure  and the cardiology team will be consulted to assess the need for future surgical intervention.  Summary:  This is a classic case of native valve infective endocarditis in an elderly African American male with a history of teeth cleaning procedure without prophylaxis  diabetes  and hypertension. His symptoms  together with the physical findings (petechiae  Roth spots) and positive blood culture for Streptococcus viridans  constitute a diagnosis of definite infective endocarditis as per the Modified Duke's Criteria. His diabetes  though not directly related to endocarditis  might hamper his immunity and worsen his prognosis. The relevance of including ethnicity is due to the well-documented disparity in cardiovascular disease seen in African Americans. Boosting his clinical management  we assert that his long-term outcomes may be improved.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,77,Patient Information:   The patient  Mr. J.S.  is a 60-year-old African American male from an urban setting. He has a history of IV drug usage but has been clean for the past 5 years. There is no history of smoking  and he consumes moderate alcohol.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. J.S. presented with a two-week history of fever  fatigue  and intermittent confusion  which has worsened in the past few days. He also reported occurrence of night sweats and weight loss of approximately 5 kg in the past two weeks.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension  managed with medication (Lisinopril 20 mg)  and past intravenous drug usage which he stopped 5 years ago  after a rehabilitation program and ongoing therapy. He has had Hepatitis C in 2005  treated successfully.  Family History:  His family history reveals that his father had coronary artery disease and passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 58. His mother is alive  aged 85  and has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has one sister  healthy  aged 55years.  Examination:   On examination  Mr. J.S was febrile with a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new systolic murmur in the mitral valve area. A fundoscopic examination of his eyes revealed a few Roth Spots and his fingers showed clubbing.  Diagnosis:  Based on the presentation  clinical findings  and history of IV drug use  a diagnosis of possible Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis was considered. Further investigations  including Blood Cultures to identify the causative organism  Transesophageal echocardiogram to identify any vegetation  and a complete blood count to confirm any inflammation/infection  were ordered.  Results:  Blood cultures grew Streptococcus Viridans  and his Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the mitral valve. His white blood cell count was elevated  indicating a systemic inflammatory response.   Treatment:  Management began with intravenous Penicillin and Gentamicin as per Infective Endocarditis Therapy regimen  together with heart failure management.   Patient education and counseling sessions for ongoing care and the importance of medication adherence were conducted. The possibility of valve replacement surgery in the future was discussed with Mr. J.S.   Conclusion:  This case presents a 60-year-old African American male with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  likely due to his previous intravenous drug use. In addition  complications were minimized through early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management  indicating the necessity of prompt diagnosis and management in such cases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,78,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 66-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency room with a 1-week history of intermittent fever  loss of appetite  night sweats  and a feeling of general malaise. Mr. J’s temperatures have been averaging 101˚F. He has no relevant travel history  but mentioned a dental procedure about three weeks before the onset of symptoms.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes controlled with oral medications. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and consumes alcohol socially. In addition  he has had a joint replacement surgery in the past. There is no known drug allergy.  Family History:  His father died from complications of a stroke at an age of 72 and his mother died at 76 from congestive heart failure. Both of his siblings are living and healthy.  Social History:  Mr. J is a retired mechanical engineer. He lives with his wife and has 2 grown-up children. He is moderately active and enjoys working on DIY projects and gardening.  Physical Examination:  On examination  he appeared lethargic and had a heart rate of 98 bpm. Auscultation revealed a new cardiac murmur. There were no Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions. His overall oral hygiene appeared poor with several carious teeth.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Initial laboratory investigations showed a slightly elevated total leucocyte count  neutrophilia  and raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures isolates Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiography showed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Thought Process:  The patient's history of recent dental procedure was a crucial clue pointing towards a possibility of native valve endocarditis. The dental procedure  combined with poor oral hygiene  likely allowed mouth bacteria to infiltrate the bloodstream and adhere to the heart valves.  Plan:  After consulting with cardiology and infectious disease specialist  Mr. J was started on IV penicillin and gentamicin for six weeks. He was also referred to a dentist for the management of oral health. The importance of good oral hygiene was stressed and follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his progress.  Implication:  Mr.J presents a classic case of infective endocarditis originating from a dental procedure in the setting of poor oral hygiene. His case also highlights the significance of social history  as his heavy smoking habit may have contributed to the vascular changes that allowed bacteria to adhere and grow in his heart.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,79,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male with a diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). He is married and a retired schoolteacher living in rural Georgia. The patient's primary language is English and he has a Higher School Certificate. His past medical history includes a diagnosis of Type II diabetes for which he takes metformin twice daily  hypertension managed with lisinopril daily  and moderate hyperlipidemia managed with rosuvastatin.   Clinical Details:  He first presented with intermittent fevers  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss over the past month. Several days ago  he began experiencing chest discomfort and shortness of breath  leading his primary care physician to refer him for cardiac assessment. An echocardiogram revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the mitral valve and a positive blood culture identified Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore  the diagnosis of NVIE was confirmed.  Family History:  The patient's father died of heart disease in his early seventies  and his mother died at 85 with Alzheimer's disease. He has one brother who is in his sixties and is living with heart disease. The patient's two children are healthy.  Social History:  The patient is a long-time smoker with a 30 pack-year history and admits to occasional alcohol use but denies any illicit drug use. He is not very physically active and has a diet high in sodium and saturated fat  contributing to his more significant cardiac risk factors.  Current Treatment:  Inpatient treatment was initiated promptly  including intravenous antibiotics per Infective Endocarditis protocol. Surgical consultation is in process concerning the appropriateness of valve replacement given the patient's risk factors and disease severity.   Discussion:  Infective endocarditis is a significant public health issue  particularly among older individuals and those with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Demographics like the African-American race and men are disproportionately affected  indicative of our patient. Risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are present in the patient  contribute to the overall risk of developing NVIE. Additionally  lifestyle factors like smoking and diet further contribute significantly.   Preventative measures  as well as early diagnosis and aggressive treatment  are crucial as NVIE is associated with a high mortality rate. The coordination of care between doctors  nurses  dietitians  and other healthcare professionals will be crucial in managing the patient’s condition and improving his overall health.  Successful management of our patient's condition will need his active involvement in maintaining a healthier lifestyle post-discharge  including smoking cessation  healthier diet choices  and increased physical activity. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,80,Patient Name: John Doe Age: 53 Gender: Male Occupation: Plumber   Chief Complaint: Persistent fever and fatigue  Present Illness: Mr. Doe has been experiencing a persistent low-grade fever (approx 38.5-degree Celsius) and fatigue over the past two weeks. Additionally  he reported unintentional weight loss and occasional night sweats.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of IVDU (intravenous drug use) and was previously treated for Hepatitis C. He has been sober for nearly five years.   Family History: According to Mr. Doe  his mother died due to heart disease and his father had a stroke at the age of 65. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases or rheumatic fever.  Physical Examination: On general physical examination  Mr. Doe appeared pale and was in mild distress due to fatigue. His oral temperature was 38.3-degree Celsius. Heart auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur noted in the aortic valve area. An ocular examination revealed a few splinter hemorrhages in his nail beds.   Laboratory Findings: Blood tests showed mild anemia and increased level of ESR  CRP  and white blood cell count indicating an infection. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans  implicating a diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Echo-Cardiographic Findings: A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed a vegetation on one of the aortic valve leaflets. Left ventricular function was normal  with no sign of any cardiac dysfunction.   Diagnosis: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis possibly due to his past history of IVDU and recent streptococcal infection.   Management Plan: Given his diagnosis  Mr. Doe was started on IV antibiotic therapy with Penicillin and Gentamicin for a minimum of 4-6 weeks. His condition and response to treatment are to be continuously monitored. He has been strongly advised to maintain good dental hygiene and avoid any IV drug use. Surgical consultation will be considered if medical management fails or complications arise.  This case identifies the importance of a thorough clinical assessment in making a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis  particularly in an individual with a past history of risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,81,Patient Presentation:  Patient: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Complaint: He reported fatigue  intermittent fever  occasional shortness of breath  and weight loss over the past month. The patient also mentioned experiencing night sweats and a loss of appetite.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of rheumatic fever in his teenage years but was otherwise healthy until these recent symptoms appeared. Patient embarked on treatment for rheumatic fever and had no sequela of the disease since then.  Family History: Both of his parents passed away in their late 70s due to cardiovascular issues. His older sister (68 years old) has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus Type II. No cases of endocarditis in the immediate family  based on the patient’s knowledge.  Lifestyle: The patient lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver. He is a retired engineer and his alcohol use is occasional with rare usage of tobacco. He does not use illicit drugs and follows a moderate dietary plan.  Clinical Findings: Physical exam showed a mild fever  pale skin  and a new murmur was noted on the cardiac examination. Several Osler's nodes were detected on his fingers and toes  and Roth spots were visible in his eyes during fundoscopic examination.  Investigations: His complete blood count showed mild anemia with an elevated white blood cell count. Elevated ESR and CRP demonstrated an ongoing inflammation process. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  and the patient's EKG showed no signs of conduction abnormalities. An echocardiogram showed vegetations on the bicuspid aortic valve  confirming suspicions of endocarditis.  Diagnosis: Given his clinical picture  positive blood cultures  the presence of a new cardiac murmur  and echocardiographic findings  a diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE) was made.  Management and Prognosis: The patient was hospitalized and started on a regimen of IV antibiotics  initially on high-dose Penicillin G and Gentamicin  as per IDSA guidelines. He possibly would need surgery to repair or replace the valve if the infection progresses or if heart functions worsen. The prognosis for NVIE varies and depends on the patient’s clinical progression.  The clinical scenario is well within the average age of presentation for endocarditis  represented generally between the ages of 30-60 years with some studies showing a higher incidence rate in males. Possible risk factors in this case include age and a previous episode of rheumatic fever. Early detection and appropriate treatment might result in a good prognosis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,82,Patient Background: Gender: Male Age: 60 years Occupation: Farmer Race: Caucasian Residence: Rural area  Case Presentation: Mr. A  a 60-year-old Caucasian man  was admitted to the hospital following complaints of fever  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of about ten pounds over a two month period. The fevers were intermittent and associated with night sweats. Mr. A is a farmer and lives in a rural setting.   Medical History: His past medical history is relevant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. He takes oral hypoglycemic agents and Methotrexate to manage these conditions. The patient reported minimal alcohol consumption and denied tobacco use or illicit drug use. He had not been on any antibiotic therapy recently. He had no history of dental procedures or any episode suggestive of a continuous bacteremia.  Family History: Both parents were deceased. His father died of myocardial infarction and his mother died of colon cancer. His older brother  a 65-year-old  was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.   Clinical Examination: On physical examination  his temperature was 38.7 degrees Celsius  heart rate 110 bpm  blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. His cardiovascular exam revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Ophthalmologic examination showed Roth's spots  retinal hemorrhages with a clear center.  Investigations: Blood cultures revealed the growth of Streptococcus bovis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated vegetation on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further test like colonoscopy was performed due to the known association between S.bovis bacteremia and colonic pathology which revealed an adenomatous polyp.  Treatment: Treatment was oriented to the infective endocarditis with intravenous antibiotics based on culture sensitivity. An aortic valve replacement was done due to the severity of infection and regurgitation. The patient completed six weeks of antibiotics  and kept a regular follow up with Cardiology and Infectious Disease Departments.  Summary: This case highlights a presentation of infective endocarditis in a patient with risk factors including age and underlying rheumatoid arthritis. His occupation as a farmer may also have contributed to his increased susceptibility to infection. Prognosis is dependent on timely diagnosis and aggressive treatment. It also underscores the importance of a thorough evaluation for other potential primary sources of infection in the body as Mr. A had a colonic adenomatous polyp which may have been the primary source of the S.bovis bacteremia.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,83,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Presenting a case today of Mr. Ramirez  a 60-year-old Hispanic male resident of East Los Angeles. He is a retired school teacher  living with his wife and youngest son in a quiet suburb. Mr. Ramirez has no prior history of illicit drug use or any tattoos.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ramirez has a significant medical history  which includes being recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II  and hypertension for the past ten years. He has suffered from rheumatic fever in his childhood having lasting effects on his cardiovascular health. He does not have a history of any surgeries. There is no known history of any genetic diseases in the family.  Current Presentation: He was admitted to the hospital after presenting with a persistent high-grade fever  accompanied by night sweats  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss for the past four weeks. His wife also noted the presence of petechial skin lesions on his trunk. Four days before the emergency department visit  he started to have moderate chest discomfort on mild exertion. On physical examination  a soft mid-diastolic murmur was appreciated at the apex  followed with a later high-pitched click at the second intercostal space with inspiratory splitting of S2.  Investigations: On laboratory analysis  white blood cell count was elevated with a shift to the left. The blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans after serial plating  likely suggesting a bacterial endocardial involvement. The EKG showed no signs of acute ischemic changes. An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation. The evaluation of the source of infection revealed poor oral hygiene and progressive periodontal disease. A significant amount of dental caries was observed.  Diagnosis: Considering the presentation  clinical and laboratory findings  Mr. Ramirez was diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. The possible origin might be secondary to bacteremia from dental procedures  as studies reveal a higher rate of occurrence in patients with periodontal disease. Poor blood sugar control in Mr. Ramirez might have added to his susceptibility.  Treatment Plan: Antibiotic therapy was initiated  and blood sugar was controlled. Considering the consequences of possible embolization and the patient's progressively deteriorating mitral valve function  early surgical intervention was discussed with him. Mr. Ramirez provides informed consent and undergoes successful mitral valve replacement surgery. His postoperative course is uncomplicated. Dental treatment is arranged for Mr. Ramirez after recovery.  Reviewing literature  native-valve infective endocarditis is more prevalent among older men and individuals with pre-existing heart diseases. The presence of poor oral hygiene and diabetes only elevated the risk. Early diagnosis plays a significant role in reducing mortality and morbidity associated with infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,84,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male who has been previously healthy  presenting to the hospital with intermittent fevers  significant weight loss  and increasing fatigue over the past six weeks.  Medical History:  The past medical history reveals that the patient is hypertensive  controlled with Lisinopril for the past decade  and is a 20-pack-year smoker. He has no history of illicit drug use  dental abscess  or other infections. His family history is significant for congenital heart disease in both his brother and sister  but no family history of rheumatic fever.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient looked fatigued. Cardiac examination revealed a new murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. There were also several non-tender  erythematous lesions on the palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes. No other significant findings were found on a systemic examination.  Investigations:  His complete blood count showed a mild normocytic anemia and an elevated White blood cells count at 14 500. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also raised. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes.  Echocardiography revealed a mobile echo-density on the aortic valve suggestive of vegetation. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. Based on these findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Management and outcome:  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics based on sensitivity reports. After four weeks of treatment  repeat blood cultures were negative and inflammatory markers had responded. Repeat echo at six weeks showed resolution of the vegetation. Given the known family history of congenital heart disease and the complicated presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis  the patient is scheduled for genetic testing and regular cardiac follow-ups in the future.  This case illustrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in older individuals presenting with unexplained fevers  particularly those with predisposing cardiac conditions or relevant family history. It also highlights the importance of a thorough physical exam  which may reveal characteristic signs of endocarditis such as Janeway lesions or Osler nodes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,85,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  from a middle-class suburban community. He is a non-smoker and denies the use of any illicit drugs. He drinks in moderation. As to his occupational history  he is a long-term employee at a local factory.   Mr. Smith presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of intermittent fevers  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also noted a new heart murmur during a recent routine check-up with his primary care provider.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith’s past medical history reveals he had rheumatic fever as a child  which predisposes him to endocardic infection. Moreover  he was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse 5 years ago  which remains an ongoing issue. His most significant surgical history includes a total knee replacement two years ago. He has a mild allergy to penicillin  resulting in a rash.   Mr. Smith’s family history shows a high prevalence of cardiovascular disorders. His father and paternal grandfather both died from myocardial infarctions. His mother suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Findings:  In Emergency Department  Mr. Smith was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. His heart rate was mildly elevated (90 bpm)  his blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg  and his oxygen saturation was slightly reduced at 92% in ambient air.   Cardiovascular examination revealed a new systolic heart murmur  grades II/VI at the apex of the heart  which was not present in his previous medical records. No peripheral stigmata of endocarditis such as Osler's nodes  Janeway's lesions or splinter hemorrhages were noted.  Laboratory findings showed an increased WBC count and elevated inflammatory markers  including ESR and CRP. Blood cultures drawn in the ED  before the initiation of antibiotics  subsequently grew Streptococcus Viridans.   Imaging:  A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a mobile echodensity on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggestive of vegetations  confirming the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis.  Treatment:  Mr. Smith was admitted to the hospital and IV Ceftriaxone was initiated. He demonstrated improvement both clinically and in his inflammatory markers over the subsequent days. It was decided by the Infection Diseases  Cardiology  and Cardiothoracic teams to manage Mr. Smith conservatively with antibiotics rather than immediate surgery. Long term follow-up and management were planned.  Conclusion:  In Mr. Smith’s case  in light of his previous history of rheumatic fever and mitral valve prolapse  the development of infective endocarditis was a serious but not unforeseen complication. It demonstrates the importance of routine checks and vigilant observation for new signs and symptoms  especially in the light of a new heart murmur in a patient with a known history of valvular disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,86,Patient Information: A 62-year-old Hispanic female  Mrs. Maria Gomez  a resident of Texas  has been admitted to the healthcare facility with ongoing fever and generalized weakness for the past 3 weeks.  Past Medical History: Maria has a history of rheumatic fever during her adolescence with minimal long-term cardiac impact. Her other prevalent conditions include Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is being managed with Metformin  and Hypertension  under control with Lisinopril. She also had a cholecystectomy ten years ago. There is no known drug allergy. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially.  Family History: Her father had a history of cardiac issues  with a myocardial infarction at the age of 67  and her mother had Type 2 Diabetes. She has two siblings – a brother with obesity and a sister in good health.  Presenting Complaints: Maria has been experiencing a high-grade fever  weakness  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. On further inquiry  she reported experiencing night sweats and occasional chest discomfort over the past weeks.   Examination and Investigation: Her physical examination revealed a systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation and petechial rash on her upper extremities. Lab findings showed an elevated ESR  C-reactive protein  and leukocytosis suggestive of systemic inflammation. More specific investigations like blood culture assays returned positive  reaffirming the presence of infectious agents. The echocardiogram showed vegetations on her mitral valve indicating infective endocarditis.  Discussion: The findings correspond with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE). Maria's history of rheumatic fever is pertinent given its association with valvular damage  predisposing her to NVIE. Further  her demographic  age  and ethnicity align with literature suggesting that among Americans  older adults and Hispanics present higher rates of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. Risk factors like her underlying comorbid conditions (DM and HTN) contribute significantly to the disease process.  Treatment: Maria is currently being treated empirically with intravenous antibacterials while awaiting full blood culture results to guide more specific antibiotic intervention. Further plans include monitoring for signs of cardiac failure  embolic phenomena  and medication side effects.  Conclusion: It is essential to provide Maria with a multidisciplinary care approach tailored to manage her NVIE  coordinate her extant comorbidities  and ensure full recovery. Her situation underscores the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for NVIE in patients with a similar demographic and clinical profile.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,87,Patient Information: A 48-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  intravenous drug abuse  and ethanol abuse. He did not have a history of congenital heart defects or rheumatic heart disease. He was living with his wife  and they have two children all in good health. The family medical history included myocardial infarction and hypertension in the father’s line.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and weight loss. He also reported the recent onset of a new murmur.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was febrile (Temp. 101.4°F) and pale. His heart rate was increased (110 bpm)  and he had a new holosystolic murmur heard at the apex of the heart. He also had Janeway lesions in his palms and soles  and Osler nodes were present.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient's blood cultures tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. A chest X-ray was normal  and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. An echocardiogram displayed vegetation on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis. The patient was also found to have elevated ESR and CRP levels indicating ongoing inflammation.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on an empiric antibiotic regimen of intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. Insulin was administered to control blood glucose levels. Detoxification and recovery process from drug and alcohol abuse were initiated with the help of addiction specialists.   Outcome and Follow-up: Subsequent blood cultures cleared after two weeks of antibiotic therapy  showing an effective response to the treatment. Subsequent echocardiograms showed a reduction in the vegetations size. The patient was maintained on IV antibiotics for six weeks. The patient had several counselling sessions for drug and alcohol abuse and was enrolled in a rehabilitation program. His diabetes management continued with regular insulin administration and diet regulation.   In conclusion  this was a classic presentation of infective endocarditis in an individual with a complex social history that included intravenous drug use  coupled with comorbidities like diabetes and alcohol abuse.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,88,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Sex: Female Age: 60 years Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Condition:  Jane has been admitted complaining of a persistent fever  loss of appetite  and heart palpitations for the past couple of weeks. She has a history of intravenous drug use in her distant past but has been sober for over 30 years.  Past Medical History:  She has a history of several comorbidities. Jane has a 10-year history of Type II diabetes and hypertension. She has been managing both diseases effectively with medications and diet. Additionally  she had a congenital heart defect which was surgically corrected when she was an infant. No other surgeries in her medical history have been reported.  Family History:  Jane's father died of a myocardial infarction at 75 years of age; her mother died from complications related to Alzheimer's at 90. She has one older sister who is living with osteoporosis  and a younger brother who has a history of substance abuse and HIV.  Review of Systems:  On examination  Jane presented with a low-grade fever  fatigue  and shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed a murmur suggestive of possible valvular disease. Jane also reported a recent unintentional weight loss. No other abnormal findings were noted during the physical examination.  Investigations:  Concerning her murmurs  heart palpitations  and persistent fevers  further investigations were done. EKG displayed some arrhythmia. Two separate blood cultures drawn 12 hours apart came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus  confirming her infection. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) subsequently identified vegetation on her mitral valve  leading to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  Antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately using intravenous vancomycin. A team including cardiology  infectious diseases  and cardiac surgery specialists was assembled to manage the case. given the patient's medical history  and the size and stability of the vegetations  it has been agreed that the patient would undergo valve replacement surgery following a course of antibiotics to control the infection.  Discussion:  Native valve infective endocarditis is a crucial diagnosis due to its serious implications and need for early treatment. This case aligns with literature showing that the condition can be more common in those with heart defects corrected early in life  and those who have a history of intravenous drug use - even if distant. The choice of antibiotics was tailored to the identified organism  which is the recommended treatment approach in clinical guidelines.  Considering the patient's age and comorbidities  a multidimensional approach involving professionals from different medical specialties will be essential to provide the best therapeutic strategies. Although the risk associated with surgery poses a significant concern  it may be necessary to prevent further potential complications related to endocarditis such as heart failure and systemic infections.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,89,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 56-year-old African American male with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Research indicates that infective endocarditis tends to be more common among males and individuals above 50 years. Moreover  African Americans tend to be at a higher risk for bacterial heart infection compared to other racial or ethnic groups in the United States.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both conditions of which have been managed through medication and diet. He also has a long history of intravenous drug use which ceased ten years ago. This increases his likelihood of contracting endocarditis.  Presenting Complaint:  He presented to the hospital with a two-week history of persistent high-grade fever  general malaise  night sweats  and weight loss  all of which are common symptoms of endocarditis. A new murmur was noted during his physical examination.  Investigations:  Blood Cultures have been ordered  which confirmed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. An echocardiogram displayed vegetation on the tricuspid valve  which was indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Family History:  His mother had rheumatic heart disease and his father was hypertensive and diabetic. No known family history of endocarditis.  Social History:  The patient is a divorced single father of two children  works as a construction worker and resides in an urban environment. He has a history of heavy smoking and a past history of intravenous drug use.  Management Plan:  Given the results of the investigations  empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and gentamicin has been initiated. A consultation with a cardiothoracic team was also suggested to evaluate the need for surgical intervention  considering the severity of the valve damage detected in the echocardiogram.  This case highlights the importance of vigilance in quickly recognizing and treating native-valve endocarditis  particularly in patients with a history of intravenous drug use or in demographics more susceptible to the disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,90,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jose Rodriguez  aged 61  is a Hispanic American male who lives in Los Angeles  California. He presents to the Cardiology Clinic with complaints of fever  fatigue  and a recent inexplicable weight loss. He does not smoke or drink and leads a rather sedentary lifestyle with little to no physical activity due to his previous occupation as an office worker.  Past Medical History:   Jose has a chronic history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and had previously suffered a mild stroke at the age of 57 which left him with a slight right-sided weakness. He also has a history of mild hypertension  for which he was prescribed medication  although he admitted difficulty adhering to it due to his busy lifestyle. His most recent blood pressure was 140/90mmHg during his last clinic visit. He also has a history of gingivitis and had a tooth extraction performed about a month ago.   Family Health History:  Jose has a strong family history of heart diseases  with his father having suffered from multiple myocardial infarctions and his mother having died from complications arising from congestive heart failure. His elder brother  age 68  was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  Current Presentation:  Upon physical examination  the patient displayed signs of congestive heart failure with mild bilateral lower extremity edema. He was slightly short of breath  even at rest. Blood tests showed an increased ESR and C-reactive protein level  suggesting a possible systemic infection. A heart examination revealed a new cardiac murmur  leading the clinician to suspect infective endocarditis. The suspicion was later confirmed by a Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE)  which revealed vegetations on his mitral valve. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  a common causative organism for native valve endocarditis  often associated with dental procedures.  This presentation has elements that are common in cases of native valve endocarditis like the patient's previous dental intervention  the chronic disorders like diabetes and hypertension  and the family history of heart disease. The common symptoms of fatigue  weight loss  and fever  coupled with cardiac murmur and positive blood cultures  strongly point towards a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. It is important to note that native valve endocarditis is generally more common in male patients  similar to this case  as described in the literature.  Diagnosis:   Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans.   Follow up:  Jose's treatment plan involves long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy aimed at the identified organism  dietary advice to manage his diabetes better  and a strict follow-up schedule to monitor the progression of his condition. He was also advised to report immediately in case of any neurological symptoms due to the potential risk for embolic stroke associated with this condition. Additionally  a consult with the dental team was made to educate him about the importance of maintaining oral health in preventing recurrent endocarditis. The plan for surgical repair of the valve would be considered depending on his response to the medical treatment and ejection fraction status.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,91,Patient Presentation  The patient  a 55-year-old African American male  was presented to our care with severe fatigue  pallor  and unexpected weight loss. He complained of high-grade intermittent fever with chills dating back 3 weeks prior. An alarming symptom that proceeded was experiencing shortness of breath on exertion  profound enough to restrict his daily activities.  Past Medical History  The patient has a medical history significant for smoking  alcohol consumer  and illicit drug usage  specifically intravenous drug use  which he quit around 10 years back. He is hypertensive  controlled on medication  and was diagnosed with AIDS 5 years ago. Interestingly  he has no known cardiac history and his records consistent with regular medical visits and follow-ups.  Family History  The patient’s father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62  mother is a known diabetic and hypertensive. His only sibling  a brother  is in good health with no known chronic disease.  Examination and Result  Physical examination displayed substernal systolic murmur of grade IV/VI heard best at the left lower sternal border with no radiation. The patient appeared pale  tired and was diaphoretic. Examination of the primary hypertension showed systolic murmur with no accompanying signs of endocarditis - no Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  Roth spots  or splenomegaly were detected.  Blood cultures were ordered and were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. His cardiac biomarkers turned out to be normal  while EKG showed no significant abnormalities. Echocardiography revealed a vegetation of about 1 cm on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.  Diagnosis  Combining these observations  clinical findings  and laboratory data  we made a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's IV drug use history  though not recent  along with the lack of any prosthetic valve or rheumatic fever history likely pointed towards the native valve rather than a prosthetic valve being affected.  Treatment & Prognosis  The patient was administered a daily dose of intravenous antibiotic Ticarcillin-clavulanate  with his treatment course spanning over six weeks. His shortness of breath was managed with prescribed diuretics. HIV/AIDS management treatment was also optimized by a qualified infectious disease specialist. The patient showed a slow improvement in his vitals  symptoms  and overall health condition. He was advised regular follow-ups  strict compliance with medications  and a balanced diet accompanied by mild to moderate exercise.   The case was a succinct presentation of infective endocarditis in a patient with past medical history demonstrating high-risk behaviors  coupled with predisposing factors such as HIV/AIDS and substance misuse  showcasing the need to incorporate these prominent characteristics into one's diagnostic thinking when relevant symptoms are presented. It stands as a reminder of the potential severity of some fairly common symptoms when seen in a complex patient group.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,92,Case Presentation  Demographics: Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban area.  Presenting complaint: The patient came in with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  and loss of appetite.   Past medical history: The patient has a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and end-stage renal disease (ESRD)  which are common comorbidities associated with infective endocarditis (IE)  according to literature. He has been on hemodialysis for the last 2 years. Previously  he had a myocardial infarction five years ago  but he hasn't had any cardiac surgery.  Family history: There is no reported family history of heart disease or other relevant genetic predisposition.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed pallor and splinter hemorrhages in his fingernails suggesting subacute bacterial endocarditis. There was no evidence of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis such as Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.   Investigations: Lab results showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Two sets of blood cultures obtained from different sites returned positive for MRSA  a common pathogen in native-valve infective endocarditis. Further evidence of IE was provided by a Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE)  which showed a large mobile vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.   Treatment: The multidisciplinary IE team decided to initiate treatment with intravenous vancomycin and rifampicin following current guidelines. Control blood cultures were ordered after 48 hours of antimicrobial therapy to evaluate the response. The possibility of surgical intervention was also discussed  considering the size of vegetation and the risk of embolization and hemodynamic instability.  In our patient  the likely predisposing factor for native valve IE was his chronic kidney disease and consequent hemodialysis  a well-documented risk factor for bacteremia and infectious complications. This case underscores the importance of considering infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis for patients on hemodialysis presenting with prolonged fever  despite lack of cardinal clinical signs of IE.     Note: The specifics would have to be adjusted based on the region or population you're studying  as factors like common comorbidities  common bacterial strains  and treatment strategies can vary.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,93,Patient Presentation: Mr. Rodriguez  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  and fatigue for the past three weeks. Mr. Rodriguez is a resident of Texas  U.S.  where he operates a farm amidst a large Hispanic community. He has a history of tobacco smoking (20 pack years) and occasional alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type II five years ago and has been compliant with Metformin 500mg twice daily. He was also diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis two years ago  for which he has been receiving low dose Methotrexate therapy along with daily NSAIDs. He has no known drug allergies.  Complete Demographics: Born in McAllen  Texas  Rodriguez is a 5th generation Mexican American and communicates efficiently in both Spanish and English. He completed high school and pursued a brief certification course in agriculture  before joining the family business of farming. He lives with his wife and has two adult children. Mr. Rodriguez's annual income puts him in the lower-middle-class category. Due to his urban setting and income bracket  he has access to primary healthcare facilities.  Family History: There's a significant family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  with his mother also being a diabetic patient. His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Mr. Rodriguez has a younger brother diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis as well.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient started feeling unwell approximately three weeks ago. Initial symptoms included low-grade fever  malaise  which gradually worsened over a period of a week. He also experienced night sweats  fatigue  transient joint pain  and loss of appetite. In the past week  Mr. Rodriguez noticed increasing shortness of breath and unintentional weight loss.  Physical Examination: On general examination  Rodriguez was found to be febrile (100.6°F) with a slightly elevated blood pressure  (140/90 mmHg). A cardiac examination revealed mild tachycardia with a soft systolic murmur heard best at the apex. An inspection of fingers showed splinter hemorrhages under the nail beds.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Laboratory findings showed elevated leukocyte count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). A blood culture has been sent and we're awaiting results. An echocardiogram showed significant vegetations on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  supporting our diagnosis of a native valve endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward and started on empirical antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Gentamicin. Further therapy will be decided based on the outcome of his blood culture and antibiogram results. His diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis medication routines have been continued with adjustment for his current disease status.  Further Plan: As well as monitoring response to antibiotics  surgery is being considered in case of therapy failure  signs of heart failure  or recurrence of emboli. Additionally  smoking cessation advice  diet adjustment  and exercise routine have been implemented as part of his comprehensive care plan. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,94,Patient Presentation  Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a 64-year-old Caucasian male engineer  non-smoker  with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.  Past Medical History: His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension  for which he has been taking Lisinopril 10 mg once daily. He underwent a mitral valve repair surgery due to mitral regurgitation 25 years ago and has been in normal sinus rhythm since then. His last dental procedure was a root canal treatment about six months ago.  Family History: His mother had rheumatic heart disease  necessitating mitral valve surgery in her later years. His father was hypertensive and died of a myocardial infarction at age 75. He has three siblings  all living  with no history of cardiac diseases.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presented with complaints of intermittent fever  night sweats  malaise and weakness for the past 3 weeks. He also reported an unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg over the last month.  Examination and Diagnosis: On examination  his temperature was found to be 101.5 F  BP was 140/85 mmHg  and Heart Rate was 95 bpm. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new systolic murmur at the apex. Blood investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers - ESR and CRP. There was moderate leucocytosis (WBC- 12 000 cells/cu mm) with increased neutrophils. His ECG showed no significant abnormalities.  Two sets of blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) confirmed ‘vegetations’ on the native mitral valve compatible with infective endocarditis.  Treatment: He was started on intravenous antibiotics: Penicillin G and Gentamicin as per local sensitivity profiles. Supportive measures were also started for his symptoms.  Summary: Mr. Johnson's prior mitral valve surgery  recent dental procedure  and the presence of Streptococcus viridans in the blood cultures all contribute to his diagnosis of native valve endocarditis. His treatment has been initiated accordingly. Regular monitoring and adjustments of antibiotic therapy will be needed based on his clinical response and any adverse effects experienced.  This case illustrates the need for prophylactic measures to prevent infective endocarditis  especially in patients with prior history of valvular heart disease undergoing dental and other procedures introducing bacteria into the bloodstream.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,95,Patient Presentation The patient is a 45-year-old African American male diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis (I.E.). He works as a handyman and has been living in the rural south for his whole life. The patient presents with signs of moderate to severe malaise  intermittent fever alongside chills  and gradual weight loss for the past three weeks.  Past Medical History Mr. S reports a past history of intravenous drug use  primarily cocaine  from his 20s to mid-30s. His addiction was treated about ten years ago  and he has remained clean. However  the patient has previously been diagnosed with Hepatitis C presumably contracted during his period of substance misuse. After consultation  the patient also revealed a history of Rheumatic fever from his childhood.  Demographics The patient belongs to a low-income group and has limited access to healthcare services because of remote residence and inconsistent employment. The patient is unmarried  does not smoke or consume alcohol  and does not have children. Unfortunately  he is also homeless and resides in shelters or stays with friends occasionally. Despite struggling with his socio-economic status  he has managed to remain sober for a significant period  fighting substance misuse.  Family History Mr. S's mother passed away from heart disease complications in her 60s  and his father from a stroke in his early 70s. His older brother has a history of cardiovascular disease  and his sister has been diagnosed with diabetes type 2. No family history of rheumatic heart disease or autoimmune disorders is reported.  Present Condition Upon examination  the patient exhibited an irregular heartbeat  lower extremity edema  and petechiae in the conjunctiva. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetation on the patient's mitral valve indicative of infective endocarditis. Significant mitral regurgitation and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy were also observed.   In terms of mental health  the patient has mild depressive symptoms  likely associated with his living condition and a stressed lifestyle. He expressed feelings of sadness  low energy levels  trouble concentrating  and occasional suicidal ideation with no plans or intent.  Conclusion Given the history of intravenous drug use  existing Hepatitis C infection  and evidence of Staphylococcus aureus infection  the patient is diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis. He is currently admitted to the hospital and started on treatment.  Note  Literature states racial/ethnic disparities in relation to Infective Endocarditis. African American males  such as the patient in this case  are disproportionally affected by this condition  often as a result of socioeconomic factors  including low income  access to healthcare services  history of drug use  and homelessness.  Please note that this case presentation includes assumptions based on norms from existing literature and data and may not reflect every individual's experiences.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,96,Patient Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Presentation  A 65-year-old African-American male patient  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  Type 2 diabetes mellitus and gout  presented with a 10-day history of persistent  low-grade fever and progressive fatigue. He also reported experiencing intermittent chest discomfort and easy shortness of breath over the past week. He has no known drug allergies  smokes one pack of cigarettes daily  and does not drink alcohol. There is no history of intravenous drug abuse. Family history is notable for coronary artery disease with a father who died from a heart attack at the age of 70 and a mother who had a stroke at 75.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2 °C  had a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats/min  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Heart sounds were irregular and there was a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.   Diagnostic Assessment  Blood tests showed a raised total white count of 12 000 per cubic millimeter (normal 4 000–11 000)  a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the presence of a 1.5 cm x 1 cm irregular  mobile mass attached to the ventricular side of the second anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggestive of a vegetation. Three sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans highly suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Treatment  The patient underwent definitive therapy with intravenous antibiotics for six weeks guided by an Infectious Disease specialist. He also received anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation  and was referred to Cardiology for consideration of mitral valve surgery.  Discussion  This patient's presentation is consistent with native valve infective endocarditis  a serious condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk factors included age  male gender  and presence of chronic conditions (hypertension  diabetes). The diagnosis was based on positive blood cultures and the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve leaflet identified in the echocardiogram. Early recognition  appropriate antimicrobial therapy  and possible surgical intervention are vital for better prognosis.  This case report underscores the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients with suspected cardiac abnormalities such as valve diseases presenting with persistent fever and other systemic symptoms. This is particularly true in populations more likely to be affected such as the older adults and African Americans  who according to the available literature tend to have higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with other demographic groups. Importance is also stressed on the need for optimized control of chronic conditions that may exacerbate infective endocarditis  such as diabetes and hypertension. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,97,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 64-year-old African American male  presenting complaints of intermittent fever and chills that has been ongoing over the past 3 weeks. The patient also cited fatigue  shortness of breath  and night sweats disturbing his sleep routine. On admission  he had a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  pulse rate of 100 bpm  and fever at 100.8°F. No significant weight loss was reported.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed with oral hypoglycemics  diagnosed approximately 10 years ago  and well-controlled hypertension observed since his late 40s. In his medical record it is also noted that he has recurrent profile of Staphylococcus aureus infections known for last 4 years. He underwent tooth extraction and minor sinus surgery a year ago. There is no record of illicit drug use or past surgeries other than the recent periodontal and sinus surgery.  Family History:  His mother died of stroke at the age of 79 and his father died of prostate cancer at the age of 70. His older brother  aged 70  is a known patient of coronary artery disease and his sister  aged 65  is a Type 2 Diabetic.  Social History:  He is a retired engineer  married with 3 children  residing in an urban community. He quit smoking 15 years ago but admits to drinking alcohol moderately and does not exercise regularly.  Findings and Diagnostic Assessment:  Clinical examination revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. No peripheral stigmata of endocarditis were found. Lab investigations indicated a higher than normal white blood cell count  ESR  and CRP  suggestive of a systemic infective process. A couple of sets of blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the native aortic valve consistent with infective endocarditis and moderate regurgitation.   Diagnosis:  Given the history  clinical presentation and diagnostic test results  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Plan:  The patient is planned to receive appropriate IV antibiotic therapy as per infectious disease consultation. He will be monitored closely for treatment response and further surgical intervention has not been ruled out. Regular follow-ups post his hospital stay will be scheduled to monitor progression. Patient’s diabetic status along with lifestyle changes particularly regular exercises  moderate alcohol use and oral hygiene need to be emphasized during his stay and discharge planning.   Comments:  Native-valve infective endocarditis often occurs in patients having a history of heart valve disease or previous endocarditis  but can also be associated with poor oral hygiene  immunosuppression  history of Intravenous drug use or  invasive procedures (like dental procedure). Our patient has some of these risk factors which might have led to endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,98,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our facility  showing signs of fever  chills  rigors  and fatigue. He reported experiencing a low-grade fever three weeks prior  which had been escalating over time. Alongside this  the patient also complained of unexplained weight loss of approximately 5 kg over the last month and generalized body aches.  Past Medical History: The patient had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago that was in good control with metformin. He also has a history of hypertension. There were no previous issues with regard to cardiovascular or renal diseases. No prior surgeries or transplants were reported. He reported regular check-ups at a local clinic  with the last being two months prior when his HbA1c and routine cardiovascular biomarkers were at normal levels.  Current Medications: He was on Metformin 500mg twice daily for his diabetes and took Captopril 50mg daily for his hypertension.  Family History: There was a reported family history of cardiac disease  with the patient's father succumbing to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 years. His 67-year-old sister has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. No family history of infective endocarditis was reported.  Habitual History: The patient is a retired high school teacher  a non-smoker  and social drinker. He has no known drug allergies. He reported poor dental hygiene practices and had not seen a dentist for over a year.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient appeared to be in distress. His body temperature was 38.5°C  blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  and heart rate was 100 bpm. His oxygen saturation was 95%  while breathing ambient air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new heart murmur.  Investigations: A range of investigations was undertaken  including a complete blood analysis  urine test  and cardiac imaging.  Patient’s blood cultures revealed a growth of Streptococcus viridans  sensitive to Penicillin G. Echocardiography was suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis with vegetations seen on the mitral valve.  Conclusion: The patient's clinical presentation  blood cultures and echocardiographic findings led to a diagnosis of definite native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management: The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward  given his diagnosis and the general medical condition in the event of possible complications. An infectious disease consultant was involved  Penicillin G was started as per sensitivity testing  and the patient’s clinical conditions were monitored closely. The patient’s poor dental hygiene was acknowledged as a potential non-cardiac source of the infection.  This case illustrates the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients with a new heart murmur  fever  and unspecific signs of infection  particularly in those with poor dental hygiene practices as the oral cavity can often be a reservoir of pathogens responsible for native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,99,Patient Profile:  Mr. J is a 56-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  with a history of intravenous drug use. He is divorced with no kids. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 32. According to CDC data  this demographics is at heightened risk for diseases like infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and smoking. He has been inconsistently compliant with his antihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications and his last known Hba1c level was 8.7%.  Current Presentation:  Over the past 3 weeks  Mr. J reports experiencing recurrent fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss. He also reports a new onset of shortness of breath  occasional cough with a small amount of blood  and night sweats. He has no complaints of chest pain  palpitations  or syncope.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination reveals a temperature of 38.5°C  heart rate of 95 bpm  and blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg. Chest examination showed dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at the left base  suggestive of a pleural effusion. Cardiac examination revealed a new holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex.   Pertinent Lab Data:  Complete blood count showed leukocytosis and anemia. His blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  Imaging:  Chest radiography revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate and small pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large  mobile vegetation on a normal-appearing mitral valve consistent with severe mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings  positive blood cultures  and imaging studies  Mr. J was diagnosed with left-sided native-valve infective endocarditis secondary to MSSA. The patient's condition suggests possible pulmonary septic emboli given the imaging findings and the occurrence of hemoptysis.  Treatment & Follow Up:  Appropriate IV antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately for MSSA. Considering the size of vegetation and the patient's clinical stability  he was offered surgical evaluation for possible early intervention. Patient education was carried out about the need for medication adherence to manage his diabetes and hypertension  cessation of tobacco use  and the risk linked with intravenous drug use.  This case emphasizes that infective endocarditis should be considered in patients with a history of intravenous drug use who present with fever and new murmur.  (Note: Please customize this data accordingly as this is just a demonstration of how a case of infective endocarditis can be presented. The data may not accurately represent risks or illness severity of infective endocarditis for all populations.)
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,9,100,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: A 54-year-old male African-American named Mr. Johnson presented at the emergency department of a local hospital in southern Louisiana.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson’s past medical history includes hypertension  managed by Lisinopril for the last 10 years  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with metformin for 5 years. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily  moderately consumes alcohol  and has a diet high in carbs and fats. There is no history of intravenous drug use.   Family History: Unfortunately  Mr. Johnson’s family history is significant. His father died at the age of 60 from a stroke and his mother was diagnosed with heart disease but lived until 78. He has one brother with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.  Current Complaint: Mr. Johnson was brought to the hospital with complaints of high-grade fever  chills  malaise  and a new-onset systolic murmur that he has been experiencing for a couple of weeks. Additionally  he reported an unintentional loss of about 10 pounds over the past month.  Examination and Result: Upon physical examination  he has a fever of 38.5°C  a heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. A first-degree AV block was found on his electrocardiogram (ECG). There were audible rales in the lower segments of both lungs. Auscultation of the heart revealed a new-onset grade 3 diastolic murmur heard best at the heart base.  Investigations: The laboratory studies were significant for leukocytosis (WBC count 13 000/uL) and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures were drawn  which suggested the presence of Gram-positive cocci. Upon performing a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)  a 2x1.5cm vegetation was visualized on the aortic valve.  Diagnosis and Treatment: Based on clinical findings  blood culture results  and echo findings  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He was hospitalized and empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin was started promptly  pending further susceptibility results. Cardiothoracic surgery was also consulted concerning the large vegetation and new-onset heart block  which could potentially indicate a need for surgery.  Follow-Up and Evaluation: The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotic therapy. Serial blood cultures turned negative and he reported a significant improvement in symptoms. Upon re-evaluating his case with Cardiothoracic Surgeons  a decision was made against immediate surgical intervention considering his positive response to medical management. The patient was thus continued on an antimicrobial regimen. Further management involves educating Mr Johnson on the importance of preventing IE by maintaining good oral hygiene and getting regular dental checkups.  This case ultimately underscores the importance of early recognition of the signs and symptoms of IE as delay in diagnosis and treatment can cause severe complications and mortality.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,1,"Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. A  Gender: Male  Age: 58  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Physical laborer  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a known history of intravenous drug use and was clean for about ten years. He had thankfully never contracted HIV or Hepatitis C. He also managed to overcome a year-long dependent on alcohol. He had previous episodes of non-specific skin infections. The patient reported to be a regular smoker for the past 40 years with a history of heart disease in his family.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. A presents to the emergency department  complaining of fever with chills  persistent fatigue  loss of appetite and steady weight loss over the past 2 months. Further probing revealed intermittent night sweats and unlocalized joint pain. On detailed inquiry  Mr. A reports that his """"heart feels like it's pounding out of his chest"""" sometimes.   As per the literature  these symptoms are consistent with that of native valve infective endocarditis (IE). Intravenous drug use is a key risk factor. IE is found to be more common in Caucasian males than any other demographic  with middle-aged individuals (30-60 years old) most affected. Also  people with pre-existing heart disease or artificial heart valves are more susceptible to IE. These characteristics were taken into consideration while designing this case.   [The clinical condition will further be detailed with appropriate clinical investigations and findings necessary for a complete medical workup  but as it deviates from the current request  it was not documented.]"
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,2,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male farmer  residing in the rural Midwestern United States with history of intravenous (IV) drug use.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a medical history of drug abuse  especially IV drug use from his forties leading to chronic Hepatitis C. He was treated for it during the previous year. He also reported prior episodes of binge drinking  though quit alcohol consumption five years back. He also has a history of untreated dental caries and periodontal disease.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented to the outpatient clinic with a four-week history of fever  fatigue  unintended weight loss  and an ebbing generalized body pain. He also reported a change in the colour of his urine to a dark yellow  and occasional night sweats. He mentioned experiencing a decreasing appetite over the previous month. He also reported an episode of transient visual loss in the right eye a week back  which resolved spontaneously.  This case design was created considering the demographic representation in literature. Infective endocarditis often occurs in individuals between 30 to 60 years  with a predominance in males. IV drug use is a major risk factor that predisposes individuals to this condition  which is corroborated by the patient's medical history. Other notable factors contributing to the risk include poor oral hygiene and chronic diseases such as Hepatitis C. The patient's rural residency correlates with the geographical epidemiology of endocarditis.  Notes for Educators: The case allows trainees to integrate knowledge across various medical areas  including infectious disease  cardiology  neurology  and immunology. The differential diagnosis should initially be broad  but through relevant history taking  physical examination and subsequent investigations  trainees should hone in on a diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis. Excellent talking points would include the importance of recognizing the presence of non-specific symptoms such as fever and fatigue  the role of dental hygiene in preventing systemic diseases  and the impact of social determinants on health.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,3,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  The patient is an African American male  aged 60 years old  hailing from an urban low-income setting. He is retired  has a high school-level education  and is a former tobacco user. No known drug or alcohol abuse.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II for the past 10 years  which has been fairly controlled. He also suffers from moderate hypertension. The patient underwent dental procedures twice over the past year. No known allergies were documented.  Presenting Complaints: Patient has been experiencing severe fevers  ongoing for the past 10-15 days. He presents with persistent fatigue  poor appetite  weight loss  and night sweats. Recently  he has been reporting muscular pains as well. He also complains of experiencing heart palpitations over the last week.   Rationale:  Various epidemiological studies indicate that infective endocarditis (IE) shows a greater disposition towards males  particularly those aged 60+ years. Studies also show that IE is common among African American populations and people from low socioeconomic classes. Risk factors considered include dental procedures and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension  which align with the patient's medical history. The common symptoms of IE include persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats  poor appetite  weight loss  and occasionally heart palpitations - all of these have been reported by the patient in this case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,4,Patient Information: Mr. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  working as a farmer in rural Pennsylvania.  Chief Complaint: High fever  malaise  night sweats  fatigue  shortness of breath on exertion and a new onset of a heart murmur.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of:  1. Mild aortic regurgitation (native-valve) diagnosed 3 years ago via an echocardiogram. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus  well-controlled with metformin. 3. Combined Hyperlipidemia  controlled with statin therapy. 4. Prior tobacco use  having quit approximately 10 years ago. 5. No known drug allergies.  Family History: His father suffered from coronary artery disease and mother had a history of hypertension and osteoporosis. He has one older brother with type 2 diabetes and an older sister with no serious health conditions.  Review of Systems: Patient admits to experiencing unexplained weight loss and weakness for the past couple of weeks. Denies chest pain  palpitations  syncope  cough  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  edema  gastrointestinal symptoms.   Clinical presentation: On physical examination  the patient is febrile with a temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F). His heart rate is 105 beats/min and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regurgitant murmur at the right upper sternal border that changed in character since his last medical checkup.   The case of Mr.J is designed to provide a clinically appropriate scenario for a patient with infective endocarditis to help medical students understand the disease's progression  clinical presentation  management  and complications. It takes into account most common risk factors of infective endocarditis: an existing heart valve disease and diabetes. In the U.S.  it's most frequently diagnosed in males  especially within the age group of our patient. Moreover  this case presents the commonly manifested systemic symptoms of the disease such as fever  malaise  night sweats  and weight loss without any apparent cause.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,5,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 60-year-old African American woman presents to the emergency department (ED).  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use (IVDU). She has been clean for approximately ten years. The patient also has a history of hypertension and occasional migraines.  Current Complaints: The patient complains of a high-grade fever that has persisted for over a week  malaise  and significant weight loss over the past two months. She also reports a recent episode of night sweats.  Case Scenario: The woman resides in a low-income urban area and works as a store clerk. She initially noticed a low-grade fever which progressed to a high-grade fever over the course of a week. She tried treating it with generic over-the-counter flu medicines without success  which prompted her eventual visit to the ED.  Over the course of the last month  she also started feeling constantly fatigued and lost nearly 10 pounds unintentionally. Furthermore  she reports difficulty in breathing during moderate physical activities such as climbing stairs or walking a short distance  which were formerly routine for her. She denies any chest pain or palpitations.   In triage  she is noted to be febrile with temperature of 101.8°F  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 21/min  and blood pressure of 132/85 mmHg. Upon physical examination  there is notable pallor  splinter hemorrhages under the nail beds  and osler nodes on her fingers and toes. A heart murmur is observable during the cardiac examination. She also has splenomegaly on abdominal examination.  Work up including blood tests  cultures  and an echocardiogram suspecting native-valve infective endocarditis is ordered due to her history  presentation symptoms  and physical examination. Initial blood tests show mild anemia  leukocytosis  and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein indicating a severe systemic infection. Meanwhile  blood culture results are being anticipated.  Take Away: The patient is representative of typical native-valve endocarditis patients who are often older persons and might have a past of significant IVDU. Furthermore  she represents the population that might have limited access to healthcare due to their socioeconomic status. Despite well-documented physical findings suggestive of endocarditis  it stays a diagnosis that is often missed due to vague symptoms overlapping with many other illnesses. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough history taking and physical examination in such individuals.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,6,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male. He works in construction and lives in a suburban neighborhood in Denver  Colorado. He is married and has two grown children. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol and has no history of illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a documented history of surgically repaired bicuspid aortic valve in his early 30s. He has a controlled hypertensive regimen for the past ten years and has a congenital heart murmur. His father passed away from cardiovascular disease at age 64  and his mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes.  Key Complaints:   The patient presented himself to the ER with a chief complaint of a high-grade fever for the past 4 days  associated with chills  severe fatigue  and rapid unexplained weight loss over the last two weeks. He also reported an increasing difficulty in breathing and intermittent chest pain during the same duration.   Analysis:  The collected information depicts a high-risk scenario for native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE)  particularly due to his history of heart valve repair  an inherent heart murmur. The manifestation of symptoms such as persisting fever  fatigue  weight loss  and signs of heart problems like breathlessness and chest pain further heightens clinical suspicion. The case  therefore  is of significant educational value for medical students  primarily to enhance their clinical suspicions and decision-making skills.   It correlates to major epidemiological demographics; according to the literature  NVE is more prevalent among males and the middle-aged population. Prior cardiac history such as valve diseases/repairs significantly increases the risk. The case does not involve either substance abuse or healthcare-associated factors  indicating the necessity for students to understand that NVE can occur in the absence of these factors  especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,7,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Aguilar is a 52-year-old Hispanic male laborer from a rural setting  who presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of persistent and progressive malaise  fever  and unexplained weight loss. He is married with three children and his family history does not suggest any congenital heart diseases.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Aguilar was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago  and occasionally experiences poor glucometer control. Furthermore  he has a history of periodontal disease that was previously treated but has worsened within the past few years due to inconsistent dental care. He is a former alcoholic  quit drinking 8 years back  and has been a tobacco user for the past 30 years. There is no history of IV drug use  recent dental procedures  or noteworthy travel. He has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient complained of a high-grade fever that was not alleviated by over-the-counter antipyretics. Additionally  he was feeling increasingly fatigued  weak  and had unintentionally lost about 5kg over the last month. He was also experiencing night sweats and joint pain.  These demographics are representative of many patients diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis - male  with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and poor dental healthcare  indicating a potential source of infection. Contrary to popular belief  injectable drug users make up only a small subset of those diagnosed  providing a good teaching point about stereotype bias in the clinical setting. Hispanic and aged populations  as well as individuals exposed to occupational risk factors and lifestyle choices such as smoking  also have increased prevalence. This case  thus  accurately encompasses these demographic findings.  The case will be continued with investigations  subsequent diagnosis confirming native-valve infective endocarditis  followed by an explanation of the decision-making regarding treatment options  encouraging students to fully comprehend the relevance of the patient's clinical history  symptoms  and socio-demographic factors in managing this life-threatening condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,8,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  Ms. Jackson is a 65-year-old African American female  retired school teacher  and lifelong resident of an urban area in the Midwest. She is status post hysterectomy 20 years ago for benign reasons and has a 10-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is also a diagnosed hypertensive since age 60  and was under oral medication. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.   Recent Health Concerns:  Ms. Jackson was brought to the emergency department (ED) by her daughter due to progressive weakness and extreme fatigue over the past 2 weeks  accompanied by an intermittent fever spiking to a maximum of 102°F at home. She reports lack of appetite and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the last month. She stated that she feels short of breath and have developing painful red sores on her fingertips and toes that are tender and interferes with her ability to walk and perform her daily activities without pain.   Background:  Navajo American Indians and Alaskan Native populations have a higher incidence of infective endocarditis  but this pattern isn’t reflected in African Americans. African American female of middle-age have relatively lower incidence of native valve infective endocarditis  but risks can be elevated due to certain conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension which are quite prevalent in this population. This case is representative of an ethnic group that is often underrepresented in medical curricula.   Literature Reference:   Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019).

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,9,Patient Profile: Patient Name: Mr. B Age: 55 years Ethnicity: African American Gender: Male Occupation: Office Clerk  Residence: Urban dwelling  middle-income neighborhood  Past Medical History: - Type II diabetes mellitus – 15 years - Past IV drug abuse - clean for 10 years  Chief Complaint:  - History of fever and chills for the past 3 weeks. - Recently developed shortness of breath and generalized fatigue.  Additional information: Mr. B reported no recent dental procedures or indwelling devices. He has been non-compliant with his diabetic medications  with an inconsistent diet and lack of regular exercise being contributing factors. Social history reveals two packs per day smoking for 30 years and past intravenous drug use  now clean for 10 years.  Medical literature suggests the median age group for native valve infective endocarditis is typically between 50-70 years old. Males are more frequently affected than females  and there is a high prevalence in persons with a history of drug use. African Americans  particularly those within urban areas  are disproportionately affected  likely due to a combination of epidemiologic and socioeconomic factors. Concurrent conditions like diabetes enhance susceptibility  providing a set-up for healthcare-related procedures and likewise infective endocarditis. Compliance with medications and follow-up appointments is a common issue in such patients  linked to lack of education  socioeconomic stressors  or inherent factors associated with chronic diseases.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,10,Case Report   Patient Profile:  - Name: Mr. David Moreno - Age: 56 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic Caucasian  - Occupation: Carpenter  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Moreno presents with a 2-week history of fever and fatigue. He also reports feeling more fatigued after physical activity and notes experiencing a decrease in appetite with an unintended loss of 5 pounds in the last 3 weeks. He further describes nights sweats  shortness of breath on exertion  and minimal discomfort around his chest.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Moreno was diagnosed with moderate aortic stenosis 4 years ago  but he has not been following up for his condition. He had a dental procedure carried out one month ago. Due to his occupation  he has a history of occasional minor injuries  for which he self-treated. His other past medical history includes Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are well-controlled with medications. He does not smoke or consume alcohol excessively.   Epidemiology:  The choice of this case was influenced by the epidemiology of infective endocarditis. The condition has a high occurrence rate in males  especially those between the ages of 30 to 60 years. Non-Hispanic whites have been shown to have the highest incidence of endocarditis. Conditions such as aortic stenosis  history of invasive procedures (like dental procedures)  diabetes  and hypertension are known risk factors for developing infective endocarditis.  The symptoms presented  such as fever  fatigue  appetite and weight loss  night sweats  shortness of breath  and chest discomfort  are common symptoms of infective endocarditis. This case  therefore  is a good representation of how native-valve infective endocarditis can present in a fairly typical patient with several risk factors for the disease.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,11,Case Vignette:  Patient Information:   This case features a 53-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity. He is a full-time construction worker  married  living with his wife and two sons in urban North Carolina. No reported international travels. He is a smoker (smoking one pack daily for 20 years) and admits to moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 beers daily). No drug use.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus type II (NIDDM)  diagnosed seven years ago. He also has a history of Rheumatic Heart disease diagnosed during childhood. He adheres to a strict medication regimen of Metformin 500mg BID and Lisinopril 10mg daily  yet his blood pressure and glucose levels are moderately controlled. The patient denies any known drug allergies. There is no history of relevant surgeries. His family history is significant for Hypertension (father)  Myocardial Infarction (elder brother)  and NIDDM (mother).  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents to the Emergency Department complaining of progressive fatigue and weakness over the last three weeks  accompanied by intermittent fever and night sweats. He also reports a significant unintentional weight loss over the past month. He states he's been having new onset mild  dull  and constant retrosternal chest discomfort over the past week  which gets slightly better with rest. After a week  he noted increasing shortness of breath on mild exertion  which was not present before. There is no history of palpitations  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or orthopnea. He also notes a rash that started on his legs and has been spreading upwards over the past week. He denies cough  hemoptysis  abdominal pain  hematuria  or recent sexual exposure.  The representation of a patient with a high-risk background (construction worker)  pre-existing underlying chronic medical conditions like poorly controlled diabetes mellitus  and Rheumatic Heart disease comprises a complex condition  commonly associated with the native-valve infective endocarditis  reflecting a clinically relevant scenario for medical students' teaching and training. Also  the demographic representation of Hispanic ethnicity conveys the need to address cardiovascular diseases and related risks in minority ethnicities.   The case presentation encapsulates both constitutional and systemic symptoms and caters to the medical literature's typical presentation of native valve infective endocarditis. This case will facilitate teaching students to consider endocarditis as a differential diagnosis for sepsis or undifferentiated symptoms in patients with cardiovascular risk or disease. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,12,Patient Information:  A 65-year-old Hispanic male.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and a 30-year history of illicit intravenous drug use for which he attended rehab and has been clean for the last two years. There's no prior history of heart diseases.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of fatigue  low-grade fever  and unusual sweating  especially at night. He has also been experiencing unexplained weight loss and mild joint pain over the same period. The patient indicated that he had a dental procedure about a month ago.   This case aligns with literature indicating that native-valve infective endocarditis is often seen in older adults  and has been associated with Hispanic ethnicity. Other risk factors include poor dental hygiene leading to dental procedures  and history of intravenous drug use  although this typically affects the right side of the heart  particularly the tricuspid valve.    Encourage students to think critically and consider other differential diagnoses as well  such as malignancy and autoimmune diseases  which can present with similar constitutional symptoms. However  the recent dental work provides a clue  as minor dental or surgical procedures can serve as gateways for bacterial invasion of the bloodstream  potentially causing endocarditis in vulnerable patients. Furthermore  the patient's ethnic background should guide students to consider certain cultural and socioeconomic factors that can contribute to disease risk and health-care access.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,13,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  - Name: Mr. Johnson - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired repairman - Social history: Ex-smoker  moderate alcohol use  Past Medical History: -Mitral valve prolapse -Heart murmur -Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  Presenting Complaints:  - Persistent fever lasting for the past two weeks - Shortness of breath  notably worsening on exertion - Swelling in the legs - Transient  stabbing chest pain  - Unexplained weight loss  - Night sweats - Two episodes of syncope in the past week  While infective endocarditis can affect anyone  it is more prevalent in men aged 50 and above. Conditions that increase the prevalence include past history of valve disease  structural cardiac defects  and intravenous drug use. Other risk factors include diabetes mellitus  rheumatic heart disease  and a history of invasive procedures. The above case represents these demographics and risk factors.  Key points of focus in this case should include:  1. Differential diagnosis of the fever: Given the patient's cardiac history  the persistent fever and other systemic signs would prompt consideration for infective endocarditis.  2. Examination of the cardiovascular system: The medical students should specifically look for signs of infective endocarditis  such as a new or changed heart murmur  Janeway lesions  Osler's nodes  or Roth spots in the eyes.  3. Necessary investigations: Discuss the importance and frequency of blood cultures  the role of an ECG  chest X-ray  and echocardiogram in diagnosis.  4. Antibiotic therapy and need for surgical intervention: Discern when to apply antibiotics and the indications to refer the case to a cardiothoracic surgeon for valve replacement surgery.  5. Prognosis: Discuss the potential complications of infective endocarditis such as congestive heart failure  systemic embolism  and highlight the relevance of early detection and management.  5. Educate about the importance of dental hygiene and avoidance of specific triggers to prevent recurrent episodes.   This case will serve as a comprehensive guide 0 ensuring medical students cover all aspects of diagnosis  management  and prevention of native-valve infective endocarditis. The discussions surrounding the case will provide students valuable insight into the complexities encountered in diagnosing and managing infective endocarditis. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,14,Case Report:  Demographics: Mr. Rodriguez  a 53-year-old Hispanic male working as a manual laborer  presents to the clinic. He is a tobacco smoker but denies any use of illicit drugs. He's not on any regular medications and his immunization status is up-to-date.   Past Medical History: He had rheumatic fever at the age of 10  and was diagnosed with mitral valve stenosis in his adulthood. There are no known allergies. There's no history of substance abuse. His family history includes hypertension in his father and stroke in his mother.  Chief Complaints: Over the past three weeks  Mr. Rodriguez has been feeling fatigued with associated low-grade fever and night sweats. He also mentions a 5 kg unintentional weight loss over the same period. Recently  he has complained of dyspnea on exertion which has been progressively worsening.   In reviewing this case  it is important to note that native-valve endocarditis predominantly affects males  with higher prevalence in middle-aged and older adults. The burden of infective endocarditis is also found to be higher in some racial and ethnic groups  like the Hispanic population  due to various socioeconomic influences  cultural beliefs  healthcare accessibility and genetic predispositions. Rheumatic heart disease  tobacco smoking and previous valve diseases are known risk factors. Common symptoms such as fever  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss and dyspnea should always lead to further investigation for possible infective endocarditis in the appropriate clinical context.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,15,Case Study:  Patient Profile: Demographics: Caucasian male  62 years old  retired manual laborer  lives in the rural Midwest   Past Medical History: Diagnosed with mild hypertension 6 years ago  managed with lifestyle modifications. No history of heart disease  illicit drug use  dental procedures  or recent infections. Physical examination 2 years prior indicated no valvular heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was admitted to the outpatient department presenting with high-grade fever persisting for more than two weeks. The fever was associated with chills and rigors but not accompanied by any rash or night sweats. Over this period  the patient also reported progressive fatigue and unexplained weight loss. He noted occasional discomfort in the left upper quadrant of his abdomen but reported no recent changes in bowel habits or urine output. He also mentioned a new onset of fleeting  migrating joint pain  predominantly in the knees and elbows  which seemed unrelated to exertion.  On further enquiry  the patient reported no recent travel  animal contact  food poisoning  or any other specific event that might trigger his symptoms. His family history revealed that his father had passed away due to a stroke at 68  and mother had lived till 87 with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  The brief case report outlines key features of the patient's complaints  demographic  and medical history relevant to native-valve infective endocarditis. The inclusion of a relatively less common presentation would assist in broadening the differential diagnoses considered by medical students and prompt the need for comprehensive investigative work-up in febrile patients. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,16,Patient Information:  A 56-year-old Caucasian male  with a past medical history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) in his early adulthood and long-term smoker suffering from chronic bronchitis. He is currently under methadone maintenance therapy and living in a suburban area with his family.  Chief Complaint:  Patient presents to the emergency department complaining of unexplained fever  generalized fatigue  loss of appetite with occasional night sweats for the last two weeks. He also mentions a new onset of shortness of breath that has been progressively worsening over the last few days. He denies any recent IVDU.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient appears in moderate distress with clammy  pale skin. Vital signs show fever (38.7°C/101.6°F)  tachycardia at 112 bpm  and mild tachypnea at 22 breaths/min. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur on auscultation. Small erythematous lesions on his palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions  and several painless  small erythematous nodules on his fingers and toes  suspected to be Osler nodes.  Investigations: Blood cultures  chest X-ray  and echocardiography are advised to identify the presence of infective endocarditis and any potential complications. Also  some laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC)  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and tests for hepatitis B  C  and HIV considering his history of IVDU.  Differential diagnosis: Native-valve infective endocarditis  Rheumatic fever  Systemic lupus erythematosus.  This case mostly represents the most common demographics for native-valve infective endocarditis as seen in medical literature. It is more common in males than females  and people over 50 years old are at a higher risk. Furthermore  people with a history of IVDU are at significant risk  and endocarditis often affects the native valves in this group. It is also important to note the role of chronic conditions like bronchitis that can predispose to bacterial infections. As per literature  Staphylococcus aureus  including MRSA  is one of the most common organisms causing native valve endocarditis  particularly in patients with a history of drug use.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,17,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Training Case for Medical Students  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 55 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Profession: Gardener  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of intravenous (IV) drug use but is sober for the past 5 years. He also has Type II Diabetes  Hypertension  and occasional dental issues. He has a paternal family history of heart disease.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Johnson presents to the ER complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath  especially on exertion  that has been worsening over the past two weeks. He reports experiencing episodic low-grade fever with occasional night sweats and has lost around 10 pounds unintentionally. He also recalls having a dental cleaning one month prior to this episode  after which he suffered a mild periodontal infection for which he completed a course of oral antibiotics.  Examiner's notes: The focus of the case should orient the students towards the significant history of IV drug use  chronic dental issues and the recent dental procedure in combination with nonspecific but chronic symptoms. This history should guide them towards suspecting an infection of the heart valves  namely native-valve infective endocarditis  which might be confirmed by the presence of symptoms of heart failure  sepsis  or embolization and further investigation with imaging and blood cultures. Emphasize the importance of being vigilant about possible complications and considering endocarditis in cases with chronic symptoms and seemingly unrelated history of presenting illness.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,18,Case Report:      Patient Profile:      The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of lethargy  loss of appetite  increasing shortness of breath  fever  and weight loss over the past four weeks.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of intravenous drug use (heroin) but has been abstinent for several years. His past medical history is noteworthy for Hepatitis C infection contracted during his drug use months  untreated hypertension  and a dental procedure approximately two months prior with limited antibiotic prophylaxis due to the patient's reported penicillin allergy. He has no record of previous surgery  no known allergies except for penicillin  and no established care with a primary care physician due to lack of health insurance.  Presenting Complaints:     The patient's main symptoms include newly developed lethargy  loss of appetite  and shortness of breath. He also reports experiencing nocturnal diaphoresis and a weight loss of approximately 15 pounds in the last month. Worth noting are intermittent fevers  infrequent chills  and a low-grade persisting occasional cough.   Background Context:  This case presents a common clinical scenario for native valve infective endocarditis in the developed world  particularly among populations with a history of intravenous drug use. The patient's symptoms have been ongoing for an extended period  and he is at risk of developing more severe complications caused by the condition. With high-risk factors such as untreated hypertension  Hepatitis C infection  history of drug use  poor dental hygiene  and recent dental work  this patient is at a higher likelihood of developing infective endocarditis.  According to literature  Infective Endocarditis (IE) affects mostly men (2:1 ratio) and tends to peak in the 5th to 7th decade of life  making our patient demographic appropriate. The described social background and medical history  such as intravenous drug use  and predisposing heart condition also align with the most frequently reported risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,19,Patient Case:  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 62-year-old African-American male  who lives in an urban area and is a former IV drug user.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C and hypertension. He has been sober for 15 years but used injectable heroin for 20 years prior. He has no history of heart disease  diabetes  or other significant medical conditions.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents to the clinic with a three-week history of fever  chills  and fatigue. The fever spikes in the late afternoon and is often accompanied by night sweats. He also complains of recent onset of shortness of breath on exertion and a painful  swollen  red lump on his right elbow  which he assumes is a spider bite. His appetite has decreased lately and he reports unintentional weight loss. He denies chest pain  cough  or other localizing symptoms. He has not noticed any changes in his urine or stool color.  This case is designed to represent a typical case of a patient who might present with native-valve infective endocarditis. The risk factors for this patient include his history of IV drug use. The features of possible septic arthritis or immune complex deposition (represented by the lump on the elbow)  the evidence of systemic illness (weight loss  fatigue)  and the presentation with a persistent fever are all consistent with this diagnosis. This case should provoke thought about the need for further investigation with blood cultures and possibly imaging of the heart.   African-American males have been found to have a higher incidence of native-valve infective endocarditis  with IV drug users making up a significant proportion of these patients. Public health interventions have reduced the incidence of endocarditis among IV drug users  but it remains a significant risk factor  particularly in those with a long history of use. The incidence of native-valve endocarditis is also somewhat higher in urban areas. The age of the patient reflects the fact that endocarditis typically affects adults  but can occur at any age.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,20,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  a smoker with a history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and mild Hypertension.  Demographic Considerations: Given that infective endocarditis most often occurs in males aged 30 to 60 and that Caucasians are at an elevated risk  this patient presentation reflects a demographic group that is disproportionately affected. Furthermore  a history of smoking  DM  and hypertension are common comorbidities associated with endocarditis  encompassing a broad range of pathophysiology and clinical situations that a student might encounter.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Type-2 DM a decade ago and has kept it under control with regular medication. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has a history of mild hypertension. There isn't any history of any congenital heart defects  rheumatic heart disease  or intravenous drug use. The patient has undergone no prior surgeries. Family history is unremarkable.  Chief Complaint: Patient presents with a 2-week history of intermittent low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and night sweats. Over the past few days  he has also noticed that small  reddish spots have appeared on his skin and the whites of his eyes appear slightly yellow.   This case should lead the student to consider infective endocarditis early on  given the constellation of vague constitutional symptoms (fever  fatigue  loss of appetite) as well as the more specific findings of petechiae and subtle jaundice. The patient's past medical history of DM and smoking provides cardiovascular risk factors and avenues for deeper studies into the pathogenesis. While this patient does not feature any direct risks for endocarditis such as intravenous drug use or a history of valvular disease  his presentation can help educate students on the fact that endocarditis can still occur outside of these direct risks  particularly in the presence of other  more indirect cardiovascular risks.   Here  students can discuss common pathogens leading to endocarditis and relevant diagnostic workups  including the importance of blood cultures and echocardiography. The therapeutic interventions such as the choice of antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention criteria can also be discussed.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,21,Case Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male   Patient Information: Mr. Patrick Alone  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department with persistent  unexplained fever  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the past 2 months.  Past Medical History: He has a past medical history of untreated type 2 diabetes  hypertension and a lifelong smoking habit. Ten years prior  he was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent dental extraction 2 months ago. He has no history of drug abuse or intravenous drug use. His medications include metformin and amlodipine.  Key Complaints: 1. Febrile episodes for the past 2 months  described as high-grade  intermittent fever with chills. 2. Generalized weakness and malaise that progressively worsened over the past few weeks. 3. Significant weight loss (approximately 15 pounds) over the past 2 months. 4. Shortness of breath  especially on exertion  which he initially associated with his COPD  but it seems to have increased recently. 5. Occasional night sweats.  Note: The presentation of infective endocarditis can be atypical in elderly patients with multiple comorbid conditions. While intravenous drug use is a well-recognized risk factor for infective endocarditis  non-IV drug users may also develop this condition  particularly those with poor dental hygiene  a condition which our patient fits given his history of dental extraction. It is essential for trainees to bear in mind that a high degree of suspicion is often required to diagnose infective endocarditis timely  given its insidious presentation.   Objective: This case is intended to help trainees recognize and appreciate the complexity and variability of clinical presentations in infective endocarditis  particularly among older patients with comorbidities. Moreover  this case is also designed to reinforce the importance of detailed history taking and conducting a thorough physical examination in diagnosing this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,22,Case Report: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: Mr. Antonio Martinez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male who resides in a suburban setting. He is a retired electrician who lives with his 65-year-old wife. He enjoys fishing  gardening  and spending time with his grandchildren. He is an ex-smoker (quit 23 years ago) and drinks alcohol moderately. He is not known to use recreational drugs.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martinez has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  of which he's been managing with metformin for the past 10 years. He also has Hypertension controlled with lisinopril. He has no known allergies. He had an appendectomy in his 30s and has been relatively healthy until now. No noted history of valve disease  rheumatic heart disease  or intravenous drug use. He does  however  have poor dental hygiene.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Martinez presents to the emergency room with a three-week history of generalized body weakness  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss (around 12 lbs in a month). He complains of persistent low-grade fever which does not seem to reduce in any significant way by taking over-the-counter paracetamol. He also mentions night sweats and occasional chills. He has been experiencing increased shortness of breath  especially during trivial activities. There has been reduced appetite and intermittent nausea. He has noted leg swelling for the past two days. He denies any chest pain or discomfort  cough  or urinary symptoms.  Upon further inquiry  he reveals that he had recently (about a month ago) undergone a dental extraction which was done at a local community health fair. He noticed that it took longer for the bleeding to stop  and the site was painful and uncomfortable for a few days. However  he relates these issues to his old age and did not seek follow up.  This comprehensive case looks into native-valve infective endocarditis  relevant to both racial/ethnic and age demographics  and the prevalence of occurrence in patients without a known history of valve disease  but who may be exposed to risk factors such as invasive dental procedures without appropriate prophylaxis. The case is designed to guide students to investigate beyond the common to a more serious condition that might initially present with rather generalized and non-specific symptoms.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,23,Case Scenario:  Patient Profile:  Mr. Garcia  a 58-year-old Hispanic male construction worker  walks into the clinic.   Past Medical History: He has a history of poorly controlled type two diabetes mellitus and a recent dental procedure performed three weeks ago. He has been non-compliant with his diabetes medication due to his lack of health literacy. His parents both suffered from cardiovascular diseases  but no history of congenital heart diseases in the family. No history of IV drug use.   Key Complaints: He presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  night sweats  and weight loss. He also complains of increasing fatigue  muscle aches  and intermittent episodes of shortness of breath. Over the past few days  he also noticed a new rash on his legs and blood in his urine.  Discussion:  This case is fitting for teaching about native valve infective endocarditis. The patient’s presentation is typical of subacute endocarditis with the persistent unexplained fever  symptoms of systemic illness like night sweats  weight loss  fatigue  and the new vascular phenomena like rash and hematuria.  One important hint towards infective endocarditis in the history is the recent dental procedure. Instrumentation during dental procedures can lead to transient bacteremia  especially in patients who didn't take prophylactic antibiotics. Also noteworthy is the patient's poorly controlled diabetes  which can compromise his immunity and increase susceptibility to infections.  This case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive history taking and considering infective endocarditis in patients with unexplained fever  especially when there are other suggestive features or risk factors like poor dental hygiene  recent invasive procedures  or inadequate glycemic control.  The next steps in assessment would involve physical examination looking for classic signs of endocarditis like Janeway lesions  Osler nodes  or Roth spots  etc. Investigations would include blood cultures and echocardiography. Proper management will then follow depending on the results.   Finally  this case involves a Hispanic male  representative of a demographic that is less represented in medical literature but does not show a lower incidence of infective endocarditis. This points towards the need for inclusivity and awareness about health issues across all racial and ethnic groups. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,24,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male from an urban location. He is a retired elementary school teacher who lives with his wife. He has a history of occasional alcohol consumption and smokes 10 cigarettes a day.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of rheumatic fever as a child. He was diagnosed with mild mitral stenosis in his 40s but the condition remained stable with no significant issues. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 55 and is managed on Metformin. There is no history of intravenous drug use or recent dental procedures. His father passed due to cardiovascular complications in his early 60s.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented at the hospital with a 2-week history of fatigue  shortness of breath  low-grade fever  and night sweats. He mentioned recent unintentional weight loss along with loss of appetite. He also reported having noticeable discomfort in his joints and a persistent  new heart murmur that was non-existent before.  This case was designed with current demographic representation of infective endocarditis in mind. The literature suggests that infective endocarditis is most common in men in their late 50s or early 60s  with a history of valvular heart disease or other structural heart disease  and a risk factor of smoking or occasional alcohol use. The presence of diabetes increases the susceptibility due to impaired immune system. The key complaints including fatigue  low grade fever  night sweats  and a new cardiac murmur are indicative of a subacute course of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,25,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics and Past Medical History: Patient Name: Patient X (anonymized for privacy) Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Construction Worker Insurance: Medicare Residence: Urban suburb in the Pacific Northwest  Past medical history: - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) related to history of smoking (20 pack-years)  quit five years ago - Hypertension (HTN) controlled with medication - Excessive alcohol intake in the past but stopped 2 years ago - History of intravenous drug use (IVDU) 30 years ago with long-term recovery  - No known drug allergies  Presenting Complaints: Mr. X presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of persistent  low-grade fever (T max 100.4°F)  recent episodes of night sweats  and weight loss of about 7 lbs over the last 6 weeks. He also complains of intermittent shortness of breath  worse on exertion and a progredient issue of fatigue. He noticed the presence of blood in his urine this morning  which prompted his visit.   NOTE: This case description aligns with available published data that demonstrates a higher prevalence of infective endocarditis among older males  often related to a history of IVDU or alcoholism  as well as common comorbidities of chronic illnesses such as COPD and hypertension. While the geographical location may not play a significant role in the development of infectious endocarditis  stating it contributes to a holistic approach to patient care.   The main symptoms characteristic for infective endocarditis - fevor  weight loss  night sweat  and possible hematuria - have been included. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,26,Case Report  Patient Information:   A 58-year-old African American male who is currently a shift worker in a chemical factory. He is unmarried and lives alone.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse  primarily heroin  up until about 10 years ago. He was involved in a substance abuse treatment program and since then manages to stay clean. He has a history of intermittent dental abscesses  poor dental hygiene  and has not seen a dentist in five years. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from prolonged tobacco use (40 pack-years).   Presenting Complaints:  Over the past two weeks  the patient has been feeling malaise  fatigue  and has seen a low-grade fever (38-38.5°C). He also reports discomfort in his chest  specifically a dull aching pain  along with shortness of breath exacerbation during his normal COPD symptoms. He also notes he's had night sweats and experienced unintended weight loss  lacks appetite but does not report any nausea or vomiting.  The case of a 58-year-old African American male with a history of intravenous drug use  poor dental hygiene  and COPD presenting with malaise  low-grade fever  night sweats  unintentional weight loss  and increased dyspnea represents a typical case of native-valve infective endocarditis. This case is designed with an appropriate demographic in mind and incorporates several risk factors associated with endocarditis such as intravenous drug use  poor dental hygiene  and a history of respiratory disorders.  This case prompts students to think about the relation between the patient's past medical history  the presenting complaints  and the possible diagnosis of infective endocarditis. It can facilitate the discussion about the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms  clinical features  diagnostic work-ups  management  and prevention strategies of native valve infective endocarditis. Additionally  the case helps emphasize the comprehensive approach needed in managing patients with multiple comorbid conditions.   
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,27,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs. Susan Rodriguez  Age: 55 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino Occupation: Teacher Location: Urban area  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Rodriguez has a 15-year history of rheumatic heart disease which resulted in moderate aortic stenosis. She never had any surgical intervention or replacement procedures due to her controlled condition. She is on a regular course of metoprolol and aspirin.   Key Complaints:  Mrs. Rodriguez visited her family doctor complaining of low-grade fever lasting for about three weeks accompanied by chills and night sweats. She also reported persistent fatigue and lethargy  weight loss without changes in her eating habits  and a new onset of a heart murmur detected by her primary care physician. On more detailed questioning  she admitted to experiencing an intermittent  dull chest pain  close to her heart  for about a week. She had also noted reddish-pink spots (petechiae) on her skin  predominantly on her palms and soles. Of note  she had a dental procedure about five weeks ago.  Rational for case design:  Infective endocarditis predominantly affects individuals with pre-existing heart conditions  including rheumatic heart disease. The typical age of presentation is between 30 and 60 years  and there have been numerous studies indicating a slight propensity towards males - however  female cases are still significant. A 2017 study in the Journal of American College of Cardiology indicates Hispanics bear a high burden of cardiovascular diseases  including infective endocarditis  and hence the demographic representation.  The case emphasizes the importance of recognizing non-specific symptoms and signs of endocarditis  such as fever  fatigue  weight loss  and heart murmurs. The risk associated with dental procedures and onset of infective endocarditis is also highlighted by this case. The timing and description of symptoms are typical for native-valve infective endocarditis  which is usually subacute in nature.   This case should enable students to learn how to recognize and approach suspected cases of infective endocarditis  appreciate its risk factors  understand the importance of in-depth history taking  and also provide a platform to discuss the underlying pathophysiology.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,28,Patient Profile:  Name: Maria Gonzalez Gender: Age: 60 Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Setting: Urban  Past Medical History:  - Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago  managed with metformin. - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  on Lisinopril. - She had a dental procedure (tooth extraction) a month ago.  Chief Complaint:  - Presented with intermittent fever for 2 weeks  - Fatigue  - Weight loss  - Moderate to severe joint aches  Effects on Daily Life:  - Maria reports extreme fatigue and weakness  leaving her unable to perform her daily activities. - She also reports loss of appetite  leading to unintentional weight loss.  Clinical Examination:  - Temperature: 100.8°F (38.2°C) - Heart Rate: 110 bpm  - Blood pressure: 140/85 mmHg - On auscultation: a new heart murmur heard  This case presentation avails a rich training opportunity geared towards the diagnosis  investigation  differential diagnosis  and management of native valve infective endocarditis. It also incorporates important elements such as the consideration of oral-dental procedures as potential sources of infection  risk factors in the elderly  and clinical manifestation of infective endocarditis in the background of other comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,29,Patient Profile  Name: Mr. Sandoval Age: 65 Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic Gender: Male Occupation: Retired  previously worked in construction  Past Medical History 1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 2. Previous diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever in late adulthood.  Chief Complaints 1. Persistent high-grade fever for the past 10 days. 2. Experiencing fatigue and weakness. 3. Onset of shortness of breath even on minor exertion. 4. Unexplained weight loss. 5. Observing blood in urine.  This case reflects a patient who belongs to one of the high-risk populations for native-valve infective endocarditis - those with a history of rheumatic heart disease. The patient’s complaints are indicative of possible infective endocarditis  in combination with potential complicating factors (e.g. chronic disease state like diabetes). Studies indicate the disease is more common in older adults  with the average age of diagnosis around 60 years. It is also reported that men are more likely than women to develop this condition. Lastly  it also emphasizes the increased susceptibility of infective endocarditis in the Hispanic population  as referenced in the literature. This case is intended to stimulate discussion around risk factors  signs and symptoms  diagnosis  and the treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,30,Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. Johnson (hypothetical patient to maintain confidentiality)   Age: 60 years old  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Living Status: Lives alone in a rural setup   Occupation: Retired farmer   Case Information:  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  adequately controlled on metformin. He also has mild hypertension  controlled with ACE inhibitors. He had a dental procedure a month ago due to a tooth abscess.  Key Complaints: He's experiencing moderate to high fevers irregularly for the past three weeks. He also complains of fatigue  headache  weight loss  chills  and skin petechiae. There's a shortness of breath and occasional chest pain during exertion. A critical complaint is a new onset mild regurgitation heard during the chest auscultation.  Infective endocarditis is more common in males and older adults  with a median age of diagnosis around 58 years  according to the European Heart Journal. The disease has been associated with certain heart conditions and risk factors such as diabetes and invasive dental procedures. In this case  we've included the dental procedure as a precipitating event and other common symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis like fevers  fatigue  and new onset murmur. It's also important to highlight the morbidity factor of residing in rural settings due to a potential delay in diagnosis and treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,31,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 55-year-old Hispanic male  owner of a gardening company  presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of progressive fatigue  low-grade fever  night sweats  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss. He noted a change in skin color to be slightly more yellow and also observed occasional drops of blood in his urine. He is married with two kids and lives in a suburban area. He does not smoke  occasionally drinks alcohol  and denies any drug usage.  Past Medical History: His past medical history revealed that Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with rheumatic fever during his childhood. As a consequence  he has been dealing with mild mitral valve regurgitation for the last 20 years. However  he had been asymptomatic and was not taking any regular medications. His immunizations  including pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations  were up to date. His other routine screenings  such as diabetes  cholesterol  and colonoscopy were generally within normal range. His mother had hypertension and his father had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Key Complaints:  The primary complaints include fever  malaise  anorexia  night sweats  mild jaundice  and hematuria. He is particularly disturbed by the persistent low-grade fever that refuses to abate  and the systemic fatigue and weakness that are making it difficult for him to function. He also noted a decreased appetite and increasing night sweats that are affecting his quality of life.  This case can pave the way to discuss the manifestations of infective endocarditis and how it may present with non-specific symptoms like fever  night sweats  and fatigue  which can often be confused with other conditions. The history of rheumatic fever and resultant heart disease could be an important point to introduce the concept of predisposing risk factors for endocarditis.   It may also open a discussion about demographic and socio-economic factors involved in developing infective endocarditis  such as the higher rate of incidence among males  and the role of age  ethnicity  and access to healthcare. This patient's case promotes understanding of how to approach investigations and management of a case of suspected native-valve infective endocarditis.  
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,32,Case Report  Demographics: Patient Name: Mr. Samuel Montgomery Age: 53 Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Teacher Location: Urban Area of Detroit  Michigan  Past Medical History: Mr. Montgomery has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he has been on metformin for the past 10 years. He has been fairly controlled and has no late diabetes complications. His other medical history includes two dental procedures in the past year for gum disease and a root canal. He is known hypertensive  controlled with lisinopril. Mr. Montgomery does not lead an active lifestyle and his daily food consumption often exceeds the recommended portions for his condition. He does not smoke  but admits to moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaints: For about 3 weeks now  Mr. Montgomery has been experiencing on-and-off fever  getting as high as 102°F. He has also been complaining of chills  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and joint/muscle aches. He has noticed a few red tender spots on his palms and soles and small painful red bumps on his fingers and toes. For the past one week  he complains of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain  particularly when lying flat.  Upon reading literature  a similar range of demographics was found where individuals over the age of 50  especially those with a history of diabetes  hypertension  dental procedures  and indulging in unhealthy lifestyles  were found to be more prone to native-valve infective endocarditis. Therefore  it is important for medical students treating such patients to include it in their differential diagnosis when encountering similar presenting complaints and histories. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,33,Patient Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Demographics: Patient: Mrs. Patricia Sanchez Gender: Female Age: 62 years old Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Past Medical History: Mrs. Sanchez has a history of Type II diabetes and is currently on metformin. She also has well-controlled hypertension with losartan. Patricia underwent dental surgery for periodontitis two months ago. She does not have a history of IV drug abuse  recent travel  or autoimmune disorders. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  Presenting Complaints: Over the past three weeks  she began feeling fatigued and experienced a weight loss of 8 pounds not related to any dietary changes. Patricia also noted that she had been running a low-grade fever and experiencing night sweats intermittently. She also complained of a new onset weakness in her left leg. For her last three days  she recognized petechial hemorrhages under the nails of her right hand.  Clinical Examination: On examination  slight pallor was apparent  and a new systolic murmur was detected at the left lower sternal border. Moreover  she experienced mild tenderness on palpation of the left calf muscle.  Note: This case of a 62-year-old Hispanic woman  Mrs. Sanchez  having potential for native-valve infective endocarditis has been prepared considering the actual literature-based demographics. According to data  infective endocarditis tends to be more common in men; however  it also affects post-menopausal women  particularly those with a history of valvular heart disease. However  the presentation can also be seen in those without a prior history of heart conditions  especially when there has been a recent invasive procedure  similar characteristic to our case. Remember  a complete history  careful physical examination alongside pertinent investigation  is vital for diagnosing endocarditis which had a myriad of systemic manifestations.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,34,Case Report for Training:  Patient's Demographics: The patient is a 57-year-old African-American male who is a smoker and heavy drinker. He works as a janitor  and his income is below the poverty level.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of rheumatic fever during his childhood but never had any surgery or heart anomaly identified. He has been diagnosed with uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus for the past ten years and converted hepatitis C of unknown duration. Furthermore  the patient has a 25-year history of tobacco smoking equivalent to 50 pack-years and chronic alcohol use.  Key Complaints:  He presents with a 3 weeks history of persistent fever with daily temperature peaking at 39 degrees Celsius. He also reports progressive fatigue  unintended weight loss of about 20 pounds over the past month  and occasional night sweats. A new  isolateral headache has started recently. Moreover  he also complains of night blindness and increasing difficulty in picking up objects with his right hand for the past week.  Upon further questioning  he mentions that he's been having a deep  sharp  intermittent  lower retrosternal chest pain for the past week. The patient denies having any cough  dyspnea  abdominal pain  diarrhea  or urinary symptoms.   This case scenario represents a typical patient at risk for endocarditis  taking into account the demographic data available in medical literature pointing towards a higher prevalence among middle-aged men  smokers  alcoholics  immunocompromised individuals (Hep C)  and lower economic strata. This choice of patient demographic aims to allow medical students to establish the correlation between these risk factors and the presented case and develop their capability of making accurate diagnoses based on thorough assessments.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,35,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information:  - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse up until about fifteen years ago but has been clean since enrolling in a rehabilitation program. He has also been documented with chronic hepatitis C contracted during his years of drug usage. Additionally  the patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and mild hyperlipidemia  both of which are being managed by lifestyle modifications and medication.  Key Presenting Complaints:  The patient has come in complaining of persistent  low-grade fever for two weeks  which has not subsided with over-the-counter medication. He has also expressed feeling unusually fatigued throughout this period  with loss of appetite and weight. Recently  he has also noticed mild swelling in his feet and ankles. He reports experiencing shortness of breath  in particular after climbing stairs or walking a long distance  which he earlier used to do so without difficulty.  There is no history of chest pain  cough  or other respiratory symptoms. He denies any newer changes in his bowel or urinary habits. The patient has been adherent to his hypertensive and hyperlipidemic treatment  and there have been no recent changes in his medications.  Note: The patient's age  sex  and ethnicity have been chosen as they are representative of demographics where valvular heart disease and subsequent infective endocarditis occurrence are more commonly found in literature. The history of IV drug abuse is included as this is a known risk factor for infective endocarditis. Chronic hepatitis C  while potentially related to IV drug use history  is also included as it can pose additional challenges in patient management. Other comorbidities like hypertension and hyperlipidemia have been added to add complexity to the case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,36,"Case Study: Title: """"An Unexpected Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis""""  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Thompson is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired truck driver. He is a resident of a suburban area  married with three children. He occasionally consumes alcohol  in the form of a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week  and he quit smoking cigarettes 10 years ago after a pack-a-day habit for 35 years. He has a history of non-compliance to medications and infrequent medical check-ups due to his previous traveling work lifestyle.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a significant medical history of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus since the age of 53. He also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia - conditions that he was diagnosed with five years back. His family history is positive for ischemic heart disease. Despite these medical conditions  he has been free from chronic or recurrent infections in the past.  Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson presents with six days of malaise  low-grade fever  night sweats  and a recent loss of appetite causing abrupt weight loss. He also complains of a constant dull-ache in the middle of his chest. A new symptom he has noticed is shortness of breath while performing daily activities  something which he did not experience earlier. He also casually mentions that he has been noticing more bleeding while brushing his teeth lately.  Objective: The objective of this case study is to make young learners aware of the cardinal symptoms and history which raise suspicion towards infective endocarditis in at-risk population  their identification  and clinical relevance.  Takeaway: This case is an example of how infective endocarditis can present in an individual with pre-existing conditions that predispose him to develop such infections. Early recognition and prompt management are crucial to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with native-valve infective endocarditis. This case also provides information regarding the symptoms of infective endocarditis which will help in the early identification of the disease.   Note: Though this case study represents a commonly encountered clinical scenario  please bear in mind that infective endocarditis can occur even in people without significant past medical history or epidemiological risk factors. Also  though men are generally more affected as per the literature  it must be noted that women are also susceptible to this condition."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,37,Patient Information: Mr. Philip Hudson  a 50-year-old Caucasian male is currently employed as a farmer in a rural community. He lives on his farm with his wife and two children.   Past Medical History: Mr. Hudson has a past medical history of moderate dental decay requiring multiple extractions and fillings but has not sought dental care for the past 4 years due to financial constraints. He reports a 20-pack year smoking history  but quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure  for which he is taking medication. He has no known drug allergies. His immunizations are up to date and he has no history of illicit drug use or hospitalization.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Hudson came to the hospital  complaining of severe fatigue  fever of 38.5°C that has persisted for almost three weeks  and unintended weight loss of about 10 pounds over the same period. He reports noticing fingernail changes (splinter hemorrhages) and an unusual red  painless rash on his legs. He also mentions experiencing intermittent night sweats and mild shortness of breath.  Physical examination findings suggest potential Janeway lesions. On cardiovascular examination  the provider notes a harsh murmur  best heard at the left lower sternal border. His dental examination reveals severe dental caries and periodontal disease with visible inflammation.  In this scenario  Mr. Hudson's prolonged fever  weight loss  cardiac murmur  and cutaneous manifestations along with a pertinent history of poor dental health suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis  warranting further diagnostic tests  including blood cultures and echocardiography.   Reflecting the epidemiological data  the patient represents the demographic who are at a higher risk of native-valve endocarditis  specifically middle-aged males with poor dental health  even without a history of intravenous drug use. This case outlines the importance of considering endocarditis in patients demonstrating non-specific symptoms along with evidence of end organ damage  even in the absence of traditional risk factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,38,Patient Profile: Name: James Martinez Age: 54 Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Factory worker Location: Urban city setting  Past Medical History: Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 7 years ago  Diagnosed with Hypertension 5 years ago Recent dental surgery 2 weeks ago Illicit drug abuse (heroin): 15 years (in recovery - last use approx. 5 years ago)  Presenting Complaints: Over the last one week  Mr. Martinez has been complaining of 1. General malaise 2. High-grade intermittent fever with chills and night sweats 3. Fatigue 4. Mild shortness of breath  particularly on exertion 5. Subtle weight loss 6. Vague chest discomfort  described as a dull ache  Background:  Infective endocarditis  despite being rare  largely affects individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions  or those exposed to certain risk factors. Diabetes and illicit drug use are known risk factors  as well as recent dental procedures. This case represents a patient at high risk due to his pre-existing conditions and history of illicit drug use. The demographics show this is an urban Hispanic male which not only represents a significant portion of US population but also addresses health disparities occurring among racial and ethnic minorities. According to the CDC  Hispanic people are at a higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension  risk factors for infective endocarditis. Furthermore  the use of intravenous drugs  another risk factor  is prevalent across metropolitan areas.   The students should be educated on recognizing these risk factors early on to suspect infective endocarditis and initiate timely investigations. Similarly  the case ideally highlights the importance of patient counseling regarding oral hygiene  especially in those having undergone dental procedures. It is indicative of the multiple opportunities available for introducing preventive measures. In this way  the case emphasizes a holistic approach that considers epidemiology  social determinants  and prevention along with the pathophysiology and treatment of the disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,39,Patient Case:    Demographics: 67-year-old African-American male  Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type II (managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications) and Hypertension (managed with Lisinopril)  both medical conditions have been under control for over a decade. Patient has a 30-pack year history of smoking  but quit 15 years ago. Patient also admits to a long history of poor dental hygiene  with infrequent dental visits. He had rheumatic fever as a child.  Chief Complaints: Patient presents to the hospital with a two-week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and an unintentional weight loss of around 10 pounds over this period. More recently  the patient states he has experienced intermittent  sharp chest pain radiating to his left arm  with associated shortness of breath.  Such demographic representation aligns with literature suggesting  infective endocarditis  a deadly infection of the heart valves  tends to be diagnosed more frequently among elderly male patients with a history of chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Moreover  smoking and poor dental hygiene serve as significant risk factors. Symptoms often start subtly  and may include nonspecific complaints like low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss.                                         -The case also underlines the connection between cardiopulmonary symptoms and infective endocarditis  which serious students must learn to potentially diagnose this condition earlier in similar at-risk patient groups.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,40,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient demographics:  The patient is a 56-year-old White male from a rural  low socio-economic background. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history and an occasional heavy alcohol drinker. His occupation requires long hours of manual labour  which hasn't changed since he immigrated to the United States 25 years ago.   Past medical history:  The patient has a history of moderate persistent asthma  controlled with the use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a short-acting beta-2 agonist as needed. He was diagnosed with hypertension two years ago  which has been managed with amlodipine 10mg daily. The patient was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes but has been noncompliant with metformin therapy and dietary modifications. There are no known drug allergies. He does not have any known history of heart disease in the family.  Presenting complaints:  The patient presents with symptoms that have gradually worsened over the past four weeks. He initially noticed a few days of nonspecific malaise and low-grade fever. Over the following week  he experienced increased fatigue  night sweats  small joint arthralgias  and unexplained weight loss.   Over the previous week  he also reported a new onset of a heart murmur described as a new harsh midsystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border  shortness of breath on exertion  and weakness.   Physical examination revealed several conjunctival hemorrhages  tender nodules on the pads of his fingers and toes (Osler's nodes)  and small  painless red or purplish skin lesions on his palms and soles (Janeway's lesions).  These symptoms  alongside the patient's history and socio-economic background  should lead to initial investigations to confirm suspicions of native-valve infective endocarditis. It will be essential to use this case to educate students on recognizing the signs and symptoms of this disease and understanding the importance of early detection and treatment. This case will help students learn and apply appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment guidelines.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,41,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Complaints: Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of fever  fatigue  night sweats  and weight loss. He also reported a new onset of mild chest discomfort and a shortness of breath that has been progressively getting worse.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is diabetic and hypertensive for the last 12 years. These conditions were well-managed with Metformin (500mg BD) and Lisinopril (10mg daily). He had a dental procedure around 5 weeks ago. He quit alcohol 10 years back and has never smoked. He showed good adherence to his medication schedule.  Justification for Patient Selection: Infective endocarditis (IE) is most likely to arise in persons over 60 years old  with men being affected 1.5 times more frequently than women  according to literature. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are also risk factors associated with IE.  Main Focus of the Case:  This case centers on Mr. Doe's subsequent diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  focusing on his risk factors (age  sex  comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension  recent dental procedure)  symptoms  effective diagnosis  and the complexities of treatment strategies in patients with preexisting conditions like his. It provides an opportunity to understand the mechanisms  susceptibility factors  and presentation of infective endocarditis  along with its implications on the heart valves. It also placing strong emphasis on the importance of early recognition and timely intervention.   Relevance of the Case to Medical Education: Infective endocarditis is a serious condition that  if untreated  can lead to severe complications and has a high rate of mortality. For medical students  this case teaches the importance of gaining comprehensive patient history and recognizing the symptoms that  although may appear non-specific (fever  fatigue  weight loss)  combined with certain risk factors can point towards a life-threatening condition such as infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,42,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. J is a 58-year-old African American male employed as a janitorial worker. He is from a middle-class socio-economic background and lives with his wife in the urban settings of Atlanta  GA. He has a history of tobacco and alcohol use.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years  for which he takes Metformin. His other significant medical history includes hypertension  for which he is on Lisinopril  and stage IIIb chronic kidney disease. He lacks any familial history of heart diseases. He has no known allergies and underwent an appendectomy 30 years ago.   Key Complaints:   Mr. J presented to the emergency department complaining of a high-grade fever of 102°F  sweating  malaise  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss over the past 15 days. He also reports experiencing a reduced appetite  general body aches  and a new heart murmur detected by his primary health care provider during a routine follow-up. He also mentioned an episode of hemoptysis a few days ago.  Justification:   The demographic information and background are in line with literature findings that noted endocarditis more frequently in males  middle-aged adults  African Americans  people with lower-income occupations  and urban populations (Slipczuk L. et al.  2013). High prevalence is also found in patients with underlying diseases like diabetes  hypertension  or kidney disease  making Mr. J a typical patient (Bor DH. Et al.  1992). The complaints listed are common in patients with native-valve infective endocarditis  including fever  fatigue  weight loss  heart murmur  and hemoptysis associated with pulmonary embolism (Baddour LM. Et al.  2005).   References:  - Slipczuk L  Codolosa JN  Davila CD. Infective endocarditis epidemiology over five decades: a systematic review.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,43,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. Hernandez Age: 59 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Past Medical History:  Mr. Hernandez  a 59-year-old Hispanic male  presents with a known history of intravenous drug use (IVDU). He also has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes that is moderately controlled on gliclazide and metformin. His background history also highlights chronic hepatitis C infection which remains untreated. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Hernandez arrived at the emergency department complaining of a one week history of increasing shortness of breath  malaise  and unintentional weight loss. Additionally  he reported a low-grade fever lasting for the same duration. On closer inquiry  he also admitted to experiencing night sweats and a recent loss of appetite.  Recently  Mr. Hernandez noticed a few red  painful spots on his fingers and toes. He also states that his urine appeared darker than usual. He denied having cough  chest pain  nausea  vomiting  hemoptysis  joint pains  or any recent injury. He has no travel history in the past six months.  Given his past medical history and current complaints  the medical team is keeping a strong clinical suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis  especially as IVDU puts him at a significantly higher risk. Further diagnostic work-up including blood cultures  complete blood counts  a chest x-ray  and an echocardiogram will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.  This training case would serve to help students understand the early signs and symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis  the importance of taking a thorough history and the role that social and behavioral factors (such as IVDU) can play in contributing to illness. Additionally  it highlights the need for rapid diagnostic work-up in patients with similar presentations.  Reference: Baddour  et al. (2015).

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,44,Patient Information: 56-year-old Hispanic male  married  construction worker  residing in Brooklyn  New York  non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Known hypertensive for the last 10 years  well controlled on medication. No known allergies to drugs. He has no history of illicit drug use  no surgical history  and no known familial diseases.   Chief Complaints: Presented in the emergency room with a 10-day history of fever  fatigue  decreased appetite  weight loss  night sweats  and a new onset of progressive exertional dyspnea. He also complained of intermittent right-sided joint pain in his knee and ankle. He reported having dental cleaning done approximately 4 weeks ago without prophylactic antibiotics.   It should be noted that Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease with a predilection towards the male gender (62-65%). Although it can affect people of all age groups  persons aged 50-70 years old are particularly vulnerable  with a median age of approximately 58 years old. Additionally  infective endocarditis shows a particular racial/ethnic predisposition  with non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics being overrepresented compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Risk factors such as poor oral health  invasive dental procedures without antibiotic prophylaxis  and alcoholism  particularly in the lower socioeconomic classes like construction workers  should be considered in this context. Although intravenous drug use (IVDU) is a strong risk factor for IE  our patient reports no such history.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,45,Case Report:  Demographics:  Patient is a 67-year-old Hispanic-American male  employed as a construction worker.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of type II diabetes mellitus and has been non-compliant with his antidiabetic medications. He also has high blood pressure under control with medication and has had periodontal disease. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. His family history reveals cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.  Chief Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of intermittent fevers peaking at 38.5°C for the past two weeks  accompanied by unintentional weight loss (around 7 pounds in two weeks) and increasing fatigue. He also reported a recent onset of a new heart murmur and experiencing night sweats  although no cough  shortness of breath or chest pain. He also divulged that he occasionally had trouble maintaining balance while walking  suggesting possible central nervous system involvement.  It's important to mention that the incidence of infective endocarditis is particularly representative in the male population and is most frequently encountered among individuals aged 60 years and older. The case study represents the typical demographic while taking into account potential risk factors such as employment status and related exposure and chronic systemic diseases. The chronic uncontrolled diabetes and periodontal disease serve as potential sources of bacteremia seeding valvular vegetation. The early recognition of systemic features are key in such presentations as prompt management can drastically alter the prognostic and outcome trajectory among patients.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,46,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 60 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been living with Type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years. He is a former smoker  having quit smoking around 10 years ago  and has a history of battling with drug addiction  particularly heroin  that was successfully brought under control through rehabilitation and remains clean for 6 years. He also underwent a dental procedure about 2 months ago.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents with complaints of persistent and high-grade fever for the past 2 weeks. Accompanying the fever  he also reports experiencing fatigue  shortness of breath  unexplained weight loss  a decline in appetite  night sweats and occasional episodes of chills. He also mentions seeing blood in his urine recently.  (Note: The age of the patient and his history of drug use are according to the articles suggesting infective endocarditis is more commonly found in older patients and ones with intravenous drug use. The preceding dental procedures mentioned can be an important clue due to the possible dissemination of oral bacteria into the bloodstream during such procedures.)  Key Learning Objectives from the Case:    - Understand the clinical presentation of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis and learn to correlate it with the patient's presenting symptoms. - Highlight the importance of comprehensive history-taking in diagnosing conditions like infective endocarditis. - Emphasize on the need for considering predisposing factors such as intravenous drug use  pre-existing heart valve disorders  and recent invasive procedures (like dental procedures) while making a clinical diagnosis. - Understand the potential complications of infective endocarditis and ways to identify them early. - Develop a comprehensive treatment plan including the choice of appropriate antibiotics and other supportive therapies.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,47,Case Report   Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 48-year-old African American male  residing in an urban setting. He is unemployed and lives alone. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use  particularly  heroin  which he has been using for the last 20 years.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C infection due to intravenous drug use  and hypertension for which he has been prescribed antihypertensive medication. He has an intermittent history of treatment for various infections  most recently a skin abscess three months prior. He has not completed full courses of prescribed antibiotics before. He does not have any known allergies to drugs or medications.  Key Complaints:  He has been feeling consistently unwell over the past two weeks  presenting with symptoms such as intermittent fever  fatigue  chills  and night sweats leading to substantial weight loss. He also reports a new onset of shortness of breath  along with a persistent cough. He is additionally complaining about severe joint and muscle aches  particularly in the lower extremities.  He has noticed that his symptoms notably deteriorate at night  causing him considerable distress. He attributes the onset of these symptoms to a “bad batch” of drugs but decided to seek medical help as the symptoms persist and have started interfering with his day-to-day activities.  Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and the symptomatology presented  suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) should be high  mandating an immediate diagnostic work-up. The blood cultures and echocardiography would be key to confirm this diagnosis.   Teaching Notes:  This case is significant due to the patient's socio-economic history and risky behaviors leading to a notorious predisposition to conditions such as IE. It showcases the critical need for empathetic patient interaction  a thorough understanding of risk factors  and a comprehensive and vigilant approach to non-specific signs and symptoms leading to early diagnosis of less common yet significant conditions. Furthermore  it prompts discussions on prevention strategies  importance of adherence to medication  especially to antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at high risk of IE.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,48,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use. He is a retired construction worker living in an urban environment. His family history reveals his mother died of breast cancer at 65  and his father passed away from heart failure at 73. He used to smoke  but quit about 15 years ago  and still maintains a moderate alcohol intake.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and recurrent cellulitis from injecting drugs. His only surgery was an appendectomy at the age of 25. He is not on any routine medications but takes over-the-counter pain killers when required. He has been hospitalized once before  two years ago  for cellulitis of his right forearm.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with a three-week history of nocturnal fevers  chills  night sweats  weakness  and a 10-pound unintended weight loss over the same period. He also reports new onset of dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort over the past week.   This fictive scenario depicts a patient in a high-risk group subject to infective endocarditis - samples such as this can be utilized for medical education purposes.  References: Baddour  L. M.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,49,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Patel Age: 63 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: South Asian Occupation: Retired engineer  Medical History: 1. Past history of IV drug use during the patient's college years  but has been clean for 30 years. 2. Non-compliant with his dental hygiene practices. 3. Personal history of smoking cigarettes for 20 years. 4. No known family history of heart diseases or stroke.  Key Complaints: 1. Persistent and unexplained fever for the past three weeks  which is not responding to over-the-counter medications. 2. Experiencing shortness of breath  especially with exertion. 3. Night sweats and chills without identifiable cause. 4. Recent incident of aching muscle pain and joint pain. 5. Noticed unexplained weight loss over the past month. 6. Fatigue and lethargy that is getting worse. 7. One episode of syncope last week  recovered spontaneously.  *This hypothetical training case aims to represent the typical demographics for native-valve infective endocarditis  as mentioned in the literature. According to studies  males are more likely to develop infective endocarditis  with the median age of diagnosis being 58 years old. Comorbid history of IV drug use and poor oral hygiene are some contributors to this condition. This case scenario should prompt students to further investigate symptoms indicative of infective endocarditis and aim to incorporate other important conditions into the differential diagnosis  such as pneumonia  tuberculosis  etc.  given the presenting symptoms.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,50,Patient Case:   Demographics: Mr. Tang  a 60-year-old Chinese male who works as a truck driver residing in a suburban environment.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Tang has a history of tobacco use (10-pack year history  quit 20 years ago)  moderate alcohol use  no illicit drug use  no history of intravenous drug use  and no known allergies. Past surgical history is significant for a hernia repair 10 years ago. He has hypertension that is controlled by hydrochlorothiazide. He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease  likely secondary to his long-standing hypertension. He has no known contacts with tuberculosis or hepatitides. Mr. Tang has never been vaccinated for pneumonia or influenza.  Primary Complaint:  Mr. Tang has reported experiencing malaise  fatigue  fever  chills  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past 3 months. Recently  he's started to notice blood in his urine and newly developed breathlessness  particularly with exertion.   Notice:  The chosen demographic simulates one of many people at risk for infective endocarditis. Hypertension  age  and reduced kidney function all contribute to his risk. Furthermore  his profession as a truck driver may also suggest poor access to regular hygiene and increases risk of infection. His ethnicity was specified to highlight that infective endocarditis can affect people of all backgrounds  and that the most significant risk factors are related to health history and habits  rather than ethnicity.   Note: This patient case is designed to introduce students to the typical presentation of native-valve infective endocarditis and encourages them to explore potential causes  symptoms  physical examination findings  relevant diagnostic/lab tests  treatment options  and preventative methods. It is important to address the specifics of the patient's lifestyle and habits (e.g.  nicotine and alcohol use) and ask about history suggestive of exposure to risk factors of endocarditis.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,51,Case Report  Patient's Profile: Name: Patient X (Maintaining confidentiality as per HIPAA rules) Gender: Male Age: 65 years Residence: Urban Neighborhood Occupation: Retired Mechanic  Presenting Complaints:  1. Fever and chills which has been on and off for the past three weeks. 2. Fatigue and unintentional weight loss. 3. New-onset  systolic murmur detected on routine check-up. 4. Several small and painless reddish spots seen on skin.  History of Presenting Illness:  Patient has been feeling ill for approximately the last three weeks and initially attributed this to a common cold. However  the fever did not abate and now is accompanied by night sweats and unexplained weight loss. There's a recently observed systolic heart murmur mentioned in his health records from last week's GP visit.   Past Medical and Social History:  He is a lifelong smoker but quit drinking alcohol 10 years ago. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he has been prescribed medication. He had a dental extraction performed 1 month prior. His father passed away from heart disease in his 70s. He does not have any allergies.  Physical Examination:  A new systolic murmur was detected on cardiac auscultation. Reddish spots (Janeway lesions) were noticed on his palms and soles. No Osler nodes were found on his fingers or toes. His oral examination showed no signs of any current infection.  Diagnosis:  With these symptoms and findings  the case suggests a scenario that fits the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  likely from the dental extraction a month ago. The patient's advanced age  smoking history  and male gender  make this a highly possible diagnosis as per the demographic prevalence found in literature. The Janeway lesions and new systolic murmur further support this diagnosis.   Lesson:  This case serves as a reminder for students to always consider the risk of endocarditis in their differential diagnosis when seeing patients with constant or recurrent fevers  especially those with a prior history of invasive dental or other procedures. This is even more important in patients with a history of heart conditions  as they have an increased risk for developing infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,52,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Demographics: 60-year-old Hispanic male  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Intravenous (IV) drug abuse but stopped around ten years ago. He's also known to be hypertensive and diabetic (Type II) under oral medication. Additionally  the patient is a heavy smoker with a pack/day habit for more than 30 years.  Presenting Complaints: The main complaints were intermittent fever for the past one month  associated with chills  night sweats and a weight loss of about 10 pounds during this period. Over the past week  he started experiencing dyspnea on exertion and occasional orthopnea which is unusual for him. He denied any recent history of IV drug use  dental procedures  or travel.  Note: Infective endocarditis is most common among men  aged between 30-60 years  especially among those with a history of IV drug use  even remote. Other important risk factors include underlying heart conditions  and poor oral hygiene. The choice of a Hispanic male in this case recognizes the need for more ethnic diverse case presentations in medical education. The manifestation of key symptoms like fever  malaise  and weight loss are typical of subacute bacterial endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,53,Case Summary:  Patient Demographics: 55-year-old Hispanic Male  non-smoking but has a history of intravenous drug use.  Past Medical History: History of Hepatitis C  varices  myalgia  previous Gram-negative sepsis  and recurrent urinary tract infections. He has been out of medical care for several years.  Key Complaints: Presents with a four-week history of malaise  fever  chills  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  intermittent chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath.   [Rationale: Infective Endocarditis often presents over several weeks with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise  fever  and weight loss. In our scenario  the patient's history of intravenous drug use and negligence of regular medical care serve as potential risk factors indicating possible infective endocarditis. Additionally  the choice of a Hispanic patient adheres to accurate demographic representation and highlights the disease's span across various ethnicities.]  This case design should be followed by key questions to help medical students identify important risk factors  associated symptoms  and potential complications for a patient presenting with infective endocarditis. It will also guide them through creating a differential diagnosis  selecting appropriate investigational tools and managing the condition.   References:  1. Selton-Suty C et al.  (2006).

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,54,Patient Demographics: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  retired  and currently residing in a suburban neighborhood. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  and does not have a history of drug use. He has no known allergies. He is overweight with a BMI of 28.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history. He suffered from a mild stroke 3 years ago and has also been managing atrial fibrillation (AF) for the last 5 years. The patient's AF is managed with regular anticoagulation therapy. Additionally  he has moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  managed with bronchodilators and occasional steroid therapy. The patient also has a history of dental infections having had two root canals in the last 10 years.  Key Complaints: The patient reports to the clinic with a two-week history of flu-like symptoms  the onset of which was gradual  and includes moderate to high-grade intermittent fevers  fatigue  and malaise. Recently  he has also been experiencing shortness of breath on slight exertion  unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and occasional chills. His family also noticed that his complexion seems slightly pallor. His primary care provider referred him to the hospital after noticing a new  low-grade murmur on his recent visit.  This case represents a demographic population prone to native-valve infective endocarditis: older adults with a history of previous heart problems. Endocarditis  in general  occurs more often in men than in women  with Caucasians more likely to be affected than other racial groups. While there are risk factors for endocarditis such as intravenous drug use  they won't be represented in this case so as to concentrate on the more common risk factors such as age  sex  previously damaged heart valves  and diseases causing a weakened immune system such as COPD. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,55,Case Report  Patient Demographics  Patient Jonathan K  is a 60-year-old African American male residing in the suburban area of Washington  D.C. He has been working as a construction engineer for the past 35 years.   Past Medical History  Jonathan had been previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus; controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. There is also a history of hypertension managed with ACE inhibitors. He has a 30-pack/year smoking history and binge drinks alcohol on weekends. No documented history of intravenous drug use. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease and hypertension.  Presenting Complaints  Jonathan visited his primary care provider after persistently running a low-grade fever for the past three weeks (100-101F)  with a sudden escalation to 103F in the last 48 hours. He describes the initial fever as unremarkable despite progressing to severe fatigue  unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and joint pain. After the recent high-grade fever episode  he experienced increasing shortness of breath at rest and chest discomfort resembling tightness.  Notes for Medical Educators  This case is structured to reflect characteristics found in literature for patients with native-valve infective endocarditis. The African American male representation is a departure from the historically Caucasian-centric representation  reflecting the increasing rates of this condition in African American populations in recent years. Risk factors such as intermediate age  occupation – suggesting potential exposure to infectious agents  and a history of diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and alcoholism have been integrated to enable teaching on the significance of comorbidities and health behaviors. Furthermore  a lack of intravenous drug use history keeps discussion focused on native-valve involvement. The case's unique set of symptoms ensure that trainees learn to suspect endocarditis even in patients who don't present classically.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,56,Case Report: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Patient  Patient Details: Name: Mr. X Age: 70 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History: 1. History of mild hypertension  for which he takes a daily low-dose of thiazide diuretic. 2. Past smoker  had quit smoking 15 years ago. 3. No history of diabetes  chronic kidney disease  or any other systemic disease. 4. No past surgeries or hospitalizations. 5. No known drug allergies. 6. Mild periodontal disease  poor oral hygiene.  Presenting Complaints: 1. Fever of 38.5 C present for the last two weeks. 2. Malaise and fatigue. 3. Weight loss of about 5 kgs in the past month. 4. Shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. 5. A new heart murmur noted.  Additional information: Mr. X lives alone and is fairly self-reliant. He reports difficulty in maintaining his dental hygiene due to poor manual dexterity. He has no known close contacts with infectious diseases and has not traveled recently.  Note: This patient represents a high-risk group (elderly  male  Caucasian) for native valve endocarditis  and has some common risk factors such as poor dental hygiene. Older age is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis with the median age for presentation being around 60 years. Males are reported to be more affected than females. Native valve endocarditis most commonly affects the mitral valve  followed by the aortic valve. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci are the most common pathogens. This case has multiple opportunities for students to learn about the importance of detailed history taking  physical exams  and a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management of endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,57,Patient Information: Mr. M  a 64-year-old retired African American male.  Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents  and a history of chronic untreated dental infections.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. M presents with a high-grade fever for the past week  accompanied by night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He reports that he has been feeling fatigued  with diminished appetite. He also mentions experiencing shortness of breath with moderate exertion. No recent travel  drug misuse  or recent surgeries. Not a smoker but history of mild alcohol use.  Medical Examination: On examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C)  blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg  pulse of 95 beats/min  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Upon inspection  there is noticeable conjunctival pallor. He has Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  and Osler's nodes seen on his fingers. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new pansystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. Dental examination reveals poor dental hygiene with multiple untreated carious teeth.  This case presents a common demographic victim of native-valve infective endocarditis as literature often connects this condition with males over 60  of African American descent  featuring pre-existing conditions of diabetes and poor oral health.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,58,"Case Report:  Demographics: Patient """"X"""" is a 67-year-old African American male from a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired mechanic living with his wife. He is also a long-term tobacco smoker with a history of alcohol intake but quit both five years back.   Past Medical History: Patient """"X"""" has a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both managed with oral medications for the past 15 years. The patient was also diagnosed with a mild form of chronic kidney disease 3 years ago. He has no known allergies  no previous surgeries  and his family history is notable for coronary artery disease in his father.  Key complaints: Patient """"X"""" presented at the emergency department complaining of a two-week history of general malaise  intermittent fever with night sweats  and an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past month. He reports recent onset of shortness of breath and occasional discomfort in his chest with exertion.   Accurate Demographic Representation as per Literature: This case reasonably represents a common demographic for native-valve infective endocarditis  which is most frequently seen in males over the age of 60. The patient’s African American ethnicity correlates with the disproportionate prevalence of hypertension  diabetes  and chronic kidney disease in this population  which also puts patient """"X"""" at an increased risk of endocarditis. The patient's past history of tobacco smoking and alcohol usage further increases his susceptibility to this condition. Irrespective of ethnicity  adults with underlying chronic conditions  such as the ones stated  comprise a significant proportion of the patient population. Patient """"X's"""" presentation aligns well with typical findings in infective endocarditis—fever  malaise  and weight loss  as well as the less common symptoms of night sweats and exertional chest discomfort.   This theoretical case representation helps medical students identify infective endocarditis's clinical symptoms  highlight risk factors  and understand the disease's demographics."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,59,Title: Case Study on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Mr. M  a 59-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department (ED).  Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history of illicit intravenous drug use (IVDU)  controlled Type II diabetes  and hypertension for which he is under medication. He does not have any history of cardiovascular disease  surgery  or dental procedures.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. M came to the ED with complaints of consistent  severe headache associated with high-grade fever for the past three weeks. Alongside this  he reported experiencing night sweats  loss of appetite leading to significant weight loss  and malaise. He also mentioned experiencing occasional shortness of breath  especially when lying flat  and a mild  intermittent dull aching chest pain.  Case Report: Research identifies men  specifically African American men between ages 50-70  as higher at risk for infective endocarditis  coupled with a history of IVDU and poor dental hygiene. Mr. M fits into these characteristic risk factors  making this case an illustrative model for the typical demographic affected by this disease.  This case can be used to train students to recognize the serious and subtle signs of native-valve infective endocarditis and understand the importance of obtaining detailed medical history in every patient to evaluate their risk factors.  [From here  educators can guide students through specific investigations such as blood cultures  echocardiogram  and treatment regimens like antibiotics  thus exploring the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of managing infective endocarditis.]
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,60,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. E  a 65-year-old Caucasian male of intermediate socioeconomic status  presents to the hospital. He lives in a rural area and has limited access to health care facilities.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has been managed outpatient with metformin 500mg twice daily  and losartan 50mg once daily. Despite his regular treatments  his control of both hypertension and diabetes is sub-optimal. He denies any history of intravenous drug use  alcohol abuse  or previous heart surgery. His family history reveals that his father had coronary artery disease and his younger sister suffers from type 1 diabetes.  Present Complaints:  Mr. E has been experiencing persistent low-grade fever and chills for the past two weeks. He also complains of generalized weakness  loss of appetite  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. He reports a recent decline in exercise tolerance due to episodes of shortness of breath and noticed that his ankles are swelling. Lastly  he states intermittent bouts of dizziness and heart palpitations.  The goal is to train students to arrive at a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  based on presenting complaints and risk factors belied by history. It's important to emphasize the role of diabetes in enabling infections due to its impact on immune function. Make students aware of common signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis while keeping in mind that this disorder can present differently in every patient.  Demographic data is representative regarding more common occurrence of native-valve infective endocarditis in aging male patients. This case takes into account the data on patients with preceding conditions like diabetes  hypertension  which are found more often in endocarditis patients  providing an accurate context for the training case.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,61,"Patient Information:  Name: """"Mr. Richard"""" Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Medical History: Mr. Richard has a history of mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he takes medication regularly. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. Fourteen months ago he was treated for a mild dental infection.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Richard presents to the emergency department with three weeks of intermittent fevers  night sweats  fatigue  and recent onset confusion. He has also noticed a decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss over the last month. His family members have noted that he has had been increasingly short of breath over the past week.  These complaints  along with his previous dental infection  could point towards a potential diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Being a Caucasian male above 60 years  with comorbid cardiovascular risks (hypertension and hyperlipidemia)  he fits within the typical demographic profile for infective endocarditis as per recent medical literature."
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,62,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  A 62-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History:  The patient has an established history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and heroin misuse.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  chills  excessive fatigue  weight loss  and occasional shortness of breath. The patient additionally mentions experiencing a constant dull backache and occasional night sweats.  Background Information: Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and its structures  commonly the heart valves. Previously  rheumatic heart disease was a common predisposing condition; however  in developed countries  its prevalence has decreased. Nowadays  patients with pre-existing structural heart disease and intravenous drug users are more likely to acquire this condition. It is slightly more prevalent among African-American  male  and patients aged 60 and above. The patient's demographic information and history of drug misuse make him susceptible to this condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,63,Case Report  Patient Demographics:  A 60-year-old African American male  works as a truck driver  overweight (BMI: 30)  smoker (15 cigarettes/day)  married  living in an urban neighborhood.  Past Medical History: This patient has a history of intravenous drug use during his early adulthood but has been clean for over 25 years. He has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years which is poorly controlled (HbA1C: 8.5) due to poor medication adherence. Moreover  he was also diagnosed with hypertension and stage 3 chronic kidney disease two years ago. He has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of a 4-week history of fatigue  low-grade fevers (usually above 100.4°F)  weight loss (approximately 10 pounds)  and night sweats. Over the past two weeks  he has noticed swelling in his legs and shortness of breath  particularly when climbing stairs. In the last 3 days  he has developed a new onset of a persistent and migratory joint pain that started in the knees and moved to the wrists. He has also noticed dark red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet which are painless.  The presenting complaints are in keeping with the classical triad of infective endocarditis; fever  heart murmur (due to valvular insufficiency) and peripheral phenomena ( e.g.  cutaneous findings such as Janeway lesions).  Note: The choice of a 60 year-old African American male patient  with the given comorbidities and socioeconomic background  provides an accurate representation as per literature on the most frequent demographic affected by infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,64,Patient Case:   Demographics:  Patient’s age: 65 years old  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Residence: Urban  Occupation: Retired   Medical History:  Diabetes Mellitus type 2  hypertension  moderate alcohol use  history of intravenous drug use  Presentation:  The patient presents to the emergency department with a two-month history of intermittent fever and chills  loss of weight and generalized fatigue. Over the past week  he has noticed shortness of breath on exertion. He also reports night sweats  decreased appetite and a rash on his legs which his wife noticed.  The choice of a 65-year-old male patient with a history of intravenous drug use takes into account epidemiological studies which suggest that infective endocarditis (IE) is increasing in incidence among older adults. Additionally  intravenous drug use is a recognized risk factor for IE  particularly among males.  In this case  the patient’s complaints align with the classical symptoms of native-valve infective endocarditis  including fever  the presence of a rash (potentially Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions) and symptoms related to cardiac decompensation (shortness of breath).  NB: IE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality  particularly without early diagnosis and treatment. Thus  this case is designed to highlight the importance of recognizing critical but often subtle signs of this condition. Further discussion of this case should focus on key investigations that can confirm IE (like blood cultures and echocardiography)  different etiologies (including different causative organisms) and appropriate management strategies  potentially including surgical intervention.   Recognizing the risk factors  presentation and management of IE is important for reducing complications associated with the infection. This case should enable students to focus on history taking  differential diagnoses  investigations  and management of infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,65,Patient Information:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 55 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Farmer  Past Medical History: - Recurrent Dental Infections - Regular Intravenous Drug Use - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - History of Heavy Alcohol Consumption  Presenting Complaints: - Reported 3-4 weeks of ongoing fatigue - New onset shortness of breath  particularly on exertion  - Fever  - Night sweats - Rapid weight loss - Muscular pain and joint pain  Physical Examination Findings - Low-grade fever  - Paleness  - Possible signs of peripheral embolization including Osler nodes (painful nodes on the fingers and toes) and Janeway lesions (red or purple spots on the palms or soles) - Murmurs detected on cardiac auscultation  This training case is fictional but is representative and intended for educational purposes. While infective endocarditis can occur at any age and in any demographic  this case uses a commonly represented patient: middle-aged  male  with significant risk factors including dental infections and intravenous drug use. Heavy alcohol use and diabetes are not unusual in this demographic  and they contribute to overall health vulnerability. Regular updates and consults with prevalent literature may be needed for the most accurate demographic representation.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,66,Patient Information: Mr. Miguel Rodriguez  60-year-old Hispanic male  born and raised in Texas  a retired construction worker living with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez was diagnosed with type II diabetes 5 years ago and has been managing it with diet and oral medication. He has a known history of illicit drug use (heroine)  which he quit 15 years ago but has ongoing impairment of the heart valve from that period. Although he quit  he has had numerous courses of treatment for skin abscesses due to complications from when he was using drugs. The patient is also hypertensive and occasionally experiences angina symptoms  but has no other systemic illnesses. Family history reveals a father deceased from myocardial infarction  and a mother with type II diabetes.  Presenting Complaints:  1. Mr. Rodriguez presents with a three-week history of intermittent fever  extreme fatigue and noticeable weight loss.  2. He also complains of heart palpitations and occasional chest pain. 3. His wife has noticed that his complexion has become pale and faintly bluish  especially around the mouth. 4. She also reports that he's been experiencing night sweats frequently. 5. He admits to the shortness of breath even during resting and especially with activities he could previously perform without trouble  such as climbing few stairs and household chores.  This case focuses on a common demographic who is at high risk for native valve endocarditis. A history of intravenous drug use  combined with the presence of type II diabetes and hypertension  increases Mr. Rodriguez's risk. It is  therefore  highly important for medical students to understand the role of these risk factors in the presentation and progression of infective endocarditis.   In the case report  the students need to identify the indicative symptoms of endocarditis such as intermittent fever and fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  shortness of breath  heart palpitations  chest pain and symptoms of heart failure  which may result from damage to the heart valves.  Taking this case forward  students should formulate a relevant plan  including further investigations and management in accordance with the current guidelines for endocarditis. The importance of considering valve replacement surgery for patients with severe and continuous symptoms  despite antibiotic therapy  should also be stressed.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,67,Patient Case Report: Native Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information:  A 48-year-old Caucasian male  Occupation: Works as a janitor in a local school  Past Medical History:  The patient is a known case of moderate-severity Rheumatic Heart Disease  diagnosed about six years ago  with a recurrent history of Strep throat infections during his childhood. He occasionally takes over-the-counter NSAIDs for joint pain that he attributes to his working conditions. He is a non-smoker and refrains from alcohol consumption. No known drug allergies or history of recreational drug use are reported.   Presenting Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of high-grade  intermittent fever for the past three weeks that is unresponsive to common antipyretics. He also reports experiencing night sweats and unintentional weight loss during the same period.   In addition  he mentions experiencing difficulty in breathing  especially on exertion  accompanied by palpitations. Upon further questioning  he also admits to noticing small  painless  red-blue spots (petechiae) on his palms and soles  not associated with itching or any other discomfort.  Review of Systems (ROS) discloses loss of appetite  light-headedness  and extreme fatigue. No other systemic complaints have been reported.  The patient's demographic representation with a common predisposing condition (Rheumatic Heart Disease)  occupations that expose to infection  and significant key complaints suggest the possibility of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. However  further evaluations  including physical examination and necessary diagnostic tests  should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the subsequent course of treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,68,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Alvarez  a 57-year-old Hispanic male.  Demographics:  Mr. Alvarez lives in Colorado  USA  and works as a long-haul truck driver.   Past Medical History: In terms of medical history  Mr. Alvarez is a known Type 2 Diabetic. He has been smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for the last 25 years but no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient also has a dental history of chronic periodontitis and has lost several teeth  opting for partial dentures. He had his last dental treatment 8 months ago.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Alvarez presented to the outpatient department with a fever of 102°F that started 3 weeks ago. He reports intermittent low-grade fever thereafter  and associated chills  malaise  and weight loss. He also mentions being more short of breath than usual in the past month  experienced fatigue  and palpitations. He reports seeing some reddish spots on his skin. He also reveals noticing a vaguely described discomfort in his upper abdomen and complains of loss of appetite.  The case focuses on these symptoms  which are indicative of infective endocarditis in context with his background of poor dental hygiene and diabetes  predisposing Mr. Alvarez to a higher risk. It is important to remind medical students of the connection between oral health and conditions such as infective endocarditis. Remembering that presentation may differ widely  symptoms such as persistent fever unresponsive to regular antibiotics  embolic phenomenon  and immunological phenomena should lead students to consider endocarditis in their differential diagnosis.   Case reports like these are essential tools for teaching and reinforcing the understanding of disease presentation  clinical reasoning  and management strategies.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,69,Case Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient History:   Mr. Jeff Bowman is a 62-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with complaints consistent with a three-week history of low-grade fever  loss of appetite  weight loss of 5% over the last month  fatigue  and a new heart murmur.  Mr. Bowman is a retired chemical engineer from Birmingham  Alabama. He is a former smoker  quitting some 15 years earlier. He has a past medical history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril 10 mg  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily. There is no known history of intravenous drug use  recent dental procedures  or any invasive procedure. He does not have any known allergies and is up-to-date with his vaccinations.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Bowman has been feeling unwell for the past three weeks. He has mentioned intermittent low-grade fever  unexplained fatigue  a loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss. His wife also noticed that his breathing has been faster than usual  especially at night. Recently  he has been complaining of discomfort in his chest. In the last few days  the discomfort has turned into chest pain that does not radiate and is more noticeable when he is lying down.   Physical Examination:   On physical examination  his vital signs are: blood pressure 135/85 mmHg  heart rate 98 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  temperature 100.2°F (37.9°C)  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. His BMI is 29. He appears chronically ill. The cardiac exam reveals a new early diastolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border  and some peripheral stigmata of endocarditis are present. He looks pale and in visible pain due to the chest discomfort.   This case of endocarditis has been developed considering the epidemiologic data. Native valve infective endocarditis mainly occurs in men (male to female ratio approximately 2:1)  people more than 60 years old  and those with prior cardiac conditions. African-Americans have a slightly higher risk for endocarditis  particularly men aged over 60. The gradual onset of symptoms  like fever and weight loss  and examination findings  like a new murmur and signs of vasculitis  align with the insidious nature of this disease. The case focuses on native-valve infective endocarditis as this is more common and presents a characteristic clinical scenario that would assist in teaching undergraduates.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,70,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Garcia Age: 60 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Janitor  Past Medical History: Mr. Garcia has a history of intravenous drug use  an important risk factor for native-valve infective endocarditis. He is in recovery and has been sober for the last ten years with no history of relapse. He is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The patient had an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 4 years back  treated with antibiotics not leading to any significant complications. He was not on any sanitary prophylaxis and has no known allergies. He has a history of smoking but quit 2 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Over the last three weeks  Mr. Garcia presented with intermittent fever with chills  night sweats  and an unintended weight loss of nearly 6kgs. Recently  he noticed petechial rashes on his torso and legs. He has also been experiencing shortness of breath on exertion which was previously not there. A mild and continuous headache has been concerning him over a week.  Note: This case presents a patient in the key demographic for native-valve infective endocarditis. Risk factors include his history of drug use  age  male sex  and pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension. The case also highlights classical systemic  pulmonary  and neurological symptoms along with characteristic skin signs.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,71,Case Report:  Patient Information:  Mr. Thomas is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  working as a construction supervisor  living in a suburban setting. He is not a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thomas has a past medical history of rheumatic fever in his early teens  with no recurrences. He has mild hypertension  managed with lifestyle modifications and is diet-controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus. He has no family history of cardiovascular disease. He does not partake in any recreational drug use.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient has presented with a 3-week history of malaise  intermittent fever  loss of appetite  and unexplained weight loss. More recently  he has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion and a new onset of a heart murmur that is not previously documented in his medical records.  Given the patient's previous history of rheumatic fever with no evidence of current pharyngeal infection  and new findings such as unexplained fevers  malaise  weight loss  this situation raises a high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis. Furthermore  signs like new-onset heart murmur and dyspnea on exertion represent possible valvular involvement signifying a native-valve infective endocarditis. Antibiotic misuse or poor antibiotic adherence could be a potential risk factor  which needs to be explored.   This case will provide the students an opportunity to discuss history taking  examination findings  differential diagnosis  investigations  complications  and management regarding native-valve infective endocarditis.   Patients like Mr. Thomas are appropriate for a case on native-valve infective endocarditis considering the fact that men  especially those over 50  and Caucasians are at a heightened risk for this condition. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,72,Patient Case:  Mr. Alfredo Cruz  a 56-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the emergency department accompanied by his wife  who reports that he has been lethargic and had worsening shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He has also been experiencing unexplained weight loss and night sweats. Mr. Cruz works as a laborer and primarily speaks Spanish.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Cruz is known to have a history of intravenous drug use (heroin) in his 30s. There is a past history of Hepatitis C infection  for which he received treatment with the completion of therapy 6 years ago. He denies any medical intervention since then. He does not have any known heart disease  diabetes  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia.   Family History:  His family history is significant for his father who passed away because of congestive heart failure at the age of 65.  Key Complaints:  1. Lethargy  2. Shortness of breath 3. Unexplained weight loss 4. Night sweats  This case for medical students weaves in facts about native valve infective endocarditis  such as the association with IV drug use history in Hispanic males disproportionately affected. The key complaints listed may indicate endocarditis  bearing further investigation. The case allows students to explore the diagnosis pathway via physical exam  blood cultures  echocardiography and ultimately the management of such patient.  Teaching note: Native valve infective endocarditis often affects patients with regular heart valves but with predisposing conditions like IV drug use. The diagnosis can be complex due to the wide variety of clinical presentations. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for improving the outcome. This clinical scenario will help students understand the significance of comprehensive history taking  thorough physical examination  and corralling these findings into a relevant differential diagnosis  leading to appropriate diagnostic tests and management. This case encourages discussions on health disparities and cultural sensitivities in healthcare.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,73,Case Report - Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE)  Demographics: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male retiree  presented himself at the emergency department. He resides in an urban environment with his wife  is a former construction worker  and is a non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a documented history of Type-II Diabetes Mellitus  under good control with diet and metformin. He also has been treated for hypertension for the past ten years. Mr. Rodriguez underwent a dental extraction 2 months back. He has no prior history of illicit drug use  congestive heart failure  or valvular heart disease. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease.  Chief Complaint (CC): Over the past 3 weeks  Mr. Rodriguez has been experiencing persistent fatigue  intermittent fever with night sweats  and unintended weight loss. He also mentioned a new onset of lower back pain for the past one week.  Please note: This case has been designed to reflect common demographic representation for native-valve infective endocarditis  given that this condition frequently impacts elderly males with some form of pre-existing heart condition or exposure to conditions that could potentially lead to bacteremia  such as dental procedures. Additionally  the prevalence of NVE in the Hispanic population is significant.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,74,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: John is a 43-year-old Caucasian male  a known intravenous drug user without consistent access to healthcare.  Past Medical History: John carries a diagnosis of chronic Hepatitis C from his drug abuse. He has experienced recurrent skin abscesses  but has no known allergies. John has never been hospitalized. He has intermittent access to substance abuse counseling and management for Hepatitis C but frequently misses appointments.  Chief Complaint:  Recently  John began experiencing constant fatigue  intermittent fever  chills  night sweats  and an unintentional weight loss. He reports worsening shortness of breath and tiring easily after minor activity.  Clinical Relevance: Intravenous drug use is a risk factor for infective endocarditis due to repeated introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream. Furthermore  these individuals often present with delayed or missed diagnoses due to inconsistent access to healthcare and the nonspecific symptoms of infective endocarditis. This scenario offers an opportunity to teach medical students about the epidemiology and varying presentations of infective endocarditis  and the need for a high degree of clinical suspicion in at-risk populations. It further underscores the notion of patient-centered care and the association between social determinants of health and patient outcomes.   Note: This case is representative of native-valve infective endocarditis  which is more common in intravenous drug users and may include symptoms such as fever  chills  fatigue  and weight loss. The patient's chronic Hepatitis C is representative of comorbid conditions that pose an additional risk toward endocarditis. The demographic used in this case accounts for the over-representation of Caucasian males among intravenous drug users  as identified in several research studies. The development of the case presents an opportunity to discuss the clinical presentation  management and complications of native valve infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,75,Patient Information:   Patient is a 63-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity. He works in the construction industry and lives in urban conditions with his wife and two children.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a known history of bi-valvular heart disease with moderate stenosis in both mitral and aortic valves. He was diagnosed 5 years ago. He takes medication for hypertension and is in Phase II of congestive heart failure. He is a former smoker  having quit about 10 years ago  due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is not an IV drug user. He has no known allergies to medications.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient has come in complaining of fever associated with a cough and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. The fever is accompanied by night sweats and intermittent chills. His chronic cough has also worsened  with increased sputum production. The patient's family reports he seems more fatigued than usual and has experienced an unexplained weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past month. His wife also mentioned an change in his mental status recently  involving occasional periods of confusion. He has also reported some joint pain  and yesterday began to notice some small red spots on the palms of his hands.   Explanation:  The demographic information and presentation align with the literature's depiction of the usual population affected by native-valve infective endocarditis. It is often associated with underlying valvular heart disease and men have a higher incidence than women. Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations have a similar incidence of infective endocarditis. Symptoms such as prolonged fever  cough  and weight loss  coupled with the patient's known history of valvular heart disease  should prompt concern for endocarditis as a differential diagnosis. The presence of Janeway lesions (small red spots on palms)  worsening of COPD symptoms  confusion  and fever are indicative of possible septic emboli.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,76,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Demographics:  Patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  locally born and raised. He is a retired construction worker who resides with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  with a 40 pack-year history  and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He denies any drug misuse.  Past Medical History:  Patient has a known history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is on Metformin. He was diagnosed with moderate aortic stenosis 5 years ago  but he declined surgical intervention. He had an admission for pneumonia 1 year ago. His latest echocardiogram report (6 months ago) showed moderate aortic stenosis remained stable.   Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of fatigue  generalized weakness  and fevers up to 39.5°C. He reports intermittent  mild  dull  and non-radiating chest pain for the last week  without exertional symptoms. Further  he mentions unintentional weight loss (~5 Kg) within the past 2 months. His wife has also noticed that he is more confused recently.  This hypothetical case represents an older patient with known valvular disease and other comorbidities (as frequently seen in cases of infective endocarditis). His symptoms are consistent with potential infective endocarditis – fevers  malaise  chest discomfort  and possible new cognitive changes indicating potential septic emboli. This example takes into account the average demographic of these patients as per relevant literature - individuals who are older  male  and have pre-existing valvular disease or other risk factors relating to an infection.   The case encourages medical students to consider a holistic approach to patient's symptoms  correlates these to pathophysiology of potential diseases  and accentuates the significance of integrated care  right from the emergency department to tertiary cardio-care  for the management of complex conditions like infective endiocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,77,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 35-year-old Caucasian male  working as a construction worker  presenting to the emergency department. He is in a steady relationship  has two preschool-aged children  and is a non-smoker. He also has a history of sporadic intravenous drug use  in remission from his heavy use in his teens and early twenties.   Past Medical History: His prior health history significantly includes hepatitis C and a previous dental abscess that required extraction two years ago. There are no known allergies; however  the risks associated with drug use and poor dental hygiene are noted.  Key Complaints: For the past few weeks  the patient has been feeling generally unwell with intermittent fevers  significant weight loss  and a new-onset shortness of breath. He had presumed this was due to overworking and stress  but the symptoms progressively worsened. He also noticed an unusual lump in his left armpit. On the day of reporting  he experienced excruciating chest pain and hence  presented to the ER.  The character  severity  duration  variation  and radiation of the chest pain and associated symptoms should be explored. The construction industry has a well-documented high incidence of drug misuse  leading to potential infections from unsanitized needles. This patient's background allows the consideration of native-valve infective endocarditis  which has been empirically correlated with intravenous drug use. Additionally  dental procedures are known to release bacteria in the bloodstream  which could potentially reach the heart leading to infective endocarditis.  This realistic case blend ensures ample representation of significant stressors and demographic factors associated with this clinical pathology. The late presentation of the condition also mirrors real-world doctor-patient scenarios where non-medical factors may delay patient's care. Consequently  this highlights the importance of holistic patient management and considering patients' diverse backgrounds when crafting differential diagnoses  particularly when symptoms are inconsistent or non-specific.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,78,Patient Report:  Patient Information:  A 52-year-old white male patient  known as Mr. Woods  working as a construction worker.  Past Medical History: Mr. Woods has a significant history of intravenous drug use  with sporadic periods of abstinence. He has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C five years prior due to his high-risk behavior and has been monitored ever since without the need for antiviral treatment. He has a past instance of a right leg abscess from needle use  though no previous history of endocarditis or other heart disease. He has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Woods presents with a two-week history of increasing fatigue  malaise  and excessive night sweats. Over the past few days  he also reports experiencing shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. He mentions intermittent fevers at home. He has noticed occasional 'spots' on his skin  which are reddish-purple and have a slightly raised appearance. He denied any discomfort in the chest  pallor  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or lower leg edema. He has not experienced any changes in weight  appetite  or bowel habits.   The chosen demographics reflect literature data  indicating Caucasian males  especially those with a history of intravenous drug use  are commonly affected by native-valve infective endocarditis (Lalani et al.  2018). The primary symptoms  including fatigue  malaise  night sweats  intermittent fever  dyspnea on exertion  and skin spots  are typical presentations of this disease (Sladden et al.  2019). Furthermore  the simultaneous presence of Hepatitis C provides an interesting background of co-morbidity  common in patients with high-risk behaviors  such as IV drug use. The lack of resistance to antibiotics adds another layer of complexity to the case that can fairly challenge medical students to think critically.   References: Lalani  T.  Chu  V. H.  Park  L. P.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,79,Patient Information:  Patient's Name: Patient X (to maintain confidentiality) Gender: Male Age: 45 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Factory Worker Living environment: Urban  Past Medical History:  Patient X has a documented history of intravenous drug use spanning over two decades and sporadic / inadequate treatment for this addiction. Patient also has a history of smoking and untreated Hepatitis C infection.  Chief Complaint:  Patient X presents with a 2-week history of severe and worsening malaise  intermittent fevers  chills and night sweats. He has also experienced weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms over the last month  which was unintentional. Patient denies any trauma  recent travel  or known sick contacts. He has no history of heart disease or any other chronic illnesses apart from Hepatitis C.  The scenario assumes a relatively common demographic for native-valve infective endocarditis; an adult male with a history of intravenous drug use. Infective endocarditis is indeed often associated with these factors in the developed world  and it is quite important to educate medical students about the diverse social determinants of health  and to challenge any potential biases they may have.   In this case  although Hepatitis C does not directly result in endocarditis  it helps paint a realistic picture of a patient with multiple ongoing health and social issues  and encourages a holistic approach to healthcare provision. Additionally  emphasis should be placed on the patient's occupational setting as a factory worker  as this socio-economic context could potentially impact the availability and access to healthcare services.   Moreover  the symptoms described are classic for endocarditis  and should lead practitioners to look out for potential signs on examination such as Osler's nodes  Janeway Lesions  and Roth spots in the eyes. It would also prompt important follow-up investigations such as blood cultures  echocardiogram and potentially treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,80,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information:   Mr. Jones  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  which is managed through diet and oral hypoglycemic medication  and mild hypertension controlled through lifestyle interventions. No previous surgeries have been reported. He is a former smoker  having quit around 10 years ago  and denies any history of illicit drug use.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presents with a three-week history of intermittent fever  excessive fatigue  and weight loss. He also reports experiencing diaphoresis (excessive sweating) during sleep. Furthermore  he complains of a new  mild heart murmur that he felt over the last week. His wife  who accompanied him  expressed concern over his recent onset of nocturnal delirium  which never occurred in the past.  These symptoms have prompted the need for further investigation to rule out the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis. As infective endocarditis incidence is higher in males and typically presents in their sixth decade  Mr. Jones' demographics and symptoms are consistent with a real-world case example.  NB: The design of this case was focused on representing a typical patient who might develop native-valve infective endocarditis  according to literature. Variations may certainly occur in real-world clinical situations depending on multifarious factors such as patient's unique medical history  environmental exposure  and genetic background.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,81,Patient Information: The patient is a 56-year-old Irish male named Mr. Murphy who works on a dairy farm.   Past Medical History: Mr. Murphy has a history of rheumatic heart disease from childhood for which he has been on long-term antibiotics prophylaxis. He also has moderate hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril  and is a smoker with about a 20-pack year history. He is not a drinker and does not use any illicit drugs. He has not undergone any recent dental procedures. His family history includes cardiac disease and diabetes.   Presenting Complaints: For the past 2 weeks  Mr. Murphy has been experiencing intermittent fevers that usually occur at night. He has also been feeling generally unwell and fatigued  which he initially attributed to overwork. In the last few days  he's noticed that his breathlessness has significantly increased  especially while tending to his farm. He has lost his appetite and has lost about 2 kilograms of weight in the past two weeks. He has noticed small red spots on his skin. He denies any chest pain  palpitations  cough  or changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Relevance: According to literature  patients with a history of rheumatic heart disease and chronic antibiotic use  and who are involved in animal farming  are at a high risk of developing native valve infective endocarditis. In Europe  infective endocarditis is most commonly seen in males  and its incidence increases with age  especially in patients who have underlying heart diseases like rheumatic heart disease. Given this  it’s important for medical students to fully understand this demographic patient representation in order to manage and treat accordingly. The above-narrated case thus very well integrates such a real-life scenario.   Students must be trained to approach the diagnosis and management of endocarditis in patients with past rheumatic heart disease  considering that their pre-existing valvular damage increases their susceptibility to infections. Symptoms like fevers  fatigue  weight loss  breathlessness  little red spots on the skin (petechiae) and being generally unwell are some of the key signs that should raise clinician suspicion for infective endocarditis in such patients. Timely recognition and initiation of appropriate management are crucial as infective endocarditis can rapidly progress to a critical condition if left untreated.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,82,Patient Profile: Age: 55 years Gender: Male Race: African American  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. X has visited the emergency department with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  accompanied by chills and night sweats. He is also experiencing weight loss  fatigue and intermittent shortness of breath on exertion. He has noticed some small  painless  red spots on his palms and soles.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has had a history of Intravenous (IV) drug use in the past  but he claims to have been clean for the past five years. His past medical history also includes Hepatitis C and intermittent periods of homelessness. He is a smoker and has a pack-a-day habit for the past 30 years.  Clinical consideration: Given his history of IV drug use and his current symptoms  one of the considerations would be infective endocarditis. His age  ethnicity and male gender  all are key demographic factors. African-Americans and men have been demonstrated to have higher prevalence  with increasing incidence noted in the fifth and sixth decade of life. IV drug use remains one of the major risk factors.  This short report provides a broad starting point for more detailed case development with a targeted depicter of native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in connection with elevated risk due to the past IV drug use. The case challenges the learners to consider societal and lifestyle factors  time to recovery from previous substance issues  systemic symptoms and common complications of this important condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,83,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. R.B  a 60-year-old Caucasian male smoker from a rural setting who works as a farmer.  Past Medical History: The patient has a previous medical history of rheumatic heart disease from his adolescent years. He never adhered to a regular follow-up routine due to non-availability of medical facilities in his vicinity.  Clinical Presentation: The patient has been feeling generally unwell for the past few weeks. His primary complaints include an unrelenting fever for 3 weeks  a 10 lbs weight loss over a period of 1 month  fatigue  night sweats  and a decrease in appetite. Recently  he developed dyspnea on exertion and has noticed his shoes have become tight due to ankle swelling. He has no prior history of illicit IV drug use.  Physical exam: Physical exam findings include pallor  poor dentition  a heart murmur best heard at the cardiac apex  signs of congestive heart failure  and small hemorrhages under his fingernails.  These basics can set up a case study to discuss native-valve infective endocarditis  specifically focusing on causative agents (probably Streptococcus viridans due to poor dentition)  related diagnostic procedures (including blood cultures  echocardiograms  Duke’s criteria)  potential complications  and therapeutic approaches.   This case profile represents a common demographic for the incidence of this condition. Often it occurs among elderly patients who have a history of valvular heart disease. Non-compliance with medical follow-up due to difficulty accessing care is a more common problem among rural populations  increasing the risk of not identifying health problems in a timely manner. Although rheumatic heart disease is less common in developed countries  it remains problematic in certain high-risk groups  making this case relevant.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,84,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 63-year-old African American male.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) which ended five years ago  Diabetes mellitus type 2 managed with metformin  and is frequently admitted to the hospital for recurrent pneumonia.   Chief Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department with a one-week history of intermittent fever of unknown origin  chills  and malaise. More acute symptoms developed over the last two days  including confusion  night sweats  shortness of breath  and a new-onset rash resulting in scar-like erosions on his hands and feet.   Background:  In the context of the past medical history and high-risk behavior  the symptoms presented by the subject in our case simulate a possible case of infective endocarditis (IE). Native-valve IE is more common among older adults  men  and is often complicated by drug abuse  poor dental hygiene  and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. African Americans  partly due to disparities in healthcare  exhibit higher rates of IE. Hence  the demographic representation in this case scenario is based on accurate epidemiologic data.  This brief case introduces students to the clauses of infectious diseases  namely infective endocarditis. The goal of this training is to help them understand the risk factors  clinical presentation  and underlying pathophysiology of IE  with an emphasis on the importance of comprehensive communication and clinical expertise in patient care.   Note: This case report is open-ended  providing room for students to deduce the relevant investigations necessary  possible findings  management  and prevention methods. Through understanding this case  students should be able to recognize infective endocarditis  understand its pathophysiology  and propose appropriate management strategies. 
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,85,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 60 years Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Unemployed Location: Urban area  Chief Complaints: 1. Recurrent intermittent fever for last two weeks. 2. Fatigue and overall weakness. 3. 2-3 episodes of nocturnal shortness of breath. 4. Noticed reddish spots in skin - mainly on his hands and feet.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use in his 40s  but no recent history of drug use. He was diagnosed with Hepatitis C 15 years ago and received treatment. However  a recent health check showed elevated liver enzymes indicating possible chronic liver disease. He also has been diagnosed with hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes medication regularly.  Family History: Father died of heart attack at the age of 70. Mother is hypertensive and diabetic.  Physical Examination: On examination  patient has a fever of 101°F. He appears pale. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new regurgitant murmur. Skin examination shows scattered petechiae predominately in his extremities and the presence of Osler's nodes on his hands and feet.   Smoking/Alcohol history: Patient is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally.  Summary: This case represents a 60-year-old male with a past history of intravenous drug use  Hepatitis C  hypertension  and type-II diabetes  now presenting with indicative signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis. The combination of fever  cardiac murmur  petechiae  and Osler's nodes in conjunction with the patient's medical past is strongly suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. This case would necessitate critical thinking from medical students about how to approach diagnosis and management considering comorbid conditions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,86,Case Scenario: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: Gender: Male Age: 60 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired manual laborer Address: Lives in a suburban community Smoking Status: Current smoker Alcohol Consumption: Light drinker Illicit Drug Use: None  Past Medical History:  1) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - under treatment with Metformin 2) Rheumatic Fever in his teens 3) Surgery for appendicitis 20 years ago 4) Multiple dental procedures in the past year  Key complaints: The patient presents with a 3-week history of a persistent  low-grade fever  sweating  and generalized body weakness. He also mentioned unintentional weight loss and reduced appetite. He stated that he has been feeling fatigued  which has ultimately led to a decrease in physical activity. He complains of occasional night sweats and a newfound disdain for cold weather as he feels it more intensely. In the recent week  he has also noticed a change in urine color  turning dark yellow.  All these symptoms have led him to seek medical attention. Despite no history of illicit drug use or recent invasive procedures  his history of recent multiple dental procedures  rheumatic fever in his past medical history  the presence of a chronic disease (Diabetes mellitus)  and his current complaints warrants a strong suspicion towards infective endocarditis on native valves.  The course of the case will then be designed to make medical students consider  diagnose  and manage patients with potential native-valve infective endocarditis. Key learning objectives will encompass understanding the epidemiology of this infection  interpreting present clinical signs and symptoms alongside appropriate diagnostic approach  and formulating an efficient treatment plan based on the infecting pathogen and individual health factors.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,87,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information:  Mr. J. Martinez  a 63-year-old Hispanic male with a moderate-level socioeconomic status  presented to the emergency department of a large urban hospital.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Martinez has a past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease stage III. He also has a 35-year history of smoking but quit eight years ago. There is no prior history of illicit drug use. His father had an early myocardial infarction  and his mother suffers from hypertension.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Martinez reported experiencing a high-grade intermittent fever associated with chills for the past two weeks  which was not alleviated by over-the-counter medications. The fever was occasionally accompanied by night sweats. Mr. Martinez also mentioned a loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss during this period. For the past two days  he had been feeling general weakness and shortness of breath upon minimal exertion. He did not report any chest pain  cough  hemoptysis  or orthopnea.   Reason for Inclusion:  Given the demographic representation and the patient's clinical presentation  this case provides clinical relevance for the teaching and understanding of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). According to literature  IE occurs most frequently among males  with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1  and peaks in older patients who have pre-existing cardiac conditions. It is seen in ethnic minorities disproportionately due to barriers in accessing healthcare. Complications may arise in patients with coexisting diabetes mellitus and renal dysfunction. The persistence of symptoms despite symptomatic management  paired with the patient's medical history  raises the suspicion of a systemic infection like IE. The case  thus  emphasizes the importance of considering IE in differential diagnoses when treating elderly patients who present with persistent fevers and have previously known comorbid conditions.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,88,Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint: The patient has been experiencing persistent fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss over the course of a few weeks. Recently  he has developed mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use in his late 20s to early 30s  but has been clean for almost three decades. Documented medical history includes hypertension  for which he takes medication  and he quit smoking 10 years ago. He does not have a history of heart disease  diabetes  or significant infections. He has no known allergies.  Family History: His father died of a sudden myocardial infarction in his 70s  and his mother is living and healthy in her late 80s. His younger sister is a breast cancer survivor. No history of heart disease is known in the immediate family members.  Present Illness: The patient has noticed a decline in his general health over the past few weeks. He has a fever that has not subsided and has also lost a considerable amount of weight without intending to do so. These symptoms have led to extreme fatigue. His symptoms have escalated recently with the onset of shortness of breath  especially upon exertion.  Summary: The case is an ideal representation of an elderly patient with a past history of drug use who presents with symptoms of infective endocarditis. The symptoms are nonspecific  except for the persistent fever  which is often a common clinical presentation of infective endocarditis. The patient's condition will provide an excellent learning opportunity for students to grasp the intricate disease process  its relationship with the patient's past drug history  the insidious and polymorphic nature of infective endocarditis  as well as the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,89,Case Report:   Patient Information: Ms. C  a 52-year-old African-American female with a notable smoking habit.  Past Medical History: Hypertension and hyperlipidemia. No past surgical or relevant family history. Non-compliant with her prescribed hypertensive and lipid-lowering medication regimen.  Presenting Complaints: Presenting with a 2-week history of periodic fevers  chills  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds. She has been feeling generally unwell  and also complains of night sweats and new onset of shortness of breath on exertion along with occasional palpitations.  Notably  she has not had recent dental work or procedures. She does not use illicit drugs. She has never been diagnosed with any heart conditions in the past.  Relevant Information: According to an overview by Selton-Suty et al.  2012  infective endocarditis most often presents in patients with predisposing cardiac conditions or those who engage in intravenous drug use. However  it is also seen in patients without these risk factors. Additionally  the presentation of infective endocarditis can be variable  but often includes nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue  weight loss  fevers  night sweats  and sometimes heart murmurs or embolic phenomena.  Reminder: Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for possible cases of infective endocarditis  especially among patients presenting with atypical symptoms and no identifiable risk factors.  This case could be used to highlight the importance of maintaining a broad differential  considering the possible diagnosis in many forms of presentation  and recognizing the life-threatening potential of this condition if left untreated.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,90,Patient Information:   Mr. Giovanni Ortiz  50-year-old Latino male  employed as a construction worker  residing in urban settlement.   Past Medical History:   Patient has a 10-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  both well-controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. He admits to being a previous intravenous drug user but has been clean for 15 years. Has no prior surgical history and no known drug allergies.  Chief Complaints:  The patient has presented with a two-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  weight loss; a recent onset of discomfort in the chest  and dyspnea on exertion. He also complains of night sweats and a loss of appetite that has progressively worsened.  Note:  This case is designed to focus on native-valve infective endocarditis. It's important to note that Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a rare condition but can be lethal if not diagnosed or treated properly. It can occur in any age group but is more common in males than females. Risk factors include prior heart valve disease  intravenous drug use  poor oral hygiene  central venous catheters. The disease often presents non-specifically and involves multiple systems  requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion for diagnosis.   This case is built with a patient demographic typical and representative of the patients that the students are likely to encounter in clinical practice. The patient's history of heart disease makes him a high-risk candidate for Infective Endocarditis (IE). The chosen symptoms are indicative of typical IE presentation as per research  with the intention of guiding the learner to consider IE among differential diagnoses.   This case would prompt considerations such as:   1. The importance of thorough history taking  particularly regarding past medical history that may predispose the patient to endocarditis. 2. Prompt recognition of IE symptoms leading to timely diagnosis and management. 3. The appreciation of complex decision-making in the treatment of patients with IE. 4. The understanding of consequences of delayed or incorrect treatment.   This case  therefore  represents a real-world scenario for students to develop their clinical and decision-making skills. It provides a concrete starting point for discussion and evaluation of a common but challenging clinical problem.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,91,Case Study: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: A 63-year-old African-American male  presenting to the emergency department (ED).  Past Medical History: Patient has a known history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He has been on oral hypoglycemics and anti-hypertensive medicines for past five years.  Chief Complaints: He came to the ED with the chief complaints of:  1) High-grade fever with chills for past 10 days.  2) Shortness of breath  getting progressively worse during the same period.  3) Mild  intermittent chest pain for past week.  Given the prominent prevalence of infective endocarditis among males aged 60 and above (according to literature)  along with their heightened risk due to comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes  this case paints an accurate picture for a medical student learning about real world presentations of native-valve infective endocarditis. Utilizing this case  medical students can be taught to diagnose the disease based on symptoms  risk factors and later on  clinical tests and examination. Informing them about the greater prevalence among African American and male demographics further roots their understanding in real-world data and prepares them for practical scenarios.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,92,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Details: Name: Mr. Torres Age: 53 years old Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Factory worker  Past Medical History:  Mr. Torres is a previous smoker  having quit 8 years ago. He has a known history of moderate rheumatic heart disease from childhood  with no surgical interventions. The patient has been managing type II diabetes mellitus for the last 5 years  largely through a combination of Metformin and lifestyle modifications. There is no known history of illicit drug use.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Torres presents to the clinic with a three-week history of generalized weakness  recent anorexia and unintended weight loss  and fevers with night sweats. He also mentions a new heart murmur noted by his primary care physician  associated with occasional shortness of breath on exertion  which is unusual for him. Mr. Torres also noticed petechiae on his lower limbs over the past week.   Significant findings:  On examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius. He shows Osler’s nodes in his hands and Janeway lesions are spotted on his palms and soles. Cardiac exam reveals a new-onset grade III/VI diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.   Diagnosis:  Mr. Torres's presentation  along with his history  strongly suggest a case of infective endocarditis on a native valve  likely a sequela of his rheumatic heart disease. His condition could be complicated due to his immunocompromised status as a result of diabetes mellitus.   Note: This case illustrates infective endocarditis in an adult male patient with multiple risk factors like rheumatic heart disease and diabetes. The patient belongs to an underrepresented Hispanic community and has a history of smoking. The combination of generalized systemic and specific clinical features contributes to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis here. This case can be used to train medical students about early recognition and management of infective endocarditis. Instruction on the crucial role of dental hygiene  as well as consultation with dentistry  could be included as part of preventative measures  especially in those with pre-existing valvular disease.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,93,Case Report  Patient Demographics:   Mr. Reynolds is a 60-year-old African American male  a retired construction worker  who hails from the urban area of Detroit  Michigan. He lives alone and is a widower with two adult children who stay separately.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Reynolds has a past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both diagnosed 5 years ago and is on a regimen of Metformin and Lisinopril. He quit smoking 2 years ago but admits to occasional alcohol consumption. He also reports a history of an untreated dental abscess 1 month ago.  Presenting Complaints:  He presents to the emergency department with a complaint of fever  fatigue  and shortness of breath for the past three weeks  which he initially presumed to be flu symptoms. Mr. Reynolds also reports an intermittent  low intensity  non-radiating chest pain for the past week. He denies any history of intravenous drug use.  Rationale for the demographics:  According to literature  infective endocarditis commonly affects males over age 50 with prevalence rates highest among African Americans  typically those with a history of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension (JAMA Cardiology  2017). It is also associated with poor dental health due to a higher chance of Streptococcus viridans  one of the most common pathogens causing native-valve endocarditis  entering the bloodstream and colonizing the heart valves (Medscape  2019). Choosing Detroit as a location for this case takes into account the contribution of socioeconomic factors to health outcomes  given it is one of the poorest major cities in the United States with a large African American population.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,94,Patient Introduction: Mr. Gomez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male.  Presenting Complaint: A 10-day history of malaise  intermittent fever  and unintended weight loss.  Past Medical History: Diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his thirties  history of intravenous drug use (sober for approximately 15 years)  and untreated dental caries. He is also known to have diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled via lifestyle modification over the past 8 years.  Demographical note: Infectious endocarditis (IE) is commonly seen in males  especially in the age group of 30-60 years old. However  in native valve IE  it is also seen in an elderly patient with a prior history of rheumatic heart disease and/or degenerative valve disease. Additionally  the incidence of IE is higher in the Hispanic population compared to others  making Mr. Gomez a real representation of the population suffering from this disease.  Case Progression: A physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor  splinter hemorrhages under the nails  Janeway lesions on palms and soles  and Osler's nodes on his fingers. Cardiac auscultation identifies a new murmur suggestive of mitral valve regurgitation.   Preliminary Diagnosis: The patient's history and examination are consistent with a suspected diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Further Tests: He is sent for blood culture  full blood count  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  chest x-ray  and an urgent Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) to confirm the diagnosis and establish the severity.  This case scenario will guide the students to understand the common complaints  history  physical findings  demographics  and further management of patients suspected of having native-valve infective endocarditis. The student's goal is to synthesize a holistic approach to diagnose and manage the patient based on the information provided.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,95,Patient Information:  The patient is a 54-year-old male of African American descent who is working as a construction worker. He is unmarried and lives alone in an urban neighborhood. He is a smoker and has a 15-year history of intravenous drug use with multiple previous rehabilitation attempts.  Chief Complaint:  The patient came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of shortness of breath and a high-grade intermittent fever for the last two weeks.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of untreated Hepatitis C infection and a remote history of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection. He also has a history of hypertension which is not regularly treated due to his sporadic commitment to regular clinic visits. He denies any history of diabetes  cardiac conditions  surgery or allergies.  Review of Systems:  The patient reports unintentional weight loss (approximately 10 pounds in the last month)  night sweats  chills  and a new-onset  non-pruritic reddish rash on his trunk and extremities. He also reports fatigue and persistent cough but no hemoptysis  chest pain  orthopnea  or any gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. He denies recent contact with sick individuals or travel outside the country.  This case report covers an important and representative patient who might present with native-valve infective endocarditis  tying in statistical predisposition for high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users and certain ethnicities.

Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,96,Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 66-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  residential address: Midwest  USA  Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis  for which he is currently under chronic low-dose corticosteroids and methotrexate therapy for the last five years.  He has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit ten years ago. He is also known to have an occasional alcohol intake.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of mild intermittent fever for the past three weeks  progressive fatigue  and loss of appetite. Over the past one week  the patient also noticed the appearance of purplish spots on his skin and some pain in the soles of his feet. In addition  he noted an unexplained weight loss of around 6 Kg over the last month. There is no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He also denies any illicit drug use. His family mentioned that there is a change in his mood and a decrease in social activities.   This case represents a typical scenario of native-valve infective endocarditis  a condition generally occurring in males and commonly seen in older adults with a pre-existing heart condition or immune disorders. The patient characteristics and symptoms align with the demographic data found in medical literature  and the patient's history of corticosteroid and methotrexate use due to rheumatoid arthritis significantly increases his risk of developing an infection  such as endocarditis. Furthermore  his history of tobacco use and occasional alcohol intake can further weaken his immunity and cardiovascular health. The symptoms  including prolonged low-grade fever  fatigue  anorexia  weight loss  skin manifestations  and mood changes  are commonly observed in subacute infective endocarditis.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,97,Case Report: Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 65-year-old caucasian male  employed as an engineer  who resides in an urban setting. He is a non-smoker  occasionally consumes alcohol  and has no known recreational drug history. He does not engage in regular physical activity  has a high-fat diet but is not obese (BMI=24).  Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of moderate Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) with mitral valve insufficiency. This has been managed with prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and regular follow-up with his primary care physician. Additionally  he has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia which is kept under control by statin therapy. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Vital signs: Blood pressure 152/96mmHg  Pulse rate 98 bpm  Respiratory rate 16/min  Temperature 38.2 degrees Celsius (feverish)  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of a high-grade fever of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit over the past week  which is associated with chills. He also reports weakness and shortness of breath upon mild exertion  along with an unexplained weight loss of 15 pounds over the last month. He also exhibits signs of night sweats and malaise. He noticed small red spots on his palms and soles that have made him concerned.  This case represents infective endocarditis in a patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease  which is one of the most common risk factors for this condition according to studies. The demographic details align with the literature suggesting that males over 60 are most commonly affected.  For didactic purposes  it is worth noting that this case can enlighten learners about the high suspicion of infective endocarditis in any patient with pre-existing valvular disease who arrives with prolonged fever  systemic symptoms and vasculitic appearance. This case emphasizes the urgency of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent devastating sequalae of this serious condition.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,98,Patient Case: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis   Introduction: This case highlights the diagnostic process for identifying native-valve infective endocarditis  the implementation of the modified Duke criteria in diagnosis  the importance of early treatment  and long-term management.  Patient Information: A 60-year-old African American female presenting to the emergency room.  Past Medical History: 1. Diabetes Mellitus type II  diagnosed ten years ago  well controlled with Metformin. 2. Mild hypertension  controlled with medication.  Key Complaints: 1. Persistent  intermittent low-grade fever for the past two weeks. 2. Fatigue and unexplained weight loss over one month. 3. Recently developed a red  painless skin rash on her left hand.  Epidemiology Context: While infective endocarditis can affect individuals of any age and race  the prevalence increases with age  and it is slightly more common in males. Among races  the incidence is highest in African Americans. The patient's demographic data (age  gender  race) and medical history of diabetes and hypertension align with the literature.  Next Steps for Educators: Further discussion should focus on clinical examination  diagnostic findings (including laboratory and imaging tests)  the application of the modified Duke criteria for diagnosis  heart valve culture results  selection of antibiotic therapy  surgical intervention if required  and long-term patient management. This case should be utilized to emphasize the importance of suspecting infective endocarditis in patients with persistent fevers and vasculitis signs even in the absence of heart murmurs  especially those with predisposing conditions such as diabetes.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,99,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Peters Age: 63 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-week history of fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  intermittent fever  and a new onset persistent cough.  Past Medical History: Mr. Peters has a history of mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He does not have any history of illicit drug use  and he has no known allergies. He had one dental extraction two months ago.  Demographic Representation:  In the literature  it is mentioned that native-valve infective endocarditis is most commonly seen in males above 60 years of age with some form of cardiac damage or lesion. However  it is important to note that the disease can affect individuals from any demographic  but considering the typical patients  the chosen demographic here represents a relatively common scenario.  Teaching Focus:  This case provides medical students an opportunity to understand how to diagnose and manage a patient suspected of having native-valve infective endocarditis  with an emphasis on clinical history  physical examination  and appropriate investigations like blood cultures and echocardiography. As dental procedures can often lead to transient bacteremia  causing endocarditis in people with risk factors  this case emphasizes the importance of preventative strategies  and conveys the critical relationship between oral health and systemic disease. Further  they learn to identify risk factors for endocarditis  such as the patient's past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as well as long-term smoking history which might have contributed to cardiovascular disease  creating an environment for potential infection.
Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis,10,100,Patient Information:  55-year-old African American male who is a smoker with a 20 pack-year history.  Past Medical History:  - Diabetes Mellitus Type II - Hypertension  well-controlled with medication - History of intravenous drug use - No known drug allergies  Presenting Complaints:  - Four-day history of fever  night sweats - Shortness of breath on exertion - Generalized malaise and fatigue - Pain and swelling in right elbow - Recently noted a few small red spots on the skin (expected to be Janeway lesions)  The patient reports recent poor dental hygiene with a visit to the dentist six weeks ago which required intervention for an abscessed tooth. He denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts but admits to continued intravenous drug use.  Rationale:  This case was designed to mirror demographic trends identified in the literature  focusing specifically on native-valve infective endocarditis (IE)  a frequent and severe complication of bloodstream infections  which is often associated with poor dental hygiene  smoking  and more commonly observed in African American males.  In fact  published materials by Reller et al. (“Infective Endocarditis”) and Murdoch et al. (Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009) identified that IE disproportionately affects males and is associated with increasing age  making our 55-year-old male representative of a typical patient cohort. An additional significant risk factor is intravenous drug use  reflected in our patient's history.  The common symptoms of IE  such as fevers  night sweats  malaise  and shortness of breath on exertion  are included in the patient's complaints. The patient's right elbow pain and swelling could be pointing towards septic arthritis  a known complication of systemic infections such as IE.  The fever coinciding with the recent dental procedure points towards a possible entry point for the bacteria leading to IE  as poor dental hygiene is a common risk factor for this disease. Also  the small red spots may represent Janeway lesions  which are non-tender  small erythematous lesions found on the palms and soles  indicative of IE.   This patient's history and presentation amalgamate key risk factors and symptoms for native-valve infective endocarditis  presenting a comprehensive  evidence-based case for educational purposes.
